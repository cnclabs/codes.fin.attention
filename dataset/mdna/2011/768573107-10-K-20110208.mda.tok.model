table of contents in august  we began selling our steelhead mobile product line  which includes a software client version of our steelhead appliances  which delivers lan like application performance to any employee laptop  whether on the road  working from home or connected wirelessly in the office 
in february  we announced the introduction of the riverbed services platform rsp  which enables the delivery of virtualized edge services without the need to deploy additional physical servers at remote or branch offices 
rsp allows customers to deploy services from an array of vendors on steelhead appliances in a self contained partition to minimize the hardware infrastructure footprint at the branch office 
in august  we introduced the series steelhead appliances 
the series products represent the latest generation of our steelhead appliances 
in february  we acquired mazu networks 
mazu s cascade product line helps organizations manage  secure and optimize the availability and performance of global applications 
the acquisition allows us to meet enterprise and service provider customer demands by extending our suite of wan optimization products to include global application performance  reporting and analytics 
in october  we introduced the central management console virtual edition cmc ve designed for managed service providers msps 
the new capabilities of cmc ve allow msps to reduce operational costs  improve visibility  easily scale and flexibly allocate management licenses to enterprise customers through its new multi tenant capabilities 
cmc ve runs on vmware esx  and msps can deploy it on any existing server that has capacity 
in december  we introduced the latest implementation of riverbed services platform rsp in conjunction with version of rios 
rsp runs within the steelhead appliances  and now supports up to five simultaneous third party applications or services  including microsoft windows server  print server  dns dhcp  security  video and selected packages 
over time we expect additional products and services to become available for installation on rsp 
in february  we introduced the steelhead wan optimization appliance

in july  we introduced the virtual steelhead  a virtual version of the steelhead appliance 
virtual steelhead enables customers to deploy riverbed wan optimization solutions in a wider range of environments that may have specialized requirements such as ruggedized environments or environments with space limitations  as well as data centers that have been heavily virtualized 
in november  we introduced our cloud steelhead solution that is engineered for the public cloud 
cloud steelhead was designed to easily install and scale within cloud service provider environments in order to both accelerate the migration of data to the public cloud and improve performance for applications hosted in the public cloud 
in october  we acquired cace  which complemented the capabilities of our existing cascade offerings 
our cascade products allow us to meet enterprise and service provider customer demands by extending our suite of wan optimization products to include global application performance  reporting and analytics 
as part of our acquisition of cace  we became corporate sponsor for wireshark  an open source program that is widely used and well known in the networking community 
the acquisition of global protocols added its skipware technology to our wan optimization and will bolster our leadership position in delivering optimization solutions for satellite networks 

table of contents in december  we introduced our whitewater product  a cloud storage accelerator  designed to accelerate  de duplicate  and secure data that is to be stored in the public cloud 
whitewater is a cloud storage accelerator  designed to accelerate  de duplicate  and secure data that is to be stored in the public cloud 
increase market awareness to generate increased demand for our products  we will continue promoting our brand and the effectiveness of our comprehensive wan optimization solution 
scale our sales force and distribution channels growth in revenue and increase in share of market are key goals for us 
we intend to expand our direct sales force and leverage our indirect channels to extend our geographic reach and market penetration 
we sell our products directly through our sales force and indirectly through channel partners 
we derived of our revenue through indirect channels in we expect revenue from channel partners to continue to constitute a substantial majority of our future revenue 
enhance and extend our support and services capabilities on an ongoing basis  we plan to enhance and extend our support and services capabilities to continue to support our growing global customer base 
our support organization goals include providing customers with the highest service levels in the industry for hardware replacement and software support 
our sales organization is focused on maintaining a high rate of service contract renewals on our existing customer base 
our professional services team is focused on developing and distributing training programs directed at our partners  and expanding our professional service offering 
major trends affecting our financial results company outlook we believe that our current value proposition  which enables customers to improve the performance of their applications and access to their data across wans  while also offering the ability to simplify it infrastructure and realize significant capital and operating cost savings  should allow us to continue to grow our business 
our product revenue growth rate will depend significantly on continued growth in the wan optimization market  and our ability to continue to attract new customers in that market and generate additional sales from existing customers 
our growth in support and services revenue is dependent upon increasing the number of products under support contracts  which is dependent on both growing our installed base of customers and renewing existing support contracts 
our future profitability and rate of growth will be directly affected by the continued acceptance of our products in the marketplace  as well as the timing and size of orders  product mix  average selling prices and costs of our products and general economic conditions 
our ability to achieve profitability in the future will also be affected by the extent to which we must incur additional expenses to expand our sales  support  marketing  development  and general and administrative capabilities to grow our business 
the largest component of our expenses is personnel costs 
personnel costs consist of salaries  benefits and incentive compensation for our employees  including commissions for sales personnel and stock based compensation 
revenue our revenue has grown rapidly since we began shipping products in may  increasing from million in to million in revenue grew by in to million from million in we believe that our revenue growth in and  during periods in which 
table of contents the global macroeconomic environment negatively impacted many businesses  is a positive sign that our products have a significant value proposition to our customers and that the wan optimization market is still expanding despite the challenging macroeconomic environment 
costs and expenses operating expenses consist of sales and marketing  research and development  general and administrative expenses  and acquisition related costs 
personnel related costs  including stock based compensation  are the most significant component of each of these expense categories 
as of december   we had  employees  an increase of from the  employees at december  the increase in employees is the most significant driver behind the increase in costs and operating expenses in the increase in employees was required to support our increased revenue 
the timing of additional hires has and could materially affect our operating expenses  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue  in any particular period 
stock based compensation expense stock based compensation expense and related payroll taxes were million  million  and million in the years ended december    and respectively 
we expect to continue to incur significant stock based compensation expense and anticipate further growth in stock based compensation expense as our employee base grows because we expect stock based compensation to continue to play an important part in the overall compensation structure for our employees 
stock based compensation expense and related payroll tax was as follows year ended december  in thousands cost of product cost of support and services sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total stock based compensation expense and related payroll taxes acquisitions during fiscal  we acquired two companies to expand our product offerings 
these acquisitions were not significant  individually or in the aggregate 
combined  the total purchase price for these acquisitions was approximately million  which was paid in cash 
the purchase price allocation for these acquisitions included million of goodwill  million of identifiable intangible assets  million of in process research and development intangible assets  million of acquired debt  paid down at the acquisition date  and million of net tangible liabilities 
the results of operations of these companies are included in our consolidated results for the period subsequent to the acquisition date 
in the year ended december   we recognized million in revenue from the sale of these acquired companies products and services  and we recognized million of operating expenses  which included million of acquisition related intangible amortization  million of transaction and integration costs  million of acquisition related compensation costs and million of stock based compensation costs 

table of contents during  we acquired mazu 
the results of operations of mazu are included in our consolidated results for the period subsequent to the acquisition date 
in the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million in revenue  respectively  from the sale of mazu products and services 
in the years ended december  and  we recognized million and million  respectively  of acquisition related compensation costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates and judgments are made 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our consolidated financial statements could be adversely affected 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates  judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition  stock based compensation  accounting for business combinations  accounting for income taxes  inventory valuation and allowances for doubtful accounts 
our critical accounting policies have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition to remove tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality from the scope of industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
in october  the fasb also amended the accounting standards for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to i provide updated guidance on how the deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement should be separated  and how the consideration should be allocated  ii require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices esp of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price or third party evidence tpe of selling price  and iii eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
we elected to early adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of our first quarter of on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originating or materially modified after december  this guidance does not generally change the units of accounting for our revenue transactions 
most non software products and services qualify as separate units of accounting because they have value to the customer on a standalone basis and our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to delivered products 
the majority of our products are hardware appliances containing software components that function together to provide the essential functionality of the product 
therefore  our hardware appliances are considered non software deliverables and have been removed from the industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 

table of contents our product revenue also includes revenue from the sale of stand alone software products 
stand alone software may operate on our hardware appliance  but are not considered essential to the functionality of the hardware 
stand alone software sales generally include a perpetual license to our software 
stand alone software sales continue to be subject to the industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
for all transactions originating or materially modified after december   we recognize revenue in accordance with the amended accounting guidance 
certain arrangements with multiple deliverables may continue to have stand alone software deliverables that are subject to the existing software revenue recognition guidance along with non software deliverables that are subject to the amended revenue accounting guidance 
the revenue for these multiple deliverable arrangements is allocated to the stand alone software deliverables as a group and the non software deliverables based on the relative selling prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement using the fair value hierarchy in the amended revenue accounting guidance 
for stand alone software sales after december  and for all transactions entered into prior to the first quarter of  we recognize revenue based on software revenue recognition guidance 
under the software revenue recognition guidance  we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a product agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vsoe of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
in the majority of our contracts  the only element that remains undelivered at the time of delivery of the product is support services 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the contract fee is recognized as product revenue 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  all revenue is generally deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
when the undelivered element for which we do not have vsoe of fair value is support  revenue for the entire arrangement is bundled and recognized ratably over the support period 
vsoe of fair value for elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those services when sold separately  and vsoe for support services is further measured by the renewal rate offered to the customer 
in determining vsoe  we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range  generally evidenced by a substantial majority of such historical stand alone transactions falling within a reasonably narrow range of the median rates 
in addition  we consider major service groups  geographies  customer classifications  and other variables in determining vsoe 
for our non software deliverables we allocate the arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of the deliverables 
for our hardware appliances we use esp as our selling price 
for our support and services  we generally use vsoe as our selling price 
when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe for our support and services  we use esp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
we are typically not able to determine tpe for our products or services 
tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately 
generally  our go to market strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained 
furthermore  we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products selling prices are on a stand alone basis 
when we are unable to establish selling price of our non software deliverables using vsoe or tpe  we use esp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 

table of contents we determine esp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  cost of products  gross margin objectives  pricing practices  geographies  customer classes and distribution channels 
we regularly review vsoe and esp and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates 
there were no material impacts during the year nor do we currently expect a material impact in the near term from changes in vsoe or esp 
the impact from the adoption of the amended revenue recognition rules to total revenue  income from continuing operations  net income and related per share amounts  and deferred revenue was not considered material 
in the year ended december   we recognized million of software revenue under the industry specific software revenue recognition rules 
software revenue includes revenue from stand alone software  hardware appliances  support and services on arrangements entered into before january  software revenue also includes all stand alone software arrangements and support contract renewals entered into after december  in the year ended december   we recognized million of non software revenue under the amended revenue recognition guidance for multiple deliverable arrangements for non software deliverables 
non software revenue includes hardware appliance revenue  support contracts sold with hardware appliances  and related services on arrangements entered into after december  as of december   we recorded million of deferred product revenue related to sales under the industry specific software revenue recognition rules and million of deferred product revenue related to sales under the amended revenue recognition guidance for multiple deliverable arrangements for non software deliverables 
in terms of the timing and pattern of revenue recognition  the amended accounting guidance for revenue recognition did not have a significant effect on net sales  and is not expected to have a significant effect on net sales in periods after the initial adoption 
however  we expect that this amended accounting guidance will facilitate our efforts to optimize our offerings due to better alignment between the economics of an arrangement and the related accounting 
this may lead us to engage in new go to market practices in the future 
in particular  we expect that the amended accounting standards will enable us to better integrate products and services without vsoe into existing offerings and solutions 
as our go to market strategies evolve  we may modify our pricing practices in the future  which could result in changes in selling prices  including both vsoe and esp 
as a result  our future revenue recognition for multiple deliverable arrangements could differ materially from the results in the current period 
product revenue consists of revenue from sales of our hardware appliances and perpetual software licenses 
we recognize product revenue when all of the following have occurred we have entered into a legally binding arrangement with a customer  delivery has occurred  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies and significant uncertainties  and collection is reasonably assured 
for sales to direct end users and channel partners  including value added resellers  value added distributors  service providers  and systems integrators  we recognize product revenue upon delivery  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
for our hardware appliances  delivery occurs upon transfer of title and risk of loss  which is generally upon shipment 
it is our practice to identify an end user prior to shipment to a channel partner 
for end users and channel partners  we generally have no significant obligations for future performance such as rights of return or pricing credits 
a portion of our sales are made through distributors under agreements allowing for stocking of our products in their inventory  pricing credits and limited rights of return for stock rotation 
product revenue on sales made through these distributors is initially deferred and revenue is recognized upon sell through as reported by the distributors to us 
shipping charges billed to customers are included in product revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of product revenue 

table of contents support and services consist of support agreements  professional services  and training 
support services include repair and replacement of defective hardware appliances  software updates and access to technical support personnel 
software updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades and to maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period 
revenue for support services is recognized on a straight line basis over the service contract term  which is typically one to three years 
professional services are recognized upon delivery or completion of performance 
professional service arrangements are typically short term in nature and are largely completed within days from the start of service 
training services are recognized upon delivery of the training 
our fees are typically considered to be fixed or determinable at the inception of an arrangement  generally based on specific products and quantities to be delivered 
substantially all of our contracts do not include rights of return or acceptance provisions 
to the extent that our agreements contain such terms  we recognize revenue once the customer has accepted  or once the acceptance provisions or right of return lapses 
payment terms to customers generally range from net to days 
in the event payment terms are provided that differ from our standard business practices  the fees are deemed to not be fixed or determinable and revenue is recognized when the payments become due  provided the remaining criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
we assess the ability to collect from our customers based on a number of factors  including credit worthiness of the customer and past transaction history of the customer 
if the customer is not deemed credit worthy  we defer revenue from the arrangement until payment is received and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
stock based compensation stock based awards granted include stock options  restricted stock units rsus  and stock purchased under our employee stock purchase plan the purchase plan 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the awards  and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period only for those equity awards expected to vest 
the fair value of the rsus is determined based on the stock price on the date of grant 
we estimated the fair value of stock options and stock purchased under our purchase plan using the black scholes model 
this model utilizes the estimated fair value of common stock and requires that  at the date of grant  we use the expected term of the grant  the expected volatility of the price of our common stock  risk free interest rates and expected dividend yield of our common stock 
the fair value is amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally three to four years for stock options and six months to two years for stock purchased under our purchase plan 
the expected term represents the period that stock options are expected to be outstanding 
during the first three quarters of and for the years ended december  and  we elected to use the simplified method of determining the expected term of stock options due to insufficient historical exercise data as a publicly traded company 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that we had sufficient historical information to use a method based on hypothetical exercises  which we believe is more representative of our expected term 
during the first three quarters of and for the years ended december  and  the computation of our expected volatility for stock options was based on the historical volatility of comparable companies from a representative peer group selected based on industry  financial and market capitalization data  due to insufficient historical volatility data as a publicly traded company 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that we had sufficient historical volatility data to use a 
table of contents blended historical and implied volatility 
the computation of expected volatility for the purchase plan for the years ended december  and is based on our historical volatility 
the computation of expected volatility for the purchase plan for the year ended december  is based on historical volatility of comparable companies 
accounting for business combinations in our business combinations  we are required to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies  and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date 
the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at acquisition date with respect to intangible assets  estimated contingent consideration payments and pre acquisition contingencies 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made have been reasonable and appropriate  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired company and are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates in accounting for acquisitions include but are not limited to the estimated fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration  which is performed using a probability weighted discounted cash flow model based upon the forecasted achievement of post acquisition bookings targets  the future expected cost to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and the estimated cash flows from the products when completed  the future expected cash flows from product sales  support agreements  consulting contracts  other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  and the discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
additionally  any change in the fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date  including changes from events after the acquisition date  such as changes in our estimate of the bookings that are expected to be achieved  will be recognized in earnings in the period of the estimated fair value change 
goodwill  intangible assets and impairment assessments goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter and more frequently if certain indicators are present 
in the event that we determine that the carrying value of our single reporting unit is less than the reporting unit s fair value  we will incur an impairment charge for the amount of the difference during the quarter in which the determination is made 
we performed our annual review of goodwill in the fourth quarter of and concluded that no impairment existed at december  intangible assets that are not considered to have an indefinite life are amortized over their useful lives 
each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful life of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
the carrying amounts of these assets are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
in the event that we determine 
table of contents certain assets are not fully recoverable  we will incur an impairment charge for those assets or portion thereof during the quarter in which the determination is made  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expenses or benefits are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
the measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on provisions of currently enacted tax laws 
the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not contemplated 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax expense and tax contingencies in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating current income tax expense together with assessing temporary differences in the treatment of items for tax purposes versus financial accounting purposes that may create net deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we rely on estimates and assumptions in preparing our income tax provision including forecasted annual income 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets  including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction  expectations of future taxable income  and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes  as well as other relevant factors 
we may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses  future changes in income tax law  or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results  we make certain judgments and estimates 
therefore  actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates 
as part of our accounting for business combinations  a portion of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill and intangible assets 
amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible  however  deferred taxes have been recorded for non deductible amortization expenses as a part of the purchase price allocation 
in the event of an impairment charge associated with goodwill  such charges are generally not tax deductible and would increase the effective tax rate in the quarter any impairment is recorded 
we are subject to periodic audits by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities 
these audits may challenge certain tax positions we have taken  such as the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of taxable income to the various tax jurisdictions 
income tax contingencies are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance  and may require significant management judgment in estimating final outcomes 
actual results could materially differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the effective tax rate and cash flows in future years 
inventory valuation inventory consists of hardware and related component parts and is stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
a portion of our inventory relates to evaluation units located at customer locations  as some of our customers test our equipment prior to purchasing 
inventory that is obsolete or in excess of our forecasted demand is written down to its estimated realizable value based on historical usage  expected demand  and with respect to evaluation units  the historical conversion rate  age of the units and the estimated loss of utility 
inherent in our estimates of market value in determining inventory valuation are estimates related to economic trends  future demand for our 
table of contents products  the timing of new product introductions and technological obsolescence of our products 
inventory write downs are reflected as cost of product and amounted to million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
allowances for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the applicable portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding receivables 
for those receivables not specifically reviewed  provisions are provided at differing rates  based upon the age of the receivable 
in determining these percentages  we analyze our historical collection experience and current economic trends 
if the historical data we use to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
results of operations revenue we derive our revenue from sales of our appliances and software licenses and from support and services 
product revenue primarily consists of revenue from sales of our steelhead and cascade products and is typically recognized upon shipment 
support and services revenue includes unspecified software license updates and product support 
support revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual period  which is typically one year 
service revenue includes professional services and training  which to date has not been significant  and is recognized as the services are performed

table of contents we believe the market for our products has grown due to increased market awareness of wan optimization services and distributed organizations  which increases dependence on timely access to data and applications 
as of december   our products had been sold to over  customers  compared to approximately  as of december  substantially all of our customers purchase support when they purchase our products 
support and services revenue increased in as compared to which is consistent with our growth in product revenue 
support and services revenue as a percentage of total revenues remained relatively consistent with the prior year as our renewal rate of support contracts by existing customers remained stable 
as our customer base grows  we expect our revenue generated from support and services to increase  however  we expect the renewal rate of support contracts by existing customers to remain level 
we generated of our revenue in the year ended december  from international locations  compared to in the year ended december  we continue to expand into international locations and introduce our products in new markets and expect international revenue to increase in dollar amount over time 
compared to product revenue increased by in due primarily to an increase in unit volume from increasing sales to existing customers and the addition of new customers 
as of december   our products had been sold to over  customers  compared to approximately  as of december  support and services revenue increased on an absolute basis and as a percentage of total revenue due primarily to an increase in the renewal rate of support contracts by existing customers and also on an increase in the installed base 
the increase in the renewal rate of support contracts by existing customers was a result of a focused sales effort to drive support contract renewals 
in each of the years ended december  and  we derived and  respectively  of our revenue from indirect channels 
we expect indirect channel revenue to continue to be a substantial majority of our revenue 
cost of revenue and gross margin cost of product revenue consists of the costs of the appliance hardware  manufacturing  shipping and logistics costs and expenses for inventory obsolescence  warranty obligations and amortization of acquisition related intangibles 
we utilize third parties to assist in the design of and to manufacture our appliance hardware  embed our proprietary software and perform shipping logistics 
cost of support and service revenue consists of personnel costs of technical support and professional services personnel  spare parts and logistics services 
as we expand internationally and into other sectors  we may incur additional costs to conform our products to comply with local laws or local product specifications 
in addition  as we expand internationally  we will continue to hire additional technical support personnel to support our growing international customer base 

table of contents our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including the mix and average selling prices of our products  new product introductions and enhancements  the cost of our appliance hardware  expenses for inventory obsolescence and warranty obligations  cost of support and service personnel  and the mix of distribution channels through which our products are sold

the increase in cost of product revenue was also attributable to increased shipping costs of million primarily due to an increase in unit volume  amortization of acquisition related intangible assets of million and million related to the fair value adjustment of inventory sold from our recently acquired entity 
cost of support and services revenue increased as we added more technical support headcount domestically and abroad to support our growing customer base 
technical support and services headcount was employees as of december  compared to employees as of december  gross margins increased to in the year ended december  from in the year ended december  primarily due to higher margins on product revenue as a result of lower unit product costs as well as a favorable product mix 
product gross margins increased to in the year ended december  from in the year ended december  as a result of volume leverage and favorable product mix 
gross margins for support and services remained at 
compared to the increase in cost of product revenue was due primarily to increased unit volume associated with higher revenue 
the increase in cost of product revenue was primarily due to increased manufacturing overhead of million  and amortization of acquisition related intangibles of million 
manufacturing overhead includes costs of manufacturing personnel and related costs  logistics services  and royalties 
these increases were offset by lower per unit purchase price of product of million  lower inventory write downs of million  lower warranty related costs of million  and lower shipping costs of million 
cost of support and services revenue increased as we added more technical support headcount domestically and abroad to support our growing customer base 
technical support and services headcount was employees as of december  compared to employees as of december  additionally  costs related to freight  logistics  and inventory consumption increased due to increased infrastructure to support the increased installed base 

table of contents product gross margins increased to in the year ended december  from in the year ended december  primarily due lower unit product costs  lower inventory write downs  lower warranty costs which were partially offset by higher manufacturing overhead and acquisition related intangible amortization 
gross margins for support and services increased to as a result of revenues increasing at a higher rate than support and services costs 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses represent the largest component of our operating expenses and include personnel costs  sales commissions  marketing programs and facilities costs 
marketing programs are intended to generate revenue from new and existing customers  and are expensed as incurred 
we plan to continue to make investments in sales and marketing with the intent to add new customers and increase penetration within our existing customer base by increasing the number of sales personnel worldwide  expanding our domestic and international sales and marketing activities  increasing channel penetration  building brand awareness and sponsoring additional marketing events 
we expect future sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase and continue to be our most significant operating expense 
generally  sales personnel are not immediately productive and sales and marketing expenses do not immediately result in increased revenue 
hiring additional sales personnel reduces short term operating margins until the sales personnel become productive and generate revenue 
accordingly  the timing of sales personnel hiring and the rate at which they become productive will affect our future performance

our income tax provision benefit consists of federal  foreign  and state income taxes 
our effective tax rate was   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
our effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate due to state taxes  significant permanent differences  relative profitability by jurisdiction and the change in our valuation allowances on our net deferred tax assets 
significant permanent differences arise from the portion of stock based compensation expense that is not expected to generate a tax deduction  such as stock compensation expense on grants to certain foreign employees  our employee stock purchase plan and incentive stock options  offset by the actual tax benefits in the current periods from disqualifying dispositions of those shares 
beginning in  we expect our effective tax rate to be impacted by our entering into an intercompany research and development program with our singapore subsidiary 
for years prior to  we recorded a full valuation allowance because of the uncertainty of the realization of the deferred tax assets 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent primarily upon future taxable income 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we have considered our historical levels of income  expectations of future taxable income and on going tax planning strategies 
in the year ended december   management reevaluated the need for a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets as a result of cumulative profits generated in the most recent three year period as well as other positive evidence 
as a result of this evaluation  we concluded that it is more likely than not that we will realize sufficient earnings to utilize a significant portion of our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we reversed the valuation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets and recorded a benefit of million 
this benefit was partially offset by a provision for income taxes of million related to federal  state and local taxes 
at december  we maintained a valuation allowance on foreign deferred tax assets 
in the year ended december   management reevaluated the need for a valuation allowance on our foreign deferred tax assets 
as a result of this evaluation  we concluded that it is more likely than not that we will realize sufficient future taxable income to utilize our foreign deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we reversed the valuation allowance against our foreign deferred tax assets and recorded an income tax benefit of million in as part of our accounting for the acquisition of mazu in  we established deferred tax assets for federal net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credit carryforwards that are subject to limitation under sections and of the internal revenue code 
accordingly  we recorded a valuation allowance of million related to a portion of the federal net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credit carryforwards that we do not expect to be realized 
any subsequent reduction of the valuation allowance and the recognition of the associated tax benefits will be recorded to our provision for income taxes 
in the year ended december   management concluded that a valuation allowance was needed on our california income tax credit carryforwards 
due to a change in the company s forecasted income allocated to california for tax years after  it is more likely than not that the 
table of contents california income tax credits carryforwards as of december  will not be utilized in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we established a valuation allowance against the tax credits and recorded additional income tax expense of million in we are subject to potential income tax audits on open tax years by any taxing jurisdiction in which we operate in 
the taxing authorities of the most significant jurisdictions are the united states internal revenue service  california franchise tax board and hm revenue and customs in the united kingdom uk 
we do not anticipate any material adjustments to our tax provisions relating to previously filed tax returns 
the statute of limitations for federal  state  and uk tax purposes are generally three  four  and one year s respectively  however  we continue to carryover tax attributes prior to these periods for federal and state purposes  which would still be open for examination by the respective tax authorities

table of contents you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance 
in addition  a significant portion of our quarterly sales typically occurs during the last month of the quarter  which we believe reflects customer buying patterns of products similar to ours and other products in the technology industry generally 
as a result  our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict even in the near term 
commencing with the first shipment of our products in the second quarter of  revenue has increased sequentially in all but one quarter  due to increases in the number of products and support and services sold to new and existing customers and international expansion 
cost of revenue has increased sequentially each quarter in absolute dollars  but has decreased over time as a percentage of revenue 
the increase in gross margins is primarily due to higher margins on product revenue as a result of lower unit product costs 
operating expenses have increased over time  as we continued to add headcount and related costs to accommodate our growing business

the fair value of our investments has not materially fluctuated from historical cost 
the accumulated unrealized gains losses  net of tax  on investments recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our stockholders equity as of december  is million 
the recent volatility in the credit markets has increased the risk of material fluctuations in the fair value of marketable securities 
cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments increased by million to million in the year ended december  pursuant to certain lease agreements and as security for our merchant services agreement with our principal financial institution  we are required to maintain cash reserves  classified as restricted cash 
current restricted cash totaled zero at december  and million at december  long term restricted cash totaled million at december  and long term restricted cash is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets and consists primarily of funds held as collateral for letters of credit for the security deposit on the leases of our corporate headquarters and is restricted until the end of the lease terms on july  
table of contents since the fourth quarter of  we have expanded our operations internationally 
our sales contracts are principally denominated in us dollars and therefore changes in foreign exchange rates have not materially affected our cash flows from operations 
as we fund our international operations  our cash and cash equivalents are affected by changes in exchange rates 
to date  the foreign currency effect on our cash and cash equivalents has not been material 
cash provided by operating activities our largest source of operating cash flows is the cash collections from our customers 
our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures  product costs  outside services  and rent payments 
our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we grow our revenue and spend on hiring personnel in order to grow our business 
the timing of hiring sales personnel in particular affects cash flows as there is a lag between the hiring of sales personnel and the generation of revenue and related cash flows from their sales efforts 
cash provided by operating activities increased by million to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the increase in cash flow from operating activities was due to an increase in cash flow of million from operations after adjusting for non cash items  including depreciation and amortization  and stock based compensation  and million from the change in operating assets and liabilities 
cash provided by operating activities was million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  the increase in cash flow from operating activities was due to an increase in cash flow of million from operations after adjusting for non cash items  including depreciation and amortization  and stock based compensation  and million from the change in operating assets and liabilities

cash used in investing activities in includes million used for acquisitions  million used for capital expenditures  and million used to purchase short term investments 
cash used in investing activities increased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to the million used for acquisitions 
this was partially offset by lower purchases of marketable securities and lower capital expenditures

table of contents million in compared to million in of the million used for the mazu acquisition related contingent consideration in the year ended december   million was estimated as of the acquisition date  and therefore recorded as a financing cash outflow 
there were no acquisition related contingent consideration payments in the year ended december  we used million of cash in to pay down debt assumed in the global protocols acquisition and we used million to pay down the debt acquired in the acquisition of mazu in the year ended december  cash used in financing activities was million in the year ended december  cash used for repurchases of common stock was million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  cash provided from the exercise of stock options was million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december   cash used to pay down the debt acquired in the acquisition of mazu was million in the year ended december  we believe that our net proceeds from operations  together with our cash and investments balance at december   will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the timing and extent of expansion into new territories  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  and the continuing market acceptance of our products 
in the fourth quarter of  we acquired cace and global protocols for approximately million of cash and in february  we acquired mazu for approximately million of cash  which was paid from our existing cash balance 
in the future  we may enter into other arrangements for potential investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  services or technologies  which could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  year ending december  in thousands total thereafter contractual obligations operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations represents amounts associated with agreements that are enforceable  legally binding and specify terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of payment 
obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes  nor did we have any undisclosed material transactions or commitments involving related persons or entities

recent accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for recent accounting pronouncements that could have an effect on us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk our sales contracts are principally denominated in us dollars and therefore our revenue and receivables are not subject to significant foreign currency risk 
we do incur certain operating expenses in currencies other than the us dollar and therefore are subject to volatility in cash flows due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the british pound  euro  australian dollar and singapore dollar 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging contracts since exchange rate fluctuations have had minimal impact on our operating results and cash flows 
in addition  sales would be negatively affected if we chose to more heavily discount our product price in foreign markets to maintain competitive pricing 
interest rate sensitivity we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  and investments totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
cash and cash equivalents of million and million at december  and december   respectively  are held for working capital purposes and include highly liquid investments with a maturity of ninety days or less at the time of purchase 
cash equivalents consist primarily of money market mutual funds  government sponsored enterprise obligations  treasury bills  and other money market securities 
investments of million and million at december  and december   respectively  consist of government sponsored enterprise obligations  treasury bills  fdic backed certificates of deposit and corporate bonds and notes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
due to the high investment quality and relatively short duration of these investments  we do not believe that we have any material exposure to changes in the fair market value as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future investment income 
the volatility in the credit markets in late through mid caused a macro shift in investments into highly liquid short term investments such as us treasury bills 
this has caused a significant decline in short term interest rates  which resulted in a significant reduction in our investment income 
this macro economic trend of lower interest rates on high quality interest bearing investments continued throughout in addition  the volatility in the credit markets increases the risk of write downs of investments to fair market value
