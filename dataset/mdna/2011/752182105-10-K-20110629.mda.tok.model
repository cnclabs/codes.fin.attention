overview business rand logistics  inc formerly rand acquisition corporation was incorporated in the state of delaware on june  as a blank check company to effect a merger  capital stock exchange  asset acquisition or other similar business combination with an operating business 
on march   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of lower lakes towing ltd  a canadian corporation which  with its subsidiary lower lakes transportation company  provides bulk freight shipping services throughout the great lakes region 
as part of the acquisition of lower lakes  we also acquired lower lakes affiliate  grand river navigation company  inc prior to the acquisition  we did not conduct  or have any investment in  any operating business 
subsequent to the acquisition  we have added several additional vessels to our fleet through acquisition transactions 
most recently we acquired two integrated tug and barge units through black creek 
our shipping business is operated in canada by lower lakes towing and in the united states by lower lakes transportation 
lower lakes towing was organized in march under the laws of canada to provide marine transportation services to dry bulk goods suppliers and purchasers operating in ports on the great lakes that were restricted in their ability to receive larger vessels 
lower lakes has grown from its origin as a small tug and barge operator to a full service shipping company with a fleet of fourteen cargo carrying vessels 
from its exclusively canadian beginnings  lower lakes has also grown to offer domestic services to both canadian and us customers as well as cross border routes 
lower lakes services the construction  electric utility  integrated steel and food industries through the transportation of limestone  coal  iron ore  salt  grain and other dry bulk commodities 
we believe that lower lakes is the only company providing significant domestic port to port services to both canada and the united states in the great lakes region 
lower lakes maintains this operating flexibility by operating both us and canadian flagged vessels in compliance with the shipping act   and the merchant marine act   commonly referred to as the jones act  in the us and the coasting trade act canada in canada 
results of operations for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  the fiscal year ended march  was highlighted by several significant events as compared to the fiscal year ended march  
table of contents we experienced mechanical incidents during the fiscal year ended march   resulting in approximately days of downtime including sailing days  which we define as days a vessel is crewed and available for sailing and approximately million in repair costs below our insurance deductible limits 
in addition  we recorded approximately million of assessments from one of our insurance carriers due to unusually large losses experienced by that insurer during that policy year 
our inability to utilize such vessels while they were being repaired created inefficiencies in our trade patterns caused by the substitution of sub optimal vessels into the trade routes of the affected vessels 
the fiscal year ended march  was also highlighted by several significant changes in our markets compared to the fiscal year ended march  there was an overall increase in demand of approximately in our markets during the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march   when a weakened economy significantly delayed the start of the sailing season 
during the fiscal year ended march   a stronger steel industry resulted in an approximate two thirds increase in shipments of iron ore and  to a lesser extent  an increase in shipments of coal and aggregates 
there were also modest increases in export grain markets  offset by reductions in our salt markets compared to the fiscal year ended march  we experienced a increase in freight revenue  excluding the impact of currency translation  during the fiscal year ended march   which was lower than the overall market increase due to our mechanical incidents and our lower reliance on the steel industry compared to our competitors 
this increase in freight revenue was primarily attributable to price increases and an increase in the number of sailing days in the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  our total sailing days increased days  or  to  sailing days during the fiscal year ended march  from  sailing days during the fiscal year ended march  the increase in sailing days was a result of stronger overall markets and the full season sailing of the mckee sons  which we operated for an additional sailing days in the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march   when it was laid up for the beginning of the sailing season 
this increase was offset by the loss of sailing days due to mechanical incidents on several of our vessels during the fiscal year ended march  we benefited from additional new business and contractual rate increases from existing customers during the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  all of our customer contracts have fuel surcharge provisions whereby the increases and decreases in our fuel costs are passed on to customers 
such increases and decreases in fuel surcharges impact our margin percentages  but do not significantly impact our margin dollars 
due to the increased number of sailing days  higher fuel prices and a stronger canadian dollar during the fiscal year ended march   fuel surcharge revenues increased compared to the fiscal year ended march  the canadian dollar strengthened by approximately versus the us dollar  averaging approximately usd per cdn during the fiscal year ended march  compared to approximately usd per cdn during the fiscal year ended march  the company s balance sheet translation rate increased from usd per cdn at march   to usd per cdn at march  we acquired two vessels on february  after the sailing season had ended 
we incurred approximately million of cash operating expenses  million of depreciation and interest expense  as well as million of capital expenditures accrued including million unpaid at march  related to these acquired vessels

freight and other related revenue generated from the company s owned vessels increased million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  freight and related revenue per sailing day increased to  per sailing day in the fiscal year ended march  compared to  per sailing day during the fiscal year ended march  this increase was attributable to the strength of the canadian dollar and price increases during the fiscal year ended march   which were largely offset by inefficiencies in our trade patterns as a result of the substitution of sub optimal vessels into the trade routes of our vessels that experienced mechanical incidents 
fuel and other surcharges increased million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  fuel and other surcharges per sailing day increased  to  per sailing day in the fiscal year ended march  compared to  per sailing day in the fiscal year ended march  
table of contents outside voyage charter revenues decreased million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in outside voyage charter revenues was due to our ability to meet our customer s sailing season deliveries with reduced reliance on outside charterers  offset by a stronger canadian dollar during the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  vessel operating expenses increased million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  compared to million in the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily attributable to higher fuel costs  a stronger canadian dollar  an increase in the number of sailing days  the costs of repairs of vessel incidents under deductibles and assessments from an insurance carrier during the fiscal year ended march  vessel operating expenses per sailing day increased  or  to  per sailing day in the fiscal year ended march  from  per sailing day in the fiscal year ended march  repairs and maintenance expenses  which primarily consist of expensed winter work  increased to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  repairs and maintenance per sailing day decreased to  per sailing day in the fiscal year ended march  from  per sailing day in the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily due to the stronger canadian dollar in the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  our general and administrative expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march  this increase was a result of the stronger canadian dollar  higher restricted stock amortization expenses and higher legal costs in the fiscal year ended march   compared to the fiscal year ended march   which included a loan amendment fee of our general and administrative expenses represented of revenues during the fiscal year ended march   a decrease from of revenues during the fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   million of our general and administrative expenses was attributable to our parent company and million was attributable to our operating companies 
depreciation expense decreased million to million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in depreciation expense was attributable to the completion of depreciation in the fiscal year ended march  of our oldest vessel acquired in our march acquisition of lower lakes  partially offset by increased depreciation from capital expenditures during the winter layup period and a stronger canadian dollar in the fiscal year ended march  amortization of drydock costs increased to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march   due to the drydocking of the manistee during the fiscal winter lay up period and the stronger canadian dollar in the fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   the company amortized the deferred drydock costs of eight of its twelve operated vessels  compared to seven vessels during the fiscal year ended march  amortization of intangibles decreased to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  due to the completion of amortizing certain acquired non competition agreements during the fiscal year ended march as a result of the items described above  during the fiscal year ended march   the company s operating income decreased million to million compared to operating income of million during the fiscal year ended march  interest expense increased to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  this increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to higher average debt balances due to the million increase in the canadian term loan partially offset by a lower revolver debt balance and the million black creek loan  including the higher amortization of deferred financing costs  partially offset by interest expense capitalized with the capital expenditures of the repowering of the michipicoten 
we recorded a gain on interest rate swap contracts of in the fiscal year ended march  compared to a gain of million recorded in the fiscal year ended march  due to the recording of the fair value of our two interest rate swaps at the end of each such period 

table of contents in connection with the guarantee described under the heading off balance sheet arrangements  below  we recorded a loss contingency of million on lower lakes towing s guarantee of voyageur s indebtedness with ge canada  following the maritime trader s placement in receivership as of march  we believe that the fair value of the maritime trader  which requires drydocking and steel renewal investments  is less than the estimated value of ge canada s total claim by at least the amount of lower lakes towing s million guarantee 
our income before income taxes was in the fiscal year ended march  compared to income before income taxes of million in the fiscal year ended march  our provision for income tax expense was during the fiscal year ended march  compared to a provision for income tax expense of million during the fiscal year ended march  income tax expense decreased compared to the fiscal year ended march  due to lower income before income taxes 
our net income before preferred stock dividends was in the fiscal year ended march  compared to million in the fiscal year ended march  we accrued million for cash dividends on our preferred stock during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  the dividends accrued at a rate of during the three month period ended march  if the dividends are not paid in cash  the rate will increase to a cap of effective july  our net income applicable to common stockholders was a loss of million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to income of million during the fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   the company operated an average of approximately five vessels in the us and seven vessels in canada 
the percentage of our total freight and other revenue  fuel and other surcharge revenue  vessel operating expenses  repairs and maintenance costs  and combined depreciation and amortization costs  approximate the percentage of vessel ownership by country 
our outside voyage charter revenue and costs relate solely to our canadian subsidiary and approximately of our general and administrative costs are incurred in canada 
approximately of our interest expense is incurred in canada  consistent with our percentage of overall indebtedness by country 
approximately of our gain on interest rate swap contracts was realized in canada based on the larger amount of indebtedness and greater increase of interest rates in canada than in the us during the fiscal year ended march  all of our preferred stock dividends are accrued in the us 
impact of inflation and changing prices during the fiscal year ended march   there were major fluctuations in our fuel costs 
however  our contracts with our customers provide for recovery of these costs over specified rates through fuel surcharges 
in addition  there was significant volatility in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar during the past two fiscal years  which impacted our translation of revenue and costs to us dollars by an increase of approximately during the fiscal year ended march  liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations  the proceeds of our credit facility and proceeds from sales of our common stock 
our principal uses of cash are vessel acquisitions  capital expenditures  drydock expenditures  operations and interest and principal payments under our credit facility 
information on our consolidated cash flow is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows categorized by operating  investing and financing activities which is included in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended march  and march  the company makes seasonal net borrowings under its revolving credit facility during the first quarter of each fiscal year to fund working capital needed to commence the sailing season 
such borrowings are then paid down during the second half of each fiscal year 
we believe cash generated from our operations and availability of borrowings under our credit facility will provide sufficient cash availability to cover our anticipated working capital needs  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the next twelve months 
however  if the company experiences a material shortfall to its financial forecasts or if the company s customers materially delay their receivable payments due to further deterioration of economic conditions  the company may breach its financial covenants and collateral thresholds and be strained for liquidity 
the company has maintained its focus on productivity gains and cost controls  and is closely monitoring customer credit and accounts receivable balances 

table of contents net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended march  was million  a decrease of million compared to million in the fiscal year ended march  this decrease was primarily due to lower operating income and an increase in working capital in the fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   the sum of net income and adjustments to reconcile with net cash provided by operating activities totaled million  including million of equity compensation  offset by deferred drydock costs paid of million and net cash used from changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
during the fiscal year ended march   the sum of net income plus adjustments to reconcile with net cash provided by operating activities totaled million  including million of equity compensation  offset by deferred drydock costs paid of million and net cash used from changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
the company did not incur any significant bad debt write offs or material slowdowns in receivable collections during the fiscal year ended march  the timing of the end of the company s fiscal year in relation to the sailing season allows most of a sailing season s receivables to be collected prior to the end of the company s fiscal year 
in addition  the earlier start of a sailing season prior to april  can modestly increase the amount of accounts receivable and accounts payable in the company s balance sheet at the end of our fiscal year 
cash used in investing activities increased by million to net cash used of million during the fiscal year ended march  from net cash used of million during the fiscal year ended march  our capital expenditures paid increased million primarily due to the timing of payments made on the new engine installation on the michipicoten and million paid in connection with the acquisition of two vessels in the fiscal year ended march  cash provided in financing activities increased million to million provided during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million used in the fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   the company received debt proceeds of million  received proceeds from shares issued of million and made principal payments on its term debt of million 
during the fiscal year ended march   the company made a net paydown of its revolving credit facility of million and made principal payments on its term debt of million 
during the fiscal year ended march   long term debt  including the current portion  increased million to million from million in the fiscal year ending march   including million of new loans offset by million in scheduled principal payments  as well as a million increase due to the stronger canadian dollar 
in addition  the company received a seller note and deferred payment liabilities valued at million in connection with the acquisition of two vessels in the fiscal year ended march  our amended and restated credit agreement  as amended  requires the company to meet certain quarterly and annual financial covenants  including minimum ebitda as defined therein  minimum fixed charge ratios  maximum senior debt to ebitda ratios  and maximum capital expenditures and drydock expenditures 
the company met those financial covenants during the fiscal year ended march  the covenants are set in canadian dollars in order to better match the cash earnings and debt levels of the business by currency

seasonality lower lakes operates in a cyclical industry  primarily due to the typical cold weather patterns on the great lakes from december through march which cause lock closures  waterway ice  and customer facility closings  which typically shut down shipping for a period of up to days commencing from late december to mid january  and continuing until late march 
lower lakes also experiences a cyclical pattern for its capital spending cycle  typically off season from the shipping revenues  to permit annual maintenance and investment in the vessels 
this places additional adverse pressures on lower lakes liquidity and capital resources 
such winter work  capital expenditure  and drydocking costs are incurred during a period when customer collections have ended from the prior season  and fit out and vessel operating costs will be incurred at the beginning of the season as much as to days prior to the receipt of significant customer collections 
to counter these negative working capital cycles  lower lakes amended and restated credit facility includes a revolver feature with a seasonal overadvance facility which provides working capital from the march through july period  after which customer collections typically exceed cash disbursements

the accrued dividend payable at march  was million compared to million at march  as of march   the effective rate of preferred dividends was 
as of march   the effective rate of preferred dividends was 
the dividend rate will increase to a cap of effective july  the company is limited in the payment of preferred stock dividends by the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant in the company s amended and restated credit agreement 
in addition  the company has made the decision to make its investments in its vessels before applying cash to pay preferred stock dividends 
under the terms of the preferred stock  upon the conversion of the preferred stock to common stock  a subordinated promissory note will be issued whereby the cash dividends will accrue at the rates set for the preferred stock and the note must be paid at the earlier of the second anniversary of the conversion or seven years from the initial issuance date of the preferred stock 
investments in capital expenditures and drydockings we incurred million in paid and unpaid capital expenditures and drydock expenses during the fiscal year ended march   including relating to carryover from the winter season  compared to million  including a carryover of million from the winter season  in the fiscal year ended march  the company completed the conversion of its last steam powered vessel  the ss michipicoten  to diesel power in april  and the vessel is now fully operational 
the company took the vessel out of service in december this project has cost approximately million 
the benefits of the conversion include increased revenues from higher speeds and lower costs from reduced fuel consumption  labor  maintenance and other operating expenses 
on february   black creek acquired two integrated tug and barge units for consideration consisting of i million cash paid at closing  ii million cash to be paid by black creek holdings in monthly installments of beginning on april   iii a promissory note of black creek holdings in the principal amount of million  and iv  shares of the company s common stock 
foreign exchange rate risk we have foreign currency exposure related to the currency related translation of various financial instruments denominated in the canadian dollar fair value risk and operating cash flows denominated in the canadian dollar cash flow risk 
these exposures are associated with period to period changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar 
at march   our liability for financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately cdn million of term borrowings in canada and there was no balance of revolving borrowings in canada 
although we have tried to match our indebtedness and cash flows from earnings by country  a sudden increase in the canadian dollar exchange rates could increase the indebtedness converted to us dollars before operating cash flows can make up for such a currency conversion change 

table of contents from a cash flow perspective  our operations are insulated against changes in currency rates as operations in canada and the united states have revenues and expenditures denominated in local currencies and our operations are cash flow positive 
however  as stated above  the majority of our financial liabilities are denominated in canadian dollars which exposes us to currency risks related to principal payments and interest payments on such financial liability instruments 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates associated with revolving our indebtedness under our amended and restated credit agreement  which carries interest rates which vary with canadian prime rates and ba rates for canadian borrowings  and us prime rates and libor rates on us borrowings 
we entered into two interest rate swap contracts for approximately of our combined lower lakes and black creek term loans for the remaining term of such loans based on three month ba rates for the canadian term loans and three month us libor rates for the us term loans 
the rates on these instruments  prior to the addition of the lender s margin  are on the canadian term loans  and on the us term loans 
we will be exposed to interest rate risk under our interest rate swap contracts if such contracts are required to be amended or terminated earlier than their termination dates 
off balance sheet arrangements on august   in connection with the entry into a contract of affreightment with voyageur maritime transport limited voyageur and voyageur maritime trading inc vmt and an option agreement with vmt  lower lakes towing entered into a guarantee the guarantee with ge canada finance holding company ge canada  pursuant to which lower lakes towing agreed to guarantee up to cdn million the guaranteed obligations of voyageur indebtedness to ge canada  with lower lakes towing s obligations becoming due and payable should voyageur fail to meet certain financial covenants under the terms of its loan from ge canada or if voyageur breached certain of its obligations under the coa 
lower lakes towing s maximum future payments under the guarantee were limited to the guaranteed obligations plus the costs and expenses ge canada incurred while enforcing its rights under the guarantee 
lower lakes secured its obligations under the guarantee with a letter of credit the letter of credit issued under the amended and restated credit agreement 
lower lakes towing had several options available to it in the event that ge canada intended to draw under the guarantee  including i the right to exercise its option for the trader under the option agreement and ii the right to make a subordinated secured loan to voyageur in an amount at least equal to the amount intended to be drawn by ge canada on terms as were reasonably satisfactory to ge canada and voyageur 
in connection with the guarantee  as of march  we have recorded a loss contingency of million on lower lakes towing s guarantee of voyageur s indebtedness with ge canada  following the maritime trader s placement in receivership as of march  we believe that the fair value of the maritime trader  which requires drydocking and steel renewal investments  is less than the estimated value of ge canada s total claim by at least the amount of lower lakes towing s cdn million guarantee 
due to voyageur s failure to meet its obligations under its financing arrangements with ge canada  on may   general electric capital corporation delivered a notice to lower lakes that effective as of may   ge canada had drawn the full amount available under the letter of credit  with the cdn million added to lower lakes revolving borrowings under the amended and restated credit agreement 
additionally  on march   ge canada placed the trader into receivership in accordance with the laws of ontario and accordingly  lower lakes no longer has access to this vessel 
voyageur was previously determined to be a variable interest entity of the company under us gaap 
we believe that voyageur ceased to be a vie of the company when ge canada seized the trader pursuant to ontario law and placed the subsidiary that owns the trader under liquidation in the federal court of canada effective march  due to voyageur s failure to pay principal and interest due to ge canada in february we were never the primary beneficiary of voyageur  and did not receive any material margin for the shipments made on the trader  since the relationship was an industry standard charter relationship 
the company provided no loan support or liquidity to voyageur during the fiscal year ended march  lack of historical operating data for acquired vessels from time to time  as opportunities arise and depending on the availability of financing  we may acquire additional secondhand drybulk carriers 
consistent with shipping industry practice  other than inspection of the physical condition of the vessels and examinations of classification society records  there is typically no historical financial due diligence process conducted when we acquire vessels 
accordingly  in such circumstances  we do not obtain the historical operating data for the vessels from the sellers because that information is not material to our decision to make vessel acquisitions  nor do we believe it would be helpful to potential investors in our stock in assessing our business or profitability 

table of contents consistent with shipping industry practice  we generally treat the acquisition of a vessel as the acquisition of an asset rather than a business 
in cases where a vessel services a contract of affreightment with a third party customer and the buyer desires to acquire such contract  the seller generally cannot transfer the contract to the buyer without the customer s consent 
the purchase of a vessel itself typically does not transfer the contracts of affreightment serviced by such vessel because such contracts are separate service agreements between the vessel owner and its customers 
where we identify any intangible assets or liabilities associated with the acquisition of a vessel  we allocate the purchase price of acquired tangible and intangible assets based on their relative fair values 
when we purchase a vessel and assume or renegotiate contracts of affreightment associated with the vessel  we must take the following steps before the vessel will be ready to commence operations obtain the customer s consent to us as the new owner if applicable  arrange for a new crew for the vessel  replace all hired equipment on board  such as gas cylinders and communication equipment  negotiate and enter into new insurance contracts for the vessel through our own insurance brokers  and implement a new planned maintenance program for the vessel 
the following discussion is intended to provide an understanding of how acquisitions of vessels affect our business and results of operations 
our business is comprised of the following main elements employment and operation of our drybulk vessels  scheduling our vessels to satisfy customer s contracts of affreightment  and management of the financial  general and administrative elements involved in the conduct of our business and ownership of our drybulk vessels

critical accounting policies rand s significant accounting policies are presented in note to its audited consolidated financial statements  and the following summaries should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report on form k 
while all accounting policies affect the financial statements  certain policies may be viewed as critical 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the application of certain accounting policies  many of which require the company to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in the financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition the company generates revenues from freight billings under contracts of affreightment voyage charters generally on a rate per ton basis based on origin destination and cargo carried 
voyage revenue is recognized ratably over the duration of a voyage based on the relative transit time in each reporting period when the following conditions are met the company has a signed contract of affreightment  the contract price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
included in freight billings are other fees such as fuel surcharges and other freight surcharges  which represent pass through charges to customers for toll fees  lockage fees and ice breaking fees paid to other parties 
fuel surcharges are recognized over the duration of the voyage  while freight surcharges are recognized when the associated costs are incurred 
freight surcharges are less than of total revenue 
the company subcontracts excess customer demand to other freight providers 
service to customers under such arrangements is transparent to the customer and no additional services are provided to customers 
consequently  revenues recognized for customers serviced by freight subcontractors are recognized on the same basis as described above 
costs for subcontracted freight providers  presented as outside voyage charter fees on the consolidated statement of operations are recognized as incurred and are thereby recognized ratably over the voyage 
in addition  all revenues are presented on a gross basis 
vessel acquisitions vessels are stated at cost  which consists of the purchase price and any material expenses incurred upon acquisition  such as initial repairs  improvements  delivery expenses and other expenditures to prepare the vessel for its initial voyage 
subsequent expenditures for conversions and major improvements are capitalized when they appreciably extend the life  increase the earnings capacity or improve the efficiency or safety of the vessels 
significant financing costs incurred during the construction period of the vessels are also capitalized and included in the vessels cost 
otherwise these amounts are charged to expense as incurred 
intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill  financing costs  trademarks  trade names and customer relationships and contracts 
other intangibles are amortized as follows trademarks and trade names years straight line customer relationships and contracts years straight line although customer contracts have a typical duration of only three to five years  the company has experienced a consistent track record of serial renewals by its significant contract customers and such customers comprise most of the company s business 
the company s customer relationships are fortified by the fact that there are a limited number of great lakes shipping companies as well as a declining number of vessels operating on the great lakes 
the company has an additional advantage in that it operates half of the vessels on the great lakes which are classified as river class vessels and capable of accessing docks and customers not accessible to larger vessels 
accordingly  customers have a substantial interest in protecting their great lakes transportation relationships 
based on the foregoing  and in compliance with sfas  the company has determined that years is the most appropriate best estimate amortization period for its customer relationships and contracts 
the company has estimated a year useful life for its trademarks and trade names 
in accordance with asc determining the life of an intangible asset  since the company cannot reliably determine the pattern of economic benefit of the use of the customer relationships and trademarks and trade names  the company has determined that the straight line amortization is appropriate 
deferred financing costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the related debt  which approximates the effective interest method 

table of contents impairment of fixed assets and intangible assets with finite lives fixed assets and finite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when a triggering event occurs 
examples of such triggering events include a significant disposal of a portion of such assets  an adverse change in the market involving the business employing the related assets  a significant decrease in the benefits realized from an acquired business  difficulties or delays in integrating the business  and a significant change in the operations of an acquired business 
the company has determined that there were no adverse changes in our markets or other triggering events that could affect the valuation of our assets during the fiscal year ended march  impairment of goodwill as of march   the company made its annual test of goodwill 
significant assumptions are inherent in this process  including estimates of our undiscounted cash flows  discount rates  comparable companies and comparable transactions 
discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the respective intangible assets 
the company presently has no intangible assets not subject to amortization other than goodwill 
the fair market values of each of our reporting units exceeded the sum of the carrying values of those reporting units at march  income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc income taxes which requires the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of tax assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is recognized  if necessary  to measure tax benefits to the extent that  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that they will be realized 
the determination to set up a valuation allowance is dependent on management s estimates of whether taxable income in future periods for each taxable entity is sufficient that deferred income tax assets will be realized  except for the change in foreign exchange loss  based on the performance of the entity and the expected timing of the reversal of the deferred tax liabilities  and tax net operating losses in particular entities in recent years 
such management estimates are subject to uncertainty 
the company has adopted the accounting guidance related to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes effective april  which addresses the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under such guidance  the company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
establishing accruals for tax benefits requires management to make estimates and assessments with respect to the ultimate outcome of tax audit issues if any and amounts recorded on financial statements 
the ultimate resolution of such uncertain tax benefits may differ from management s estimate  potentially impacting the company s results of operations  cash flows  or financial position 
however  the impact of the company s reassessment of its tax positions did not have a material effect on the results of operations  financial condition or liquidity
