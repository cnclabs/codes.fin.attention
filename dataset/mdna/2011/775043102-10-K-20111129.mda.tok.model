currency exchange rate fluctuations although the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in us dollars  approximately of its net sales are denominated in other currencies  primarily the euro  swedish krona  swiss francs  british pound  singapore dollar  taiwanese dollar  korean won  japanese yen  canadian dollar  and chinese rmb 
net sales and costs and related assets and liabilities are generally denominated in the functional currencies of the operations  thereby serving to reduce the company s exposure to exchange gains and losses 
exchange differences upon translation from each operation s functional currency to us dollars are accumulated as a separate component of equity 
the currency translation adjustment component of shareholders equity had the effect of increasing total equity by million at september   as compared to million at september  the fluctuation of the euro and the other relevant functional currencies against the us dollar has had the effect of increasing or decreasing as applicable reported net sales  as well as cost of goods sold  gross margin  selling  general and administrative expenses  and research and development expenses  denominated in such foreign currencies when translated into us dollars as compared to prior periods 
the company defines the term constant currency to mean that financial data for a period are translated into us dollars using the same foreign currency exchange rates that were used to translate financial data for the previously reported period 
changes in sales  gross profit  and income from operations include the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company management reviews and analyzes business results on a constant currency basis and believes these results represent the company underlying business trends without distortion due to currency fluctuations 
the company believes that this constant currency financial information is a useful measure for investors because it reflects actual changes in operations 
the following chart compares our net sales  gross profit  and income from operations for each of fiscal years   and  to the equivalent financial results calculated on a constant currency basis 
because this constant currency financial information does not conform to generally accepted accounting principles  it is presented under the caption non gaap constant currency fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year gaap actual non gaap constant currency gaap actual non gaap constant currency gaap actual non gaap constant currency in millions net sales gross profit income from operations between fiscal year and  the average exchange rate for the euro strengthened against the us dollar by approximately

critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are also described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of the accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records allowances for uncollectible customer accounts receivable based on historical experience 
additionally  an allowance is made based on an assessment of specific customers financial condition and liquidity 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
no individual customer represents more than of total accounts receivable 
any increase in allowance will impact operating income during a given period 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  after provisions for excess and obsolete inventory salable at prices below cost 
provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventories are provided based on current assessments about historical experience and future product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
these factors are impacted by market conditions  technology changes  and changes in strategic direction  and require estimates and management judgment that may include elements that are uncertain 
the company evaluates the adequacy of these provisions quarterly 
although the company strives to achieve a balance between market demands and risk of inventory excess or obsolescence  it is possible that  should conditions change  additional provisions may be needed 
any changes in provisions will impact operating income during a given period 
warranty reserves the company provides reserves for the estimated costs of product warranties when revenue is recognized 
the company relies upon historical experience  expectations of future conditions  and its service data to estimate its warranty reserve 
the company continuously monitors this data to ensure that the reserve is sufficient 
warranty costs have historically been within our expectations 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims such costs may include material  labor  and travel costs  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
increases in reserves will impact operating income during the period 
pension obligations the determination of the company s obligation and expense for pension is dependent on the selection of certain actuarial assumptions in calculating those amounts 
assumptions are made about interest rates  expected investment return on plan assets  total turnover rates  and rates of future compensation increases 
in addition  the company provides the actuarial consultants with subjective factors such as withdrawal rates and mortality rates to develop their calculations of these amounts 
the company generally reviews these assumptions at the beginning of each fiscal year 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
the actuarial assumptions that the company uses may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact on the amount of pension benefits expense the company has recorded or may record 
the discount rate enables the company to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
the company has little latitude in selecting this rate and it must represent the market rate of high quality fixed income investments 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the company considers the current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets 
income taxes we estimate our income tax provision in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  a process that includes estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities 
we must also make judgments regarding the ability to realize the deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets that we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria 
we assess whether an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return meets the threshold for recognition and measurement in the consolidated financial statements 
our judgments regarding future taxable income as well as tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return may change due to changes in market conditions  changes in tax laws or other factors 
if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future  the valuation allowances and or tax reserves established may be increased or decreased  resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense 
share based payment stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employee requisite vesting period 
we make judgments about the fair value of the awards  including the expected term of the award  volatility of the underlying stock and estimated forfeitures  which impact the amount of compensation expense recognized in the financial statements 
such amounts may change as a result of additional grants  forfeitures  modifications in assumptions and other factors 
the income tax effects of share based payments are recognized in the financial statements for those awards which will normally result in tax deductions under existing tax law 
under current us federal tax laws  we receive a compensation expense deduction related to stock options only when those options are exercised and vested shares are received 
accordingly  the financial statement recognition of compensation cost for stock options creates a deductible temporary difference which results in a deferred tax asset and a corresponding deferred tax benefit in the income statement for all us based employees 
stock compensation expense related to non us employees is treated as a permanent difference for income tax purposes 
recent accounting pronouncements adopted in july  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued asu no
