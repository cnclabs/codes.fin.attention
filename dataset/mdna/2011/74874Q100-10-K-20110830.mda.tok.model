management overview quinstreet is a leader in vertical marketing and media online 
we have built a strong set of capabilities to engage internet visitors with targeted media and to connect our marketing clients with their potential customers online 
we focus on serving clients in large  information intensive industry verticals where relevant  targeted media and offerings help visitors make informed choices  find the products that match their needs  and thus become qualified customer prospects for our clients 
we deliver cost effective marketing results to our clients most typically in the form of a qualified lead or inquiry  or in the form of a click 
these leads or clicks can then convert into a customer or sale for clients at a rate that results in an acceptable marketing cost to them 
we are typically paid by clients when we deliver qualified leads or clicks as defined by our agreements with them 
because we bear the costs of media  our programs must deliver value to our clients and provide for a media yield  or our ability to generate an acceptable margin on our media costs  that provides a sound financial outcome for us 
our general process is we own or access targeted media  we run advertisements or other forms of marketing messages and programs in that media to create visitor responses or clicks through to client offerings  we match these responses or clicks to client offerings that meet visitor interests or needs  converting visitors into qualified leads or clicks  and we optimize client matches and media yield such that we achieve desired results for clients and a sound financial outcome for us 
our primary financial objective has been and remains creating revenue growth from sustainable sources  at target levels of profitability 
our primary financial objective is not to maximize profits  but rather to achieve target levels of profitability while investing in various growth initiatives  as we believe we are in the early stages of a large  long term market 
our direct marketing services  or dms  business accounted for substantially all of our net revenue in fiscal years  and our dms business derives its net revenue from fees earned through the delivery of qualified leads and clicks and  to a lesser extent  display advertisement  or impressions 
through a vertical focus  
table of contents targeted media presence and our technology platform  we are able to deliver targeted  measurable marketing results to our clients 
our two largest client verticals are financial services and education 
our financial services client vertical represented  and of net revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
our education client vertical represented  and of net revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
other dms client verticals  consisting primarily of home services  business to business  or bb  and medical  represented   and of net revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
in addition  we derived less than of our net revenue in fiscal year and in fiscal years and from our direct selling services  or dss  business 
we generated substantially all of our revenue from sales to clients in the united states 
trends affecting our business client verticals to date  we have generated the majority of our revenue from clients in our financial services and education client verticals 
we expect that a majority of our revenue in fiscal year will be generated from clients in these two client verticals 
our education client vertical is affected by a number of factors  including most importantly uncertainty from the adoption of the new regulations of for profit financial institutions 
the uncertainty and the regulations may affect our clients businesses and marketing practices and may result in fluctuations in the volume and mix of our business with these clients 
our financial services client vertical has been negatively affected by pricing pressure 
prices in the click business of our financial services client vertical are determined by bidding 
changes in volume of one or more bidders can dynamically impact pricing for all clients 
recently  revenue in our financial services client vertical has been negatively affected by the pricing impact from volume reductions by certain clients

during fiscal year  in addition to the acquisition of cardratings  we acquired other online publishing businesses 
our acquisition strategy may result in significant fluctuations in our available working capital from period to period and over the years 
we may use cash  stock or promissory notes to acquire various businesses or technologies  and we cannot accurately predict the timing of those acquisitions or the impact on our cash flows and balance sheet 
large acquisitions or multiple acquisitions within a particular period may significantly affect our financial results for that period 
we may utilize debt financing to make acquisitions  which could give rise to higher interest expense and more restrictive operating covenants 
we may also utilize our stock as consideration  which could result in substantial dilution 
development and acquisition of targeted media one of the primary challenges of our business is finding or creating media that is targeted enough to attract prospects economically for our clients and at costs that work for our business model 
in order to continue to grow our business  we must be able to continue to find or develop quality targeted media on a cost effective basis 
our inability to find or develop high quality targeted media could impair our growth or adversely affect our financial performance 
seasonality our results are subject to significant fluctuation as a result of seasonality 
in particular  our quarters ending december our second fiscal quarter typically demonstrate seasonal weakness 
in our second fiscal quarters  there is lower availability of lead supply from some forms of media during the holiday period on a cost effective basis and some of our clients request fewer leads due to holiday staffing 
in our quarters ending march our third fiscal quarter  this trend generally reverses with better lead availability and often new budgets at the beginning of the year for our clients with fiscal years ending december basis of presentation general we operate in two segments dms and dss

selected quarterly financial data the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations data for the eight quarters ended june  we have prepared the statements of operations for each of these quarters on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and  in the opinion of the management  each statement of operations includes all adjustments  consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for the fair statement of the results of operations for these periods 
this information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included

adjusted ebitda our use of adjusted ebitda 
we include adjusted ebitda in this report because i we seek to manage our business to a consistent level of adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net revenue  ii it is a key basis upon which our management assesses our operating performance  iii it is one of the primary metrics investors use in evaluating internet marketing companies  iv it is a factor in the evaluation of the performance of our management in determining compensation  and v it is an element of certain financial covenants under our debt agreements 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income less provision for taxes  depreciation expense  amortization expense  stock based compensation expense  interest and other income expense  net 
we use adjusted ebitda as a key performance measure because we believe it facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures affecting interest expense  tax positions such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or fluctuations in permanent differences or discrete quarterly items and the non cash impact of depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation expense 
because adjusted ebitda facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis  we also use adjusted ebitda for business planning purposes  to incentivize and compensate our management personnel and in evaluating acquisition opportunities 
in addition  we believe adjusted ebitda and similar measures are widely used by investors  securities analysts  ratings agencies and other interested parties in our industry as a measure of financial performance and debt service capabilities 
our use of adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures for capital equipment or other contractual commitments  
table of contents although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements  adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  adjusted ebitda does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of issuing stock based compensation to our management team and employees  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness  adjusted ebitda does not reflect certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us  and other companies  including companies in our industry  may calculate adjusted ebitda measures differently  which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of these limitations  adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business 
when evaluating our performance  adjusted ebitda should be considered alongside other financial performance measures  including various cash flow metrics  net income and our other gaap results 
the following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income  the most comparable gaap measure  for each of the periods indicated three months ended june  mar  dec  sept  june  mar  dec  sept  in thousands net income interest and other income expense  net provision for taxes depreciation and amortization stock based compensation expense adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda quarterly trends 
we seek to manage our business to a consistent level of adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net revenue 
we do so on a fiscal year basis by varying our operations to balance revenue growth and costs throughout the fiscal year 
we do not seek to manage our business to a consistent level of adjusted ebitda on a quarterly basis and investors should expect our adjusted ebitda margins to vary from quarter to quarter 
for quarterly periods ending from september  to june   adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenue was    and   and  respectively 
in general  adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenue tends to be seasonally weaker in the quarter ending december  and stronger in quarters ending march and june liquidity and capital resources our primary operating cash requirements include the payment of media costs  personnel costs  costs of information technology systems and office facilities 
our principal sources of liquidity as of june   consisted of cash and cash equivalents of million  short term marketable securities of million  and our credit facility which had million available for borrowing 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  short term marketable securities  available borrowings under the credit facility and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next months

table of contents in connection with the acquisition of surehits and contingent upon the achievement of specified financial targets we may be required to make an earn out payment of million in january of credit facility in january  we replaced our existing credit facility with a credit facility totaling million 
the new facility consisted of a million four year term loan  with principal amortization of   and annually  and a million four year revolving credit line with an option to increase the revolving credit line by million

the interest rate varies dependent upon the ratio of funded debt to adjusted ebitda and ranges from libor to or prime to for the revolving credit line and from libor to or prime to for the term loan 
adjusted ebitda is defined as net income less provision for taxes  depreciation expense  amortization expense  stock based compensation expense  interest and other income expense  net and acquisition costs for business combinations

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
in doing so  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
some of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events 
we base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience or on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
we believe that the critical accounting policies listed below involve our more significant judgments  estimates and assumptions and  therefore  could have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we believe that a discussion of these policies is necessary to understand and evaluate the consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
for further information on our critical and other significant accounting policies  see note of our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue from two sources direct marketing services dms and direct selling services dss 
dms revenue is derived primarily from fees which are earned through the delivery of qualified leads or clicks and  to a lesser extent  display advertisements  or impressions 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
delivery is deemed to have occurred at the time a qualified lead or click is delivered to the client provided that no significant obligations remain 
on july   as required under gaap  we adopted the amended accounting guidance for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements which provides guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated  and how the consideration should be allocated 
the adoption of this amended guidance did not have a significant impact on our revenue recognition for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the guidance requires the allocation of revenue in an arrangement using the estimated selling price esp of deliverables if vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price based on historical stand alone sales or third party evidence tpe of selling price do not exist 
due to the unique nature of some of our multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  we may not be able to establish selling prices based on historical stand alone sales or third party evidence  therefore we may use our best estimate to establish selling prices for these arrangements under the new standard 
we establish best estimates within a range of selling prices considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  factors such as class of client  size of transaction  available media inventory  pricing strategies and market conditions 
we believe the use of the best estimate of selling price allows revenue recognition in a manner consistent with the underlying economics of the transaction 
from time to time  we may agree to credit a client for certain leads or clicks if they fail to meet the contractual or other guidelines of a particular client 
we have established a sales reserve based on historical experience 
to date  such credits have been immaterial and within our expectations 
for a portion of our revenue  we have agreements with providers of online media or traffic publishers used in the generation of qualified leads or clicks 
we receive a fee from our clients and pay a fee to publishers either on a revenue share  cost per lead  cost per click or cost per thousand impressions basis 
we are the primary obligor in the transaction 
as a result  the fees paid by our clients are recognized as revenue and the fees paid to our publishers are included in cost of revenue 
dss revenue comprises i set up and professional services fees and ii usage fees 
set up and professional service fees that do not provide stand alone value to a client are recognized over the contractual term of the agreement or the expected client relationship period  whichever is longer  effective when the application reaches the 
table of contents go live date 
we define the go live date as the date when the application enters into a production environment or all essential functionalities have been delivered 
usage fees are recognized on a monthly basis as earned 
deferred revenue is comprised of contractual billings in excess of recognized revenue and payments received in advance of revenue recognition 
stock based compensation we measure and record the expense related to stock based transactions based on the fair values of the awards as determined on the date of grant 
for stock options  we selected the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value 
in applying the black scholes option pricing model  our determination of fair value is affected by assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the stock options and the employees actual and projected stock option exercise and pre vesting employment termination behaviors 
the fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
we recognize stock based compensation expense over the requisite service period using the straight line method  based on awards ultimately expected to vest 
we estimate future forfeitures at the date of grant and revise the estimates  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
the application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  the assignment of assets  liabilities and goodwill to reporting units and the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows and determining appropriate discount rates  growth rates and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value which could trigger impairment 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test in our quarter ending june  we concluded that dms and dss constitute two separate reporting units 
we determined the fair value of our dms reporting unit by adjusting the fair value of the business enterprise based on our market capitalization for the fair value of the dss reporting unit 
the fair value of our dss reporting unit was estimated using the income approach 
under the income approach  we calculated the fair value of our dss reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
our assessment indicated that the estimated fair value of our dms reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value while the estimated fair value of our dss reporting unit approximated its carrying value 
the carrying value of our dss reporting unit includes allocated goodwill of million which represents less than of our total goodwill balance 
no impairment charges were recorded in the periods presented 
the fair value of the reporting units and hence the valuation of goodwill could be affected if actual results differ substantially from our estimates 
circumstances that could affect the valuation of goodwill include  among other things  a significant change in our market capitalization  the business climate and buying habits of our subscriber base  and with respect to the dss reporting unit  the loss of a significant customer 
long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets  such as property and equipment and purchased intangible assets with finite lives  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we apply judgment when estimating the fair value of the assets based on the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate and recognize an impairment loss if estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset  if any  are less than the carrying value of the asset 
no impairment charges were recorded in the periods presented 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach to record deferred taxes 
our deferred income tax assets represent temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities that will result in deductible amounts in future years  including net operating loss carry forwards 
based on estimates  the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements for information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business 
these risks include primarily foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks 
foreign currency exchange risk to date  our international client agreements have been predominately denominated in us dollars  and accordingly  we have limited exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to client agreements and do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions 
as the local accounts for some of our foreign operations are maintained in the local currency of the respective country  we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations associated with the remeasurement to us dollars 
a hypothetical change of in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
interest rate risk we invest our cash equivalents and short term investments primarily in money market funds  us government securities and short term deposits with original maturities of less than twelve months 
the investments are held for working capital purposes and acquisition financing 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we believe that we do not have material exposure to changes in the fair value as a result of changes in interest rates due to the short term nature of our investments 
declines in interest rates may reduce future investment income 
however  a hypothetical decline of in the interest rate on our investments would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
our credit facility had a borrowing capacity of million 
interest on borrowings under the credit facility is based at specified margins above either libor or the prime rate 
our exposure to interest rate risk under the credit facility will depend on the extent to which we utilize such facility 
as of june   we had million outstanding under our credit facility 
a hypothetical increase of in the libor or prime rate based interest rate on our credit facility would result in an increase in our interest expense of million per year  assuming constant borrowing levels
