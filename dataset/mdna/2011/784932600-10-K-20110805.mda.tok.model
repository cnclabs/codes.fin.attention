table of contents introduction management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to provide readers with an understanding of saba 
the following sections are included in our md a overview  critical accounting policies  results of operations  and liquidity and capital resources 
overview general we are the premier provider of a new class of learning and talent management solutions providing a unified set of people cloud applications that include enterprise learning  talent management  testing and assessment and collaboration solutions delivered through the saba people cloud 
today s people driven enterprises are using our solutions to mobilize and engage people around new strategies and initiatives  align and connect people to accelerate the flow of business  and cultivate  capture  and share individual and collective knowhow to effectively compete and succeed 
we enable organizations to build a transformative workplace where they can leverage their people networks to become more competitive through innovation  speed  agility  and trust 
the saba people cloud consists of a full suite of integrated people cloud applications  an open  flexible  service oriented architecture  a world class multi tenant people cloud infrastructure  and a vast people cloud community of human capital experts  partners  practitioners and thought leaders 
the saba people cloud enables organizations to transform the way they develop  engage and inspire their people network of employees  partners and customers  to achieve sustainable competitive advantage and high impact performance 
background we commenced operations in april and  through march  focused substantially all of our efforts on research activities  developing our products and building our business infrastructure 
we shipped our first saba enterprise learning products and began to generate revenues from software license fees  implementation and consulting services fees and support fees in april commencing in fiscal  we experienced an accelerated shift toward increased customer adoption of saas transactions from perpetual licenses 
to further accelerate the transition  in july  we announced a strategy to offer new customers solely cloud based subscriptions to our products 
assuming this strategy is successful  we expect that the increased adoption of saas by our customers will lead to greater predictability in our quarterly revenue and our results of operations 
however  the shift from software licenses has had an impact on our total revenue and results of operations during the last few quarters in part because we recognize revenues from saas over the term of the subscription agreement whereas revenue from a software license sale is generally recognized in the period in which the software arrangement is completed and the software is delivered to the customer 
our corporate headquarters are located in redwood shores  california 
we have an international presence in australia  brazil  canada  france  germany  india  japan and the united kingdom through which we conduct various operating activities related to our business 
in each of the non us jurisdictions in which we have subsidiaries  other than india  we have employees or consultants engaged in sales and services activities 
in the case of our india subsidiary  our employees primarily engage in software development and quality assurance testing activities 
sources of revenue we generate revenues from the sale of subscription services  software licenses and professional services 

table of contents subscription services subscription revenue includes revenue from delivery of our products in the cloud and revenue from license updates and product support 
customers that desire to access our products in the cloud generally sign subscription agreements with terms typically ranging from one to three years 
license updates and product support include the right to receive future unspecified updates for the applicable software product and technical support 
we typically sell license updates and product support for an initial period of one year concurrently with the sale of the related software license 
after the initial period  license updates and product support is renewable on an annual basis at the option of the customer 
our subscription revenue depends upon both our sales of additional subscription services and renewals of existing agreements 
we believe that subscription revenue will grow steadily for the foreseeable future as we anticipate that the majority of our customers will renew their annual contracts and we will continue to add new subscription customers 
software licenses although we expect that our new customers will primarily purchase our products in the cloud on a software as a service basis  we will continue to license our products on a limited basis primarily to existing customers 
when we license our software  it is included in multiple element arrangement that includes a combination of our software  license updates and product support and or professional services 
a significant amount of our license sales are for perpetual licenses 
our license revenue is affected by  among other things  the strength of general economic and business conditions  as well as customers budgetary cycles and the competitive position of our software products 
in addition  the sales cycle for our products is typically six to twelve months 
the timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenue 
professional services our professional services business consists of consulting and education services 
consulting and education services are typically provided to customers that have purchased our products directly from us 
these consulting and education services are generally provided over a period of three to nine months after the product purchase 
accordingly  our consulting and education services revenue varies directly with the levels of new product bookings generated from our direct sales organization in the preceding three to nine month period 
in addition  our consulting and education services revenue varies following our commercial release of significant software updates as our license customers may engage our services to assist with the implementation of their software update 
we provide consulting services on a time and materials basis and on a fixed fee basis 
generally  consulting services related to software implementation are not considered essential to the functionality of the software 
impact of adoption prior to adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards update no 
revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu  our professional services  when sold with cloud based offerings  did not qualify as separate units of accounting and were recognized as revenue ratably over the longest subscription period in the arrangement 
under subscription accounting  we also deferred the associated professional services costs and recognized them on a straight line basis over the same subscription period 
this resulted in the deferral of professional services revenue and professional services cost of revenue 
with the adoption of asu  arrangement consideration is allocated using the relative selling price method and recognized as individual deliverables in accordance with the guidance described in the critical accounting policies 
additionally  we expense the direct cost related to the professional services as incurred 

table of contents total revenues for the year ended may  were million with the adoption of asu if we did not elect an early adoption of asu  our total revenues would have been million for the year ended may  the increase in total revenues was primarily due to an increase of million in professional services revenue that we recognized based on the adoption of asu cost of revenues for the year ended may  was million with the adoption of asu cost of revenues would have been million for the year ended may  had we not adopted asu the increase in cost of revenues was the result of expensing direct costs related to the professional services as incurred 
as of may   our deferred revenue was million 
our deferred revenue would have been million had we not adopted asu the impact of our adoption of asu will vary  in the future  based on the nature and volume of new or materially modified arrangements 
cost of revenue our cost of revenue primarily consists of compensation  employee benefits and out of pocket travel related expenses for our employees  and the fees of third party subcontractors  who provide professional services 
cost of revenue also includes external hosting fees and depreciation and amortization charges related to the infrastructure required to deliver our products in the cloud  third party license royalty costs  overhead allocated based on headcount and reimbursed expenses 
the amortization of acquired developed technology  which is comprised of the ratable amortization of technological assets acquired in acquisitions  is also included in the cost of revenue 
many factors affect our cost of revenue  including changes in the mix of products and services  pricing trends and changes in the amount of reimbursed expenses 
because cost as a percentage of revenues is higher for services than for software licenses  an increase in services  including subscription services  as a percentage of our total revenue would reduce gross profit as a percentage of total revenue 
we classify deferred revenue and deferred costs on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as current if we expect to recognize such revenue or cost within the following twelve months 
as of may   the deferred balance of the professional services revenue related to such subscription offerings and the related deferred costs was million and million  respectively  related to contracts that were entered into prior to adoption of asu and deferred revenue and deferred costs related to contracts that were entered into prior to june  continue to be recognized and amortized ratably over the subscription period provided that such contracts were not subsequently modified 
operating expenses we classify all operating expenses  except amortization of purchased intangible assets and restructuring  to the research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expense categories based on the nature of the expenses 
each of these three categories includes commonly recurring expenses such as salaries including stock based compensation  employee benefits  travel and entertainment costs  and allocated communication  rent and depreciation costs 
we allocate communication  rent and depreciation costs to each of the functional areas that derive a benefit from such costs based upon their respective headcounts 
the sales and marketing category of operating expenses also includes sales commissions and expenses related to public relations and advertising  trade shows and marketing collateral materials 
the general and administrative category of operating expenses also includes allowances for doubtful accounts  and administrative and professional services fees 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  we voluntarily changed our accounting policy for sales commissions related to non cancellable annual or multi year saas contracts  from recording an expense when incurred  to deferral and amortization of the sales commission in proportion to the revenue recognized over the 
table of contents non cancellable term of the contract 
all other sales commissions are generally expensed as they are earned per the terms of the sales compensations plans 
we believe this method is preferable because commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non cancellable contracts that they should be deferred and charged to expense over the same period that the related revenue is recognized 
furthermore  the adoption of this accounting policy enhances the comparability of the company s consolidated financial statements by changing to the predominant method utilized in our industry 
for additional discussion related to the sales commission accounting policy change  refer to note of the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap as set forth in the financial accounting standards board s accounting standard codification the codification and consider the various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the sec 
gaap  as set forth within the codification  requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  future events are subject to change and the best estimates and judgments routinely require adjustment 
while a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affect our financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition policies  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and purchased intangible assets  share based payments  income taxes and business combinations 
we have reviewed the critical accounting policies described in the following paragraphs with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition in october  the fasb issued asu which amends the revenue recognition for certain multiple element revenue arrangements excluding license arrangements to provide updated guidance on whether multiple elements exist  how the elements in an arrangement should be separated  and how the arrangement consideration should be allocated to the separate elements  require an entity to allocate arrangement consideration to each element based on a selling price hierarchy  where the selling price for an element is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  if available  third party evidence tpe  if available and if vsoe is not available  or the best estimate of selling price besp  if neither vsoe nor tpe is available  and eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
although the amended standards were not required to be adopted by us until june  the beginning of our fiscal year  we elected to early adopt this accounting guidance retrospectively to the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal for transactions entered into or materially modified after may  we generate revenues from the sale of software licenses  subscription services and professional services and recognize revenues when all of the following conditions are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 

table of contents subscription services arrangements subscription services arrangements generally include a combination of our products delivered via an internet based cloud architecture  and product updates and support related to licenses and professional services 
subscription revenue includes revenue from cloud based offerings and product updates and support related to licenses 
revenue from cloud based offerings that are integrated offerings pursuant to which the customers ability to access our software is not separable from the services necessary to operate the software and customers are not allowed to take possession of our software are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement as delivered 
we do not grant our resellers the right of return and do not recognize revenue from resellers until an end user has been identified and the other conditions of asc are satisfied 
revenue from product updates  support and hosting services related to licenses are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement as delivered or on an as used basis if defined in the contract 
when subscription services arrangements involve multiple elements that qualify as separate units of accounting  we allocate arrangement consideration in multiple deliverable revenue arrangements at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables based on the relative selling price method in accordance with the selling price hierarchy  which includes i vsoe if available  ii tpe if vsoe is not available  and iii besp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
we determine vsoe based on its historical pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately 
in determining vsoe  we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for these services fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range 
we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management  having the relevant authority to do so  for an element not yet sold separately 
when vsoe cannot be established for deliverables in multiple element arrangements  we apply judgment with respect to whether we can establish a selling price based on tpe 
tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately 
generally  our go to market strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of services with similar functionality cannot be obtained 
furthermore  we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor services selling prices are on a stand alone basis 
as a result  we have not been able to establish selling price based on tpe 
when it is unable to establish a selling price using vsoe or tpe  we use besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 
we determine besp for deliverables by considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  prices we charge for similar offerings  market conditions  competitive landscape and pricing practices 
we have not historically priced our cloud based offerings within a narrow range and limited historical renewal rate information is available based on the life cycle of these offerings 
as a result  we use besp in order to allocate the selling price to cloud based deliverables 
in general  we use vsoe in order to allocate the selling price to professional service deliverables 
certain cloud based offerings include arrangements with customers that have separately licensed and taken possession of our software 
when these offerings are part of a multiple element arrangement involving licenses  we recognize revenue in accordance with asc software license arrangements software license arrangements generally include a combination of our software  license updates and product support and or professional services 
a significant amount of our software license arrangements are for perpetual licenses 

table of contents we recognize revenue earned on perpetual software license arrangements in accordance with fasb s asc  software revenue recognition 
when software arrangements involve multiple elements  we recognize license revenue  using the residual method  in accordance with asc under the residual method revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on vsoe of fair value of such undelivered elements and the residual amount of the arrangement is allocated to delivered elements 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenues from perpetual licenses are recognized upon delivery using the residual method 
we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management  having the relevant authority to do so  for an element not yet sold separately 
license revenues from licenses with a term of three years or more are generally recognized on delivery if the other conditions of asc are satisfied 
license revenues from licenses with a term of less than three years are generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
in arrangements where term licenses are bundled with license updates and product support and such revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
we allocate the revenue to license revenue and to license updates and product support revenue based on the vsoe of fair value for license updates and product support revenue on perpetual licenses of similar products 
we do not grant our resellers the right of return and do not recognize revenue from resellers until an end user has been identified and the other conditions of asc are satisfied 
professional services professional services revenues are generally recognized as the services are performed 
although we generally provide professional services on a time and materials basis  certain services agreements are provided on a fixed fee basis 
for services performed on a fixed fee basis  revenues are generally recognized using the proportional performance method  with performance measured based on hours of work performed 
for contracts that involve significant customization and implementation or consulting services that are essential to the functionality of the software  the license and services revenues are recognized using the percentage of completion method or  if we are unable to reliably estimate the costs to complete the services  we use the completed contract method of accounting in accordance with asc and relevant guidance of asc construction type and certain production type 
a contract is considered complete when all significant costs have been incurred or the item has been accepted by the customer 
if the requirements of asc are not met when we bill a customer or a customer pays us  the billed or paid amount is recorded as deferred revenue  which is a liability account 
as the revenue recognition criteria of asc are satisfied  the requisite amounts are recognized as revenue 
we classify deferred revenue and deferred costs on our consolidated balance sheet as current if we expect to recognize such revenue or cost within the following twelve months 
when the revenue from professional services is recognized ratably over the subscription for transactions entered in prior to adoption of asu  we allocate the revenue to professional services revenue and to subscription revenue based on the vsoe of fair value for similar professional services that qualify as a separate element of the arrangement 
our judgment as to whether the consulting services qualify as a separate unit of accounting may materially affect the timing of our revenue recognition and results of operations 
recoverability of goodwill and purchased intangible assets we account for goodwill under asc goodwill 
our goodwill balance at may  and may  was million and million  respectively 
we account for purchased intangible assets under asc general intangibles other than goodwill 
amortization of purchased intangible assets  including acquired developed technology  was million for and million for fiscal and as of may  and may   our purchased intangible assets balance was million and million  net of accumulated amortization 
the total expected future amortization related to purchased intangible assets will be approximately million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 

table of contents asc prescribes a two phase process for impairment testing of goodwill 
the first phase requires us to test for impairment  while the second phase  if necessary  requires us to measure and allocate for the impairment 
we consider saba to be a single reporting unit 
accordingly  all of our goodwill is associated with the entire company 
we perform the required impairment analysis of goodwill annually or on a more frequent basis if indicators of impairment arise or circumstances otherwise dictate 
a significant and extended reduction in our enterprise fair value to below the recorded amount of our stockholders equity could indicate a change in our business climate and under asc  we could be required to write down the carrying value of our goodwill and record an expense for an impairment loss 
in accordance with asc and asc property  plant and equipment  we review our long lived asset groups  including property and equipment and other intangibles  for impairment whenever events indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we did not identify any such indicators in each of the fiscal years ended may   and share based compensation under asc compensation stock compensation  we are required to estimate the awards that we ultimately expect to vest and reduce share based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period 
although  we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience  forfeitures in the future may differ 
the forfeiture rate must be revised if actual forfeitures differ from our original estimates 
we recognize awards granted under the straight line amortization method 
we estimate the fair value of employee stock options using the black scholes merton bsm pricing model 
the fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon united states treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the awards 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock based upon our historical stock price volatility over the length of the expected term of the stock option 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
our expected dividend rate is zero since we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future 
asc requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the tax effected compensation that would have been recognized as if we had always accounted for our stock based award activity under asc to be reported as a cash flow from financing activities  rather than as a cash flow from operating activities 
excess benefits of tax deductions were  and have been recorded for the year ended may  to the extent we change the terms of our employee stock based compensation programs and refine different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from our estimates  the stock based compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded during our fiscal reporting period 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment  segregating foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation  and determining required intercompany revenue sharing  cost reimbursement and other transfer pricing arrangements among related entities 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made 

table of contents we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
our deferred tax assets consist primarily of net operating loss carry forwards and tax credit carryforwards 
in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets  we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located 
we consider future growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
we maintain a full valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets 
a portion of the valuation allowance pertains to deferred tax assets established in connection with prior acquisitions  and to the extent that this portion of the valuation allowance was reversed in fiscal  goodwill was adjusted 
the reversal of the valuation allowance in fiscal year and thereafter  pertaining to deferred tax assets established in connection with such prior acquisitions  would be credited to earnings 
although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable  the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgment that could become subject to audit by tax authorities in the ordinary course of business 
in the event that we were to determine that it is more likely than not that all or part of the net deferred tax assets would be realized  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be credited to earnings in the period in which we made such determination 
if we later determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charges to earnings at such time 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known 
the amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved  audits are closed or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
additionally  the jurisdictions in which our earnings or deductions are realized may differ from our current estimates 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
under asc income taxes  we recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return based on a two step approach 
the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on tax audit assuming that all issues are audited and resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes are considered 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon settlement 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of such matters 
we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit  expiration of statutes of limitation on potential assessments or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made 
our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties 
business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition date fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets  to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable by us  but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and  therefore  actual results may differ from estimates 
as a result  during the measurement period  which may be up to one year from the acquisition date  we 
table of contents may record adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  with the corresponding offset to goodwill 
upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed  whichever comes first  any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of asset acquired and liabilities assumed are estimated using various valuation approaches  which include unobservable inputs that reflect our assessment of the assumptions market participants would use to value such assets and liabilities 
significant inputs to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed include  but are not limited to  discount rates  probability of future cash pay outs related to contingent consideration  and future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists  acquired developed technologies and patents and brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio 
in addition  uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date 
we reevaluate these items quarterly and record any adjustments to our preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period and we continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition 
subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance s or contingency s estimated value  changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations 
results of operations years ended may    and revenues years ended may  percent of total revenues percent of total revenues percent of total revenues dollars in thousands revenues subscription license professional services total revenues total revenues increased by during fiscal year compared to fiscal year and during fiscal year compared to fiscal year in each of fiscal years  and  no single customer represented more than of total revenues 
total revenues during fiscal year were unfavorably impacted by a reduction in license revenue due to the accelerated shift in our business to delivery of our products in the cloud from traditional on premise licenses 
we expect license revenue to continue to decline in fiscal year as we accelerate our transition to a subscription based cloud business 
revenues from customers inside the united states represented approximately of total revenues for fiscal year  of total revenues for fiscal year and of total revenues for fiscal year revenues from customers outside the united states represented approximately of total revenues for fiscal year  of total revenues for fiscal year and of total revenues for fiscal year the only country outside the united states in which revenues from customers represented more than of total revenues was the united kingdom  which represented of total revenues for fiscal year and fiscal year and of total revenues for fiscal year 
table of contents subscription revenue 
subscription revenue increased by million  or  during fiscal year compared to fiscal year the increase reflects an increase of subscription revenue from new customers and an increase in subscription revenue from existing customers  which includes both renewals and subscription for additional products and users 
subscription revenue increased by million  or  during fiscal year compared to fiscal year the increase reflects an increase of subscription revenue from new customers as well as an increase in subscription revenue from existing customers  which included both renewals and subscription for additional products and users 
if we are successful in offering new customers only cloud based offerings  we expect subscription revenue to increase in fiscal year license revenue 
license revenue decreased by million  or  during fiscal year compared to fiscal year the decrease in license revenue reflects our customers growing preference to use our cloud based subscription services rather than purchase perpetual licenses 
license revenue increased million  or  during fiscal year compared to fiscal year the increase in license revenue is due to an increase in license sales to both new and existing customers as well as an increase in license sales of our performance and succession products 
professional services revenue 
professional services revenue increased by million  or  during fiscal year compared to fiscal year the increase was primarily due to an increased demand for our professional services from our expanded customer base 
in addition  fiscal year revenue increased million due to the adoption of asu professional services revenue decreased million  or  during fiscal year compared to fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to the recessionary environment experienced in the prior fiscal year and an increase in sales of professional services for saba products through indirect channels negatively impacting our professional services revenue as services related to these sales are generally provided by our channel partners 
international revenues as a percentage of total revenues and the mix of revenues have varied significantly primarily due to variability in new license sales
