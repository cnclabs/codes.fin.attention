recent economic conditions beginning in september of  the united states and world financial markets came under unprecedented stress 
the immediate impact was a dramatic decrease in liquidity and credit availability throughout the world 
an incredibly rapid and significant deterioration in economic conditions  especially in the united states and europe followed 
these events had an immediate significant adverse impact on the company  including a very dramatic curtailment of new orders  requests to delay deliveries and  in some cases to cancel existing orders 
currently  the market for our products has stabilized but generally remains significantly below normal 
the demand for our military products  although typically cyclical has recently been strong  and recently we have seen certain sectors of the economy appearing to show signs of improving  particularly the energy  and power distribution sectors domestically and certain international markets 
in response to the impact of economic conditions and longer sales cycles  it was determined that swift management action was necessary to ensure that operating activity was balanced with current demand levels 
the actions taken to align our cost structure to current demand levels included headcount reductions  reduction of overtime  suspension of additional hires and merit increases  reduction in executive and salaried pay  bonus and benefits and the introduction of shortened workweeks 
these actions  although difficult  were required to enable the company to adjust to current conditions and position it to respond quickly when the market recovers 
as a result of the aforementioned actions  the company has operated at a profit throughout nevertheless  management continues to closely monitor its costs 
factors affecting revenues and gross profit the company derives most of its revenue from purchase orders from dealers and distributors 
the demand for the company s products depends upon the general economic conditions of the markets in which the company competes 
the company s sales depend in part upon its customers replacement or repair cycles 
adverse economic conditions  including a decrease in commodity prices  may cause customers to forego or postpone new purchases in favor of repairing existing machinery 
additionally  our manitex liftking subsidiary revenues are impacted by the timing of orders received for military forklifts and residential housing starts 
gross profit varies from period to period 
factors that affect gross profit include product mix  production levels and cost of raw materials 
margins tend to increase when production is skewed towards larger capacity cranes  special mission oriented vehicles  specialized carriers and heavy material transporters

the improvement in forklift specialized carrier margin percent was due to restructuring activities that occurred during the second half of and during the first quarter  to a weakening of the canadian dollar  and a favorable product mix the result of increased military business 
schaeff margins were high as part sales accounted for a very significant portion of their revenues 
part sales across all product lines have higher margins 
our crane products gross margin percent for decreased slightly from the prior year less than as our restructuring initiatives and other cost savings measures did not fully offset the effect of a change in mix towards lower tonnage cranes and the decrease in volume 
the decrease in gross profit was partially offset by a decrease of million in operating expenses 

table of contents equipment distribution segment net revenues operating income operating margin financial results for acquisitions are included from the date of acquisition october  for the assets of crane machinery  inc year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues the equipment distribution segment net revenue increased million to million for the year ended december  from million in the prior year 
approximately million of the increase is related to the sale of used construction equipment 
as mention earlier  we expanded our equipment distribution segment in the second quarter of by creating a new division  north american equipment exchange naee  to market previously owned construction and heavy equipment  domestic and internationally 
this division provides a wide range of used lifting and construction equipment of various ages and condition  and the company has the capability to refurbish the equipment to the customers specification 
operating income loss and operating margins operating income of million for the year ended december  was equivalent to of net revenues compared to an operating loss million for the year ended december  or of net revenues 
the change in operating income is due to an increase in revenues from to the gross margin percent  however  decreased between years due to a change in product mix 
part sales  which have significantly higher margins than unit sales  represent a much lower percent of revenues in than in the percentage of revenues related to part sales is much lower because the sales of used construction equipment increased total revenues significantly but did not generate a corresponding increase in part sales 
we did not expect a corresponding increase in part sales as our current part sales business supports a very broad customer base both nationally and internationally 
an increase in operating expenses  associated with increased revenues  in part offsets the increase in gross profit 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues the equipment distribution segment net revenue increased million to million for the year ended december  from million in the prior year 
the increase was the result of being a full year whereas was a three month period as crane was acquired on october  pro forma revenues for assuming the crane acquisition occurred on january  are million 
on a pro forma basis cranes revenues decreased million to million for from million for the dramatic decrease in revues was attributed to the unprecedented stress in the world financial markets that began in september and the significant deterioration in economic conditions  especially in the united states and europe that followed 
as result  the crane s revenues on pro forma basis decreases million  the remaining decrease of million was related decrease in part sales and service revenues 
operating loss income and operating margins the operating loss of million for the year ended december  was equivalent to of net revenues compared to operating income of million for the year ended december  or of net revenues 
the change in operating income was due to a decrease in revenues from to and the fact that operating expense for was for a full year and were only for three months 
the gross margin percent for was higher than it was in  primarily because part sales comprise a much larger percent of total revenues in that they did in part sales have higher margins 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
as of december   the company had approximately million available to borrow under its credit facilities 
in  existing debt including lines of credit  capital lease obligations and the current portion of notes payable and capital lease obligations increased million dollars to million from million at december  the increase in debt is attributed to our two newly formed operations north american equipment exchange and cvs ferrari srl

borrowings were increased in the prior year to fund an increase in sales 
in last year s management s discussion and analysis section of the annual report on form k  we indicated that availability would increase by million during as some very large orders shipped in the fourth quarter and additional large orders were scheduled to ship in the first and second quarter of because our business remained strong throughout  the outstanding borrowing against our canadian credit facility remained elevated 
as such  the availability under the facility only increased by million 
in  existing debt including lines of credit  capital lease obligations and the current portion of notes payable and capital lease obligations increased million dollars to million from million at december  the increase in debt was entirely attributed the badger and load king acquisitions 
in connection with the badger acquisition  the company issued a promissory note for million which was determined to have fair market value of million and entered into a million capital lease for badger facility 
in connection with the load king acquisition  the company issued a promissory note for million which was determined to have fair market value of million 
excluding the new debt associated with the badger and load king acquisition debt  our debt would have decreased by approximately million in the company needs cash to meet its working capital needs as the business grows  to acquire capital equipment  and to fund acquisitions and debt repayment 
we intend to use cash flows from operations and existing availability under the current revolving credit facilities to fund anticipated levels of operations for approximately the next months 
as our availability under our credit lines is limited  it is important that we manage our working capital 
we may need to raise additional capital through debt or equity financings to support our growth strategy  which may include additional acquisitions 
there is no assurance that such financing will be available or  if available  on acceptable terms

the maximum the company may borrow under either facility is the lower of the credit line or the available collateral  as defined in the credit agreements 
collateral under the agreements consists of stated percentages of eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
beginning in september  the financial markets in the united states and globally came under incredible stress 
a substantial deterioration in economic conditions  especially in the united states and europe  followed 
as a result  the company has seen a significant contraction in its business  which is continuing 
this contraction in business generally means that accounts receivable and inventory balances are reduced and the maximum that company can borrow under its revolving credit facilities is also reduced 
the company has implemented significant across the board cost reductions to ensure that operating activity is balanced with current demand levels and to reduce cash requirements to the extent possible and has operated at a profit during the company needs cash to meet its working capital needs as the business grows  to acquire capital equipment  and to fund acquisitions and debt repayment 
since the beginning of the current down turn beginning in september  the company has been able to fund its operations from cash flows and borrowings under its credit facilities 
the company expects cash flows from operations and existing availability under the current revolving credit facilities will be adequate to fund future operations 
management  however  has to continue to ensure that operating activity is balanced with current demand levels 
the length and severity of the current business contraction is not known  we cannot say with certainty that cash generated from operations will be adequate or that the credit facilities will have sufficient availability to bridge any short fall 
the longer the business contraction lasts or the deeper it becomes the greater the risk 

table of contents we will likely need to raise additional capital through debt or equity financings to support our growth strategy  which may include additional acquisitions 
there is no assurance that such financing will be available or  if available  on acceptable terms operating activities generated million of cash for the year ended december   and is comprised of net earnings of million  and non cash items of million offset by an increase in working capital of million 
amortization and depreciation accounts for million or over ninety percent of total non cash items 
the remaining non cash items  none of which are significant  net to million 
the increase in working capital is principally due to increases in accounts receivable and other receivables  inventory and prepaid expense of million  million and million offset by increases in accounts payables and accrued expenses of million and million  respectively 
approximately of the increases in accounts receivable including other receivables and inventory are related to operations that began operating in during the remaining increases in accounts receivable and inventory are attributed to increased revenues at our core business 
the increase in prepaid expense is entry related cvs ferrari  srl cvs  which began operations in the third quarter of prepaid expense at cvs consists principally of advance payments made to inventory suppliers 
nearly the entire increase in accounts payable is again related to operations that began operating in during the increase in accrued expenses are attributed to increases accrued payroll and associated costs  accrued bonuses  accrued commissions and increases in income tax and other taxes payable 
the increases in the aforementioned accrued expenses are principally attributed to increase revenues and improved profitability after excluding the effect of the gain on the bargain purchases 
operations  that began operating in  also contributed to the increase in accrued expenses  but were not the principal cause of the increase 
cash flows related to investing activities consumed million of cash for the year ended december   as capital expenditures of million were partially offset by proceeds of million from the sale of equipment 
capital expenditures include approximately million of building improvements at our newly leased facility in bridgeview  illinois

operating activities generated million of cash for the year ended december   and was comprised of net earnings of million  a decrease in working capital of million offset by negative non cash items of million 
amortization and depreciation of million  a non cash charge and source of cash  was more than offset by the million non cash gain on bargain purchases and the increase in deferred taxes of million  which was primarily related to the reversal in valuation allowance related to the change in realizability of the company s deferred tax assets  as deferred tax liabilities were recorded in connection with the badger and load king acquisition 
the decrease in working capital resulted primarily from a decrease in accounts receivables of million offset by increases in inventory of million  prepaid expenses of million  other assets of million and decreases in accounts payable of million  accrued expense of million and other current liabilities of million 
the decrease in accounts receivable and accounts payable are attributed to the significant decrease in revenues from to inventory did not decrease primarily because it included finished goods related to a million sale which were shipped fob destination predominately in october and november 
the units were still in inventory as the units had not been received by the customer at december  the customer  an international agency  purchased the items and had us ship the units to remote locations  which accounted for 
table of contents the extremely long delivery times 
the increase in prepaid expense and the decrease in accrued items in part is the result of having a tax receivable and a receivable related to forward currency contracts in as opposed to liabilities for these two items in the remaining decrease in accrued expense was the result of the decrease in revenues and the associated reductions in items such as accrued warranty  bonuses  commissions  etc 
investing activities consumed million of cash 
the company used million to acquire badger and load king and invested million for capital equipment 
financing activities consumed million of cash 
during the year  the company increased its borrowing  which provided million  which was more than offset by payments of million on existing notes and capital leases and a reduction in our us credit facility of million 
new borrowings were comprised of an increase of million on our canadian credit facility  million in notes to finance insurance premiums  and million borrowed under a floorplan financing agreement  used to finance cranes purchased by crane

contingencies the company is involved in various legal proceedings  including product liability and workers compensation matters which have arisen in the normal course of operations 
certain cases are at a preliminary stage  and it is not possible to estimate the amount or timing of any cost to the company 
however  the company does not believe that these contingencies  in aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on the company 
off balance sheet arrangements on september   comerica bank issued a million euro standby letter in fulfillment of cvs s obligations under the rental agreement 
the standby letter of credit expires on july  comerica has a security interest in substantially all the assets of the company to support the standby letter of credit

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
for products shipped fob destination  sales are recognized when the product reaches its fob destination  or when the services are rendered  which represents the point when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer 
for products shipped fob shipping point  revenue is recognized when the product is shipped  as this is the point when title and risk of loss pass from us to our customers 
customers may be invoiced prior to the time customers take physical possession 
revenue is recognized in such cases only when the customer has a fixed commitment to purchase the units  the units have been completed  tested and made available to the customer for pickup or delivery  and the customer has authorized in writing that we hold the units for pickup or delivery at a time specified by the customer 
in such cases  the units are invoiced under our customary billing terms  title to the units and risks of ownership pass to the customer upon invoicing  the units are segregated from our inventory and identified as belonging to the customer and we have no further obligations under the order 
the company establishes reserve for future warranty expense at the point when revenue is recognized by the company and is based on percentage of revenues 
the provision for estimated warranty claims  which is included in cost of sales  is based on sales 
foreign currency translation and transactions 
the financial statements of the company s non us subsidiaries are translated using the current exchange rate for assets and liabilities and the weighted average exchange rate for the year for income and expense items 
resulting translation adjustments are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income oci as a component of stockholders equity 
the company converts receivables and payables denominated in other than the company s functional currency at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date 
the resulting transaction exchange gains or losses  except for certain transaction gains or losses related to intercompany receivable and payables  are included in other income and expense 
transaction gains and losses related to intercompany receivables and payables not anticipated to be settled in the foreseeable future are excluded from the determination of net income and are recorded as a translation adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income oci as a component of stockholders equity 
forward currency exchange contracts 
the company s risk management objective is to use the most efficient and effective methods available to us to minimize  eliminate  reduce or transfer the risks which are associated with fluctuation of exchange rates between the canadian and us dollar 
when the company s canadian subsidiary receives a significant new us dollar order  management will evaluate different options that may be available to mitigate future currency exchange risks 
the decision to hedge future sales is not automatic and is decided case by case 
the company will only use hedge instruments to hedge firm existing sales orders and not estimated exposure  when management determines that exchange risks exceeds desired risk tolerance levels 

table of contents the company enters into forward currency exchange contracts in relationship such that the exchange gains and losses on the assets and liabilities denominated in other than the reporting units functional currency would be offset by the changes in the market value of the forward currency exchange contracts it holds 
the forward currency exchange contracts that the company has to offset existing assets and liabilities denominated in other than the reporting units functional currency have been determined not to be considered a hedge under asc the company records at the balance sheet date the forward currency exchange contracts at its market value with any associated gain or loss being recorded in current earnings 
both realized and unrealized gains and losses related to forward currency contracts are included in current earnings and are reflected in the statement of operations in the other income expense section on the line titled foreign currency transaction losses 
items denominated in other than a reporting units functional currency includes us denominated accounts receivables and accounts payable held by our canadian subsidiary 
additionally  there is a note payable for cdn issued in connection with the liftking acquisition 
the us dollar liability for this note is adjusted each month based on the month end exchange rate  currency gains and losses are included in income each month 
beginning in the second quarter  the company entered into forward currency contracts to hedge certain future us dollar sales of its canadian subsidiary 
the decision  to hedge future sales is not automatic and is decided case by case 
the forward currency contracts to hedge future sales are designated as cash flow hedges under asc as required  forward currency contracts are recognized as an asset or liability at fair value on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings date of sale 
gains or losses on cash flow hedges when recognized into income are included in net revenues 
gains and losses on the derivative instruments representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings 
the company expects minimal ineffectiveness as the company has hedged only firm sales orders and has not hedged estimated exposures allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable is reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
the company s estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables includes evaluation of specific accounts where we have information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations 
inventories and related reserve for obsolete and excess inventory 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and are reduced by a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
the estimated reserve is based upon specific identification of excess or obsolete inventories 
other intangible assets 
the company accounts for other intangible assets under the guidance of asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
the company capitalizes certain costs related to patent technology 
additionally  a substantial portion of the purchase price related to the company s acquisitions has been assigned to patents or unpatented technology  trade name  customer backlog  and customer relationships 
under the guidance  other intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
goodwill 
goodwill  representing the difference between the total purchase price and the fair value of assets tangible and intangible and liabilities at the date of acquisition  is reviewed for impairment annually  and more frequently as circumstances warrant  and written down only in the period in which the recorded value of such assets exceed their fair value 
the company does not amortize goodwill  in accordance with financial accounting standards board the fasb accounting standards codification asc  intangibles goodwill and other asc 
the company selected october as the date for the required annual impairment test 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or a component of an operating segment that constitutes a business for which discrete financial information with 
table of contents similar economic characteristics is available and the operating results are regularly reviewed by the company s management 
the company s two operating segments comprise the reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes 
the goodwill impairment analysis is a two step process 
the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
the company evaluates goodwill for impairment using a business valuation method  which is calculated as of a measurement date by determining the present value of debt free  after tax projected future cash flows  discounted at the weighted average cost of capital of a hypothetical third party buyer 
this analysis did not indicate impairment 
the market approach was also considered in evaluating the potential for impairment by calculating fair value based on multiples of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda of comparable  publicly traded companies 
this analysis also did not indicate impairment 
moreover  we also observed implied ebitda multiples from relatively recent merger and acquisition activity in the industry  which was used to test the reasonableness of the results the determination of fair value requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to  revenue growth and operating earnings projections  discount rates  terminal growth rates  and required capital expenditure projections 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates  actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
deterioration in the market or actual results as compared with our projections may ultimately result in a future impairment 
in the event we determine that goodwill is impaired in the future  we would need to recognize a non cash impairment charge 
at october  our testing date  our market capitalization was below book value 
while the market capitalization was considered in our evaluation of fair value  the market metric is only one indicator of fair value 
it has been our opinion that the market capitalization approach is not a reliable indicator of the value for the company  either now or in the past 
our conclusion is based on the fact that trading volume on our stock is very limited  the company does not provide guidance nor is there is any significant analyst coverage 
furthermore  very modest sized trades can impact the stock price significantly because our trading volume is so low 
the second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair values of the individual assets  liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit  there is no impairment 
if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit and the subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company s policy is to assess the realizability of its long lived assets  including intangible assets  and to evaluate such assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets or group of assets may not be recoverable 
impairment is determined to exist if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value 
future cash flow projections include assumptions for future sales levels  the impact of cost reduction programs  and the level of working capital needed to support each business 
the amount of any impairment then recognized would be calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset 
the company did not have any impairment for the years ended december  and warranty expense 
the company establishes reserves for future warranty expense at point when revenue is recognized by the company and is based on a percentage of revenues 
the provision for estimated warranty claims  which is included in cost of sales  is based on sales 

table of contents litigation claims 
in determining whether liabilities should be recorded for pending litigation claims  the company must assess the allegations and the likelihood that it will successfully defend itself 
when the company believes it is probable that it will not prevail in a particular matter  it will then make an estimate of the amount of liability based  in part  on the advice of outside legal counsel 
deferred income taxes 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  the company considers all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in our most recent fiscal years and our forecast of future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
computation of earnings per share 
basic earnings per share eps was computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period 
the number of shares related to options  warrants  restricted stock and similar instruments included in diluted eps eps is based on the treasury stock method 
this method assumes theoretical repurchase of shares using proceeds of the respective stock option or warrant exercised  and for restricted stock the amount of compensation cost attributed to future services which has not yet been recognized and the amount of current and deferred tax benefit  if any  that would be credited to additional paid in capital upon the vesting of the restricted stock at a price equal to the issuer s average stock price during the related earnings period 
accordingly  the number of shares includable in the calculation of eps in respect of the stock options  warrants  restricted stock and similar instruments is dependent on this average stock price and will increase as the average stock price increases 
securities of a subsidiary that were convertible into its parent company s common stock were considered among potential common shares of the parent company for the purposes of computing consolidated diluted eps until conversion occurred 
business combinations 
the company accounts for acquisitions in accordance with guidance found in asc  business combinations 
the guidance  effective january   requires consideration given  including contingent consideration  assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be valued at their fair market values at the acquisition date 
the guidance further provides that in process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset  acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred  restructuring costs associated with a business combination will generally be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense 
asc requires that any excess of purchase price over fair value of assets acquired  including identifiable intangibles and liabilities assumed be recognized as goodwill 
in accordance with asc  any excess of fair value of acquired net assets  including identifiable intangibles assets  over the acquisition consideration results in a bargain purchase gain 
prior to recording a gain  the acquiring entity must reassess whether all acquired assets and assumed liabilities have been identified and recognized and perform re measurements to verify that the consideration paid  assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been properly valued 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
a revision of business combinations guidance which was later codified under asc  business combinations 
the revised guidance retains the underlying concepts that all business combinations are still required to be accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting  but changes the application of the acquisition method in a number of significant aspects 
acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred  noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date  in process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date  restructuring costs associated with a business 
table of contents combination will generally be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense 
in april  the fasb issued further guidance which clarifies the initial and subsequent recognition  subsequent accounting  and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination 
this requires that such contingencies be recognized at fair value on the acquisition date if fair value can be reasonably estimated during the allocation period 
if the acquisition date fair value of an asset or liability cannot be reasonably estimated  the asset or liability would be measured at the amount that would be recognized based on guidance in asc  contingencies  which provides thresholds for recognition based on probability and the ability to reasonably estimate an amount or range of amounts 
this guidance was effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual period subsequent to december   which  for the company  was january  as discussed in note acquisitions  the adoption of this guidance affected the reporting of our acquisition of badger equipment and manitex load king  inc in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r  which amends the consolidation guidance applicable to variable interest entities  later codified under asc it replaces the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary in a variable interest entity with an approach that is primarily qualitative and requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
this standard also requires additional disclosures about an enterprise s involvement in variable interest entities 
this standard is effective for us in our interim and annual reporting periods beginning on and after january  earlier application is prohibited 
adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the determination or reporting of our financial results 
in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  which amended asc  revenue recognition 
this guidance addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting  and how to allocate the consideration to each unit of accounting 
in an arrangement with multiple deliverables  the delivered item s shall be considered a separate unit of accounting if the delivered items have value to the customer on a stand alone basis 
items have value on a stand alone basis if they are sold separately by any vendor or the customer could resell the delivered items on a stand alone basis and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items  delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
arrangement consideration shall be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables based on their relative selling price  except under certain circumstances such as items recorded at fair value and items not contingent upon the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions 
the selling price for each deliverable shall be determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price  if it exists  otherwise third party evidence of selling price 
if neither vsoe nor third party evidence exists for a deliverable  the vendor shall use its best estimate of the selling price for that deliverable 
this guidance eliminates the use of the residual value method for determining allocation of arrangement consideration and allows the use of an entity s best estimate to determine the selling price if vsoe and third party evidence cannot be determined 
it also requires additional disclosures such as the nature of the arrangement  certain provisions within the arrangement  significant factors used to determine selling prices and the timing of revenue recognition related to the arrangement 
this guidance shall be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on the determination and reporting of our financial results

specifically  asu amends codification subtopic to now require a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers  and  in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs  a reporting entity should present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements 
in addition  asu clarifies the requirements of the following existing disclosures for purposes of reporting fair value measurement for each class of assets and liabilities  a reporting entity needs to use judgment in determining the appropriate classes of assets and liabilities  and  a reporting entity should provide disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years
