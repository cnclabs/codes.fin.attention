item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we engineer  manufacture and market air conditioning and heating equipment consisting of rooftop units  chillers  air handling units  make up air units  heat recovery units  condensing units  commercial self contained units and coils 
these products are marketed and sold to retail  manufacturing  educational  medical and other commercial industries 
we market units to all states in the united states and certain provinces in canada 
foreign sales were approximately of our sales 
we sell our products to property owners and contractors through a network of manufacturers representatives and our internal sales force 
demand for our products is influenced by national and regional economic and demographic factors 
the commercial and industrial new construction market is subject to cyclical fluctuations in that it is generally tied to housing starts  but has a lag factor of months 
housing starts  in turn  are affected by such factors as interest rates  the state of the economy  population growth and the relative age of the population 
when new construction is down  we emphasize the replacement market 
the principal components of cost of goods sold are labor  raw materials  component costs  factory overhead  freight out and engineering expense 
the principal high volume raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are steel  copper and aluminum  which are obtained from domestic suppliers 
the raw materials market was volatile during and due to the economic environment 
prices decreased by approximately for steel and increased by approximately for aluminum and for copper from december  to december  during  we entered into an aluminum contract for purchases that was slightly above the average index price as of december  as market prices for aluminum have shown increases since january   our contract price more closely approximates market value in we entered into a derivative instrument in the third quarter of with a large financial institution to mitigate our exposure to volatility in copper prices 
the derivative was in the form of a commodity futures contract 
the derivative contract settled monthly beginning in january and ending in december the contract was for a total of  pounds of copper at per pound 
the contract was for quantities equal to or less than those expected to be used in our manufacturing operations 
we recorded adjustments of  and million million after tax to cost of sales from the unrealized gain on derivative assets at fair value in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended and respectively 
we attempt to limit the impact of price fluctuations on these materials by entering into cancelable and noncancelable fixed price contracts with our major suppliers for periods of months 
we expect to receive delivery of raw materials from our fixed price contracts for use in our manufacturing operations 
these contracts are not accounted for as derivative instruments since they meet the normal purchases and sales exemption 
we are subject to claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business 
management believes that the ultimate liability from these claims and actions  if any  will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
selling  general  and administrative sg a costs include our internal sales force  warranty costs  profit sharing and administrative expenses 
warranty expense is estimated based on historical trends and other factors 
our product warranty policy is the earlier of one year from the date of first use or months from date of shipment for parts only  an additional four years on compressors if applicable  years on aluminized steel gas fired heat exchangers if applicable  years on stainless steel heat exchangers if applicable  and years on gas fired heat exchangers in rl products if applicable 
warranty charges on heat exchangers do not occur frequently 
with the introduction of the rq product line in  our warranty policy for the rq series was implemented to cover parts for two years from date of unit shipment and labor for one year from date of unit shipment

the property was sold in september for million million cash and we are carrying back a million note receivable 
set forth below is income statement information and as a percentage of sales for years  and years ending december  in thousands net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest expense interest income other income expense  net income before income taxes   income tax provision net income results of operations key events impacting our cash balance  financial condition and results of operations in include the following we have again taken a leading position in energy savings with the introduction of the direct drive blower which has eliminated the traditional v belt drive  thus saving energy and maintenance problems associated with the v belt drives 
this has been made possible by advances in electronic motor control by use of variable frequency drive on larger motors and electrically commutated motors on smaller horsepowers 
all of this is being further enhanced by requirements on buildings through ashrae american society of heating  refrigerating and air conditioning engineers standard which requires one of these concepts on high efficiency buildings at the present time and will be required by ashrae standard on january we also utilize a high performance composite foam panel to eliminate over half of the heat transfer from typical fib erglass insulated panels 
all of these innovations increase the demand for our products thus increasing market share 
released new products and set up new manufacturing lines in the new building addition which was completed at the end of we attempt to moderate the volatility of certain commodity costs by utilizing purchase agreements and pricing strategies which affect our gross margins 
in february  our board of directors initiated a program of semi annual cash dividend payments 
cash payments of million were made in dividends payable of million were declared in june  released for payment to our transfer agent in june and paid to stockholders in july dividends payable of million were declared and paid in december dividends payable of million were declared in december and paid in january stock repurchases resulted in cash payments of million 
this cash outlay is partially offset by cash received from options exercised by employees as a part of an incentive bonus program of million 
we have a strong liquidity position at december  with cash on hand of approximately million  million in certificates of deposit and million of current assets in corporate notes and bonds 
in view of the current economic environment  our goal remains to maintain a healthy financial condition 
purchases of equipment and renovations to manufacturing facilities remained a priority 
our capital expenditures were million 
equipment purchases create significant efficiencies  lower production costs and allow continued growth in production 
we currently estimate dedicating million to million to capital expenditures in for continued growth 
net sales net sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
sales in remained substantially level with due to the favorable reception to our new products and increased market share  despite poor economic conditions which caused non residential construction spending to decline 
the decrease in sales in from was due to decreased volume related to the economic environment and lower sales from our canadian operations 
the economic environment negatively impacted commercial construction markets with some projects delayed  postponed indefinitely or cancelled 
the replacement market was also affected by customers delaying equipment replacement as a cost saving strategy 
in  an increase in volume of products sold related to our new and redesigned products being favorably received by our customers  the diversified customer mix of products  active marketing by sales representatives and pricing strategies implemented in order to keep up with the then increasing raw material costs 
gross profit gross margins were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
gross margins decreased million in from as a percentage of sales  gross margins were  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margins in from was primarily a result of the absence of a derivative related to a copper hedge of million that we benefited from in  higher raw material and commodity costs  increased labor expenses to relocate a production line and set up new production lines for the tulsa building addition and related supplies to stock the new lines  and our inability in the current economic environment to implement price increases to our minimum sales prices for hvac units 
the increase in gross profit in from  resulted from lower material costs  improved production and labor efficiencies  a reduction in manufacturing related expenses and a million million net of tax unrealized gain from a financial derivative asset included in cost of sales  despite lower net sales and expenses associated with the canadian facility closure 
our gross margins as a percentage of sales excluding the unrealized gain were  and in  and  respectively 
the principal components of cost of goods sold are labor  raw materials  component costs  factory overhead  freight out and engineering expense 
the principal high volume raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are steel  copper and aluminum  which are obtained from domestic suppliers 
we also purchase from other domestic manufacturers certain components  including compressors  electric motors and electrical controls used in our products 
the suppliers of these components are significantly affected by the raw material costs of steel  copper and aluminum used in their products 
the raw materials market was volatile during and due to the economic environment 
prices decreased by approximately for st eel and increased by approximately for aluminum and for copper from december  to december  during  we entered into an aluminum contract for purchases that was slightly above the average index price as of december  as market prices for aluminum have shown increases since january   our contract price more closely approximates market value in we entered into a financial derivative instrument in the third quarter of with a large financial institution to mitigate our exposure to volatility in copper prices 
the financial derivative was in the form of a commodity futures contract 
the contract was for a total of  pounds of copper at per pound 
in march  we locked in the settlement price of per pound for the remainder of the contract was for quantities equal to or less than those used in our manufacturing operations in the derivative contract began settling in january and concluded in december in addition to our financial derivative instrument  we attempt to limit the impact of price fluctuations on these materials by entering into cancelable and noncancelable fixed price contracts with our major suppliers for periods of months 
we expect to receive delivery of raw materials from our fixed price contracts for use in our manufacturing operations 
these contracts are not accounted for as financial derivative instruments since they meet the normal purchases and sales exemption 
we are subject to claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business 
management believes that the ultimate liability from these claims and actions  if any  will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses were  and in  and respectively 
in  compared to  we experienced a decrease in our sg a expenses 
the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in profit sharing expense related to lower net income 
in  our sg a expenses remained consistent with  despite lower sales volumes in compared to warranty expenses in increased due to specific warranty items and sales related expenses increased due to our expanded marketing to remain competitive in the current environment 
interest expense interest expense was approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense of approximately  in from was due to increased borrowings on the revolving credit facility 
we borrowed million from the revolving credit facility during compared to million during interest on borrowings is payable monthly at the greater of or libor plus at december  
the decrease in interest expense in from was due to fewer borrowings on the revolving credit facility 
in  we borrowed million from the revolving credit facility 
average borrowings under the revolving credit facility are typically paid in full within the month of borrowing or the following month 
interest income interest income was approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in interest income of approximately  in from was mainly due to interest income from our investments in corporate notes and bonds  see note investments held to maturity 
the increase in interest income in from was mainly due to interest income from a tax refund 
other income expense other expense was approximately  in other income was approximately  and  in and  respectively 
the decrease in other income of approximately  in from was primarily due to the termination of the lease on our expansion facility in may prior to the lease expiration in may  other income was predominantly attributable to rental income from our expansion facility 
the decrease in other income in from was also primarily related to the termination of the lease 
we began renovations on the expansion facility to give us increased manufacturing capacity upon expiration of the lease 
our capital expenditures reflected the outlay to remodel the facility 
impact of current economic conditions our business is affected by a number of economic factors  including the level of economic activity in the markets in which we operate 
the state of the economy has negatively impacted the commercial and industrial new construction markets 
the decline in economic activity has resulted in a decrease in our sales volume and profitability 
sales in the commercial and industrial new construction markets correlate closely to the number of new homes and buildings that are built  which in turn is influenced by cyclical factors such as interest rates  inflation  consumer spending habits  employment rates and other macroeconomic factors over which we have no control 
analysis of liquidity and capital resources our working capital and capital expenditure requirements are generally met through net cash provided by operations and the occasional use of the revolving bank line of credit based on our current liquidity at the time 
general our revolving credit facility provides for maximum borrowings of million which is provided by the bank of oklahoma  national association 
at december   borrowings available under the revolving credit facility were million 
under the line of credit  there is one standby letter of credit totaling million 
interest on borrowings is payable monthly at the greater of or libor plus at december  
no fees are associated with the unused portion of the committed amount 
at december   we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
at december   we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
at december   we had million outstanding under the revolvi ng credit facility 
at december   and  we were in compliance with our financial ratio covenants 
the covenants are related to our tangible net worth  total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio and working capital 
at december  our tangible net worth was million which meets the requirement of being at or above million 
our total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio was to  which meets the requirement of not being above to our working capital was million which meets the requirement of being at or above million 
on july   we renewed the line of credit with a maturity date of july  with terms substantially the same as the previous agreement 
subsequently  as a requirement of our workers compensation insurance  our standby letter of credit was extended with an increase of million to million and will expire december  we expect to renew our revolving credit agreement in july we do not anticipate that the current situation in the credit market will impact our renewal 
we believe projected cash flows from operations and our bank revolving credit facility or comparable financing will provide us the necessary liquidity and capital resources for fiscal year and the foreseeable future 
the belief that we will have the necessary liquidity and capital resources is based upon our knowledge of the hvac industry and our place in that industry  our ability to limit our growth if necessary  our ability to adjust dividend cash payments  and our relationship with our existing bank lender 
for information concerning our revolving credit facility at december   see note  revolving credit facility 
cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided from operating activities has fluctuated from year to year 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the year to year variances are primarily from changes in net income  accounts receivable  inventories  accounts payable and accrued liabilities as described below 
net income was million  million and million in  and respectively 
the decrease in net income of million in from was primarily due to the absence of a derivative related to a copper hedge of million million net of tax that we benefited from in  higher raw material and commodity costs  increased labor expenses to relocate a production line and set up new production lines for the tulsa building addition and related supplies to stock the new lines  and our inability in the current economic environment to implement price increases to our minimum sales prices for hvac units 
the decrease in net income in from was primarily due to lower volume of sales which was a result of the economic environment and lower sales from our canadian operations offs et by lower material costs  improved production and labor efficiencies  a reduction in manufacturing related expenses and a million million net of tax unrealized gain from a financial derivative asset 
depreciation expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in depreciation is due to the increase in depreciable assets of equipment and building additions 
the decrease in depreciation in was due to the realization of full depreciation of certain capital assets 
share based compensation was million in each of  and both depreciation expense and share based compensation expense decreased net income  but had no effect on operating cash 
accounts receivable increased by million at december  due primarily to slower customer payments 
accounts receivable decreased by million at december  compared to december  and was attributable to a decrease in sales 
accounts receivable increased by million at december  compared to december  due to increased sales 
inventories increased by million at december  compared to december  due to an increase related to the valuation of inventories associated with higher raw material and component part prices and increased inventory levels associated with an increase in our backlog 
inventories decreased by million at december  compared to december  the decrease in inventories in from was attributable to a decrease in inventory requirements related to lower sales volumes  a decrease related to the valuation of inventories due to lower raw material and component part prices and sales of inventory as part of the canadian facility closure 
inventories increased by million at december  compared to december  primarily related to the procurement of invento ry to accommodate increased sales 
accounts payable increased by million at december  compared to december  due an increase in inventory levels and timing of payments to vendors

accrued liabilities increased by million at december  compared to december  due to an increase in amounts due to representatives and payroll partially offset by a decrease in medical self insurance reserves 
accrued liabilities increased by million at december  compared to december  the increase in accrued liabilities in from is attributable to higher warranty and medical self insurance reserves related to specific items 
accrued liabilities increased by million at december  compared to december  due to higher workers compensation expenses and higher warranty expenses related to increased sales 
cash flows used in investing activities 
cash flows used in investing activities were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash flows used in investing activities in increased significantly from and were related to a million investment with a large financial institution in january the investments were allocated to cash and money market funds  certificates of deposit  corporate notes and bonds and foreign corporate notes and bonds with a maturity of one year or less 
the investments began maturing during and at december  the investment balance was million 
the increase was also attributable to manufacturing and equipment purchases an d costs to expand our manufacturing facilities 
cash flows used in investing activities in did not significantly fluctuate from and were related to manufacturing and equipment purchases and costs to expand our manufacturing facilities 
the decrease in cash flows used in investing activities in from was primarily related to lower capital expenditures 
management utilizes cash flows provided from operating activities to fund capital expenditures that are expected to increase growth and create efficiencies 
we expect to expend approximately million million in for a building addition at the tulsa facility and machinery and equipment to accommodate anticipated growth 
we expect the cash requirements to be provided by cash flows from operations and matured investments 
we did not invest in certificates of deposits  money market funds or corporate notes and bonds in or cash flows used in financing activities 
cash flows used in financing activities were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in cash flows used in financing activities of million in from is primarily related to a higher volume of stock repurchases and the payment of million in dividends 
the decrease in cash flows used in financing activities in from was primarily related to lower volume of stock repurchases 
we occasionally utilize our revolving line of credit to meet certain short term cash demands based on our liquidity at the time

we repurchased shares of stock under the board of directors authorized stock buyback programs 
we also repurchased shares of stock from our employees k savings and investment plan  directors and officers and the open market in the amount of million for  shares  million for  shares and million for  shares of stock in  and  respectively 
on february   the board of directors voted to initiate a semi annual cash dividend 
we initially paid semi annual dividends of per share 
on july   our board of directors approved a for stock split of our outstanding stock for shareholders of record as of august  the stock split was treated as a stock dividend which was distributed on august  as a result of the stock split  our board of directors adjusted the dividend paid per share to 
the board of directors approved future dividend payments of per share on may  board approval is required to determine the date of declaration and amount for each semi annual dividend payment 
cash dividends of million were paid in cash dividends of million were paid in  and we accrued a liability for payment of million of dividends in january cash dividends of million were paid in  and million in dividends were declared and accrued as a liability in december for payment in january commitments and contractual agreements the following table summarizes our contractual agreements as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in thousands purchase obligations total contractual obligations the purchase obligation consists of an aluminum commitment with one supplier 
we expect to receive delivery of raw materials for use in our manufacturing operations 
this contract is not accounted for as a derivative instrument because it meets the normal purchases and sales exemption 
we are subject to claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business 
management believes that the ultimate liability from these claims and actions  if any  will not have a material effect on our results of operations of financial position 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
because these estimates and assumptions require significant judgment  future actual results could differ from those estimates and could have a significant impact on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions on a monthly basis 
the following accounting policies may involve a higher degree of estimation or assumption revenue recognition we recognize revenues from sales of products when the products are shipped and the title and risk of ownership pass to the customer 
final sales prices are fixed based on purchase orders 
sales allowances and customer incentives are treated as reductions to sales and are provided for based on historical experiences and current estimates 
our policy is to record the collection and payment of sales taxes through a liability account 
we present revenues net of certain payments to our independent manufacturer representatives representatives 
representatives are national companies that are in the business of providing hvac units and other related products and services to customers 
the end user customer orders a bundled group of products and services from the representative and expects the representative to fulfill the order 
only after the specifications are agreed to by the representative and the customer  and the decision is made to use an aaon hvac unit  will we receive notice of the order 
we establish the amount we must receive for our hvac unit minimum sales price  but do not control the total order price which is negotiated by the representative with the end user customer 
we are responsible for billings and collections resulting from all sales transactions  including those initiated by our representatives 
the representatives submit the total order price to us for invoicing and collection 
the total order price includes our minimum sales price and an additional amount which may include both the representatives fee and amounts due for additional products and services required by the customer 
these additional products and services may include controls purchased from another manufacturer to operate the unit  start up services  and curbs for supporting the unit third party products 
all are associated with the purchase of a hvac unit but may be provided by the representative or another third party 
the company is under no obligat ion related to third party products 
the representatives do not provide us with a break out of the amount of the total order price over the minimum sales price which includes the representatives fee and third party product amounts due to representatives 
the due to representatives amount is paid only after all amounts associated with the order are collected from the customer 
the amount of payments to our representatives was million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated to cover the risk of loss related to accounts receivable 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers  historical trends in collections and write offs  current customer status  the age of the receivable  economic conditions and other information 
aged receivables are reviewed on a monthly basis to determine if the reserve is adequate and adjusted accordingly at that time 
the evaluation of these factors involves complex  subjective judgments 
thus  changes in these factors or changes in economic circumstances may significantly impact our consolidated financial statements 
inventory reserves we establish a reserve for inventories based on the change in inventory requirements due to product line changes  the feasibility of using obsolete parts for upgraded part substitutions  the required parts needed for part supply sales  replacement parts and for estimated shrinkage 
warranty a provision is made for estimated warranty costs at the time the product is shipped and revenue is recognized 
the warranty period is the earlier of one year from the date of first use or months from date of shipment for parts only  an additional four years on compressors if applicable  years on aluminized steel gas fired heat exchangers if applicable  years on stainless steel heat exchangers if applicable  and years on gas fired heat exchangers in rl products if applicable 
with the introduction of the rq product line in  our warranty policy for the rq series was implemented to cover parts for two years from date of unit shipment and labor for one year from date of unit shipment 
warranty expense is estimated based on the warranty period  historical warranty t rends and associated costs  and any known identifiable warranty issue 
warranty charges associated with heat exchangers do not occur frequently 
due to the absence of warranty history on new products  an additional provision may be made for such products 
our estimated future warranty cost is subject to adjustment from time to time depending on changes in actual warranty trends and cost experience 
should actual claim rates differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated product warranty liability would be required 
medical insurance a provision is made for medical costs associated with our medical employee benefit plan  which is primarily a self funded plan 
a provision is made for estimated medical costs based on historical claims paid and potential significant future claims 
the plan is supplemented by employee contributions and an excess policy for claims over  each 
stock compensation we account for equity based compensation in accordance with fasc topic  compensation stock compensation 
applying this standard to value equity based compensation requires us to use significant judgment and to make estimates  particularly for the assumptions used in the black scholes valuation model  such as stock price volatility and expected option lives  as well as for the expected option forfeiture rates 
we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments using the black scholes valuation model to calculate the grant date fair value of the award 
the compensation cost is recognized over the period of time during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  which will be the vesting period 
historically  actual results have been within management s expectations 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu  which requires reporting entities to provide information about movements of assets among levels and of the three tier fair value hierarchy 
separate disclosures need to be made of the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements along with a description of the reason for the transfers 
also  disclosure of activity in level fair value measurements needs to be made on a gross basis rather than as one net number 
asu also requires fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities  and disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements  which are required for fair value measurements that fall in either level or level the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the level activity disclosures  which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued asu  topic  subsequent events asu  which discontinues the requirement that entities disclose the date through which they have evaluated subsequent events 
asu is effective upon issuance 
we adopted asu for reporting in the fourth quarter of adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements this annual report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of words such as expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates  will  and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions  which are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward looking statements 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date on which they are made 
we undertake no obligations to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
important factors that could cause results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements include the timing and extent of changes in raw material and component prices  the effects of fluctuations in the commercial industrial new construction market  the timing and extent of changes in interest rates  as well as other competitive factors during the year  and general economic  market or business conditions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk on our revolving credit facility  which bears variable interest based upon the greater of a rate of or libor plus 
we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of december  commodity price risk we entered into a financial derivative instrument in the third quarter of with a large financial institution to mitigate our exposure to volatility in copper prices 
we did not incur losses due to counterparty non performance 
we do not use financial derivatives for speculative purposes 
fluctuations in copper commodity prices impacted the value of the financial derivative we held 
the financial derivative contract began settling monthly in january and concluded in december the contract was for a total of  pounds of copper at per pound 
in march  we locked in the settlement price of per pound for the remainder of prior to locking in the settlement price  we would have been subject to gains which we would have recorded as a financial derivative asset if the forward copper commodity prices increased and losses which we would have recorded as a financial derivative liability if they decreased 
we were in an unrealized gain position on the financial derivative asset during and we settled the derivative december we used comex index pricing to support our fair value calculation  which is a level input per the valuation hierarchy as the pricing is for instruments similar but not identical to the contract we settled 
we did not designate the financial derivative as a cash flow hedge 
we recorded changes in the financial derivative s fair value in earnings based on mark to market accounting 
for the year ended december   we recorded approximately  to cost of sales from the unrealized gain on our financial derivative asset at fair value in the consolidated statements of income 
the principal components of cost of goods sold are labor  raw materials  component costs  factory overhead  freight out and engineering expense 
the principal high volume raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are steel  copper and aluminum  which are obtained from domestic suppliers 
the raw materials market was volatile during and due to the economic environment 
we have included a three year comparison to show fluctuations in raw materials costs 
prices have decreased by approximately for steel and increased by approximately for aluminum and for copper from december  to december  during  we entered into an aluminum contract for purchases that was slightly above the ave rage index price as of december  as market prices for aluminum have shown increases since january   our contract price more closely approximates market value in we are subject to claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business 
management believes that the ultimate liability from these claims and actions  if any  will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in addition to the financial derivative instrument described above  we attempt to limit the impact of price fluctuations on these materials by entering into cancelable and noncancelable fixed price contracts with our major suppliers for periods of months 
we expect to receive delivery of raw materials from our fixed price contracts for use in our manufacturing operations 
these contracts are not accounted for as financial derivative instruments since they meet the normal purchases and sales exemption 
we do not utilize financial derivative financial instruments to hedge our interest rate risk 
we occasionally use financial derivatives to economically hedge our commodity price risk
