we contribute to certain pension plans under collective bargaining agreements based on hours worked and to a discretionary profit sharing plan 
contributions were  for fiscal   for fiscal and  for fiscal we maintain self insured and deductible programs for certain liability  medical and workers compensation exposures 
other long term liabilities include known claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims not otherwise covered by insurance  based on actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience 
since the timing and amount of claim payments vary significantly  we are not able to reasonably estimate future payments for the specific periods indicated in the table above 
in connection with our self insurance programs  we have standby letters of credit aggregating  which expire in fiscal we expect to renew these standby letters of credit 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future  they may ultimately differ from actual results 
we believe that the critical accounting policies described in the following paragraphs comprise the most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as estimated and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
credit risk we sell products to a variety of customers and extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition  generally without requiring collateral 
exposure to credit losses varies by customer principally due to the financial condition of each customer 
we monitor our exposure to credit losses and maintain allowances for anticipated losses based on specific customer circumstances  credit conditions and historical write offs 
impairment of long lived assets all long lived assets  excluding goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization  are evaluated for impairment on the basis of undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair market value based on the best information available 
estimated fair market value is generally measured by discounting future cash flows 
goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment annually or sooner if we believe such assets may be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount or  for goodwill  the carrying amount of its reporting unit  is greater than its fair value 
income taxes our effective income tax rate is based on estimates of taxes which will ultimately be payable 
deferred taxes are recorded to give recognition to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
valuation allowances are established to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets when it is deemed  more likely than not  that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
insurance programs we maintain self insured and deductible programs for certain liability  medical and workers compensation exposures 
accordingly  we accrue for known claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims not otherwise covered by insurance based on actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience 
sales incentives we offer various sales incentive arrangements to our customers which require customer performance or achievement of certain sales volume targets 
in those circumstances when the incentive is paid in advance  we amortize the amount paid over the period of benefit or contractual sales volume 
when the incentive is paid in arrears  we accrue the expected amount to be paid over the period of benefit or expected sales volume 
the recognition of these incentives involves the use of judgment related to performance and sales volume estimates that are made based on historical experience and other factors 
sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction of sales and actual amounts ultimately realized may vary from accrued amounts 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodities we purchase various raw materials  including aluminum cans  plastic bottles  high fructose corn syrup and various juice concentrates  the prices of which fluctuate based on commodity market conditions 
our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
at times  we manage our exposure to this risk through the use of supplier pricing agreements that enable us to establish the purchase prices for certain commodities 
additionally  we use derivative financial instruments to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in certain raw material costs 
interest rates we had no debt related interest rate exposure during fiscal our investment portfolio is comprised of highly liquid securities consisting primarily of short term money market investments  the yields of which fluctuate based largely on short term treasury rates
