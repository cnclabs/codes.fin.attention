during the fiscal year ended september  fiscal year  overall market returns were mixed  as evidenced by a decrease in the msci world index and a increase in the s p index 
the global economy recovered during the first half of the fiscal year  but stalled during the third fiscal quarter amid concerns about economic growth and the sovereign debt crisis in europe

investment performance overview our primary focus is on the long term investment performance of our sponsored investment products 
a standard measure of the performance of a large group of these products is the percentage of aum exceeding benchmarks and peer group medians 
the performance of our equity and fixed income products was generally strong during the periods presented in the table below and our global international funds frequently outperformed the benchmarks and peer group medians 
our global international fixed income funds generated exceptional results with over of aum exceeding benchmarks and peer group medians for the three  five and ten year periods ended september  our hybrid funds performance was also exceptional with over of aum exceeding peer group medians for all periods presented below

private equity  strategic emerging market and real estate advisor funds  cash management and recently acquired uk unit trusts and australian equity funds are not included 
certain other funds and products were also excluded because of limited benchmark or peer group data

these results assume the reinvestment of dividends  are based on data available as of november  and are subject to revision 
while we remain focused on achieving strong long term performance  our future benchmark and peer group rankings may vary from our past performance

investment management fees sales and distribution fees shareholder servicing fees other  net total operating revenues investment management fees investment management fees are generally calculated under contractual arrangements with our sponsored investment products and the sub advised products that we manage as a percentage of the market value of aum 
annual rates vary by investment objective and type of services provided 
investment management fees increased million in fiscal year approximately of the increase was due to a increase in average aum  which was driven by net new flows from global international fixed income 
table of contents products and acquisitions  as well as higher valuation levels resulting from market appreciation across most investment objectives during the first nine months of the fiscal year 
the increase in fees was also impacted to a lesser extent by higher fee rates as described below 
investment management fees increased million in fiscal year approximately of the increase was due to a increase in average aum  which was driven by net new flows primarily from global international fixed income products  as well as higher valuation levels resulting from market appreciation in all investment objectives 
the remaining increase was primarily due to a higher effective investment management fee rate as described below 
our effective investment management fee rate investment management fees divided by average aum was basis points for fiscal year  as compared to basis points for fiscal year and basis points for fiscal year the rate increases primarily resulted from higher levels and relative weighting of international aum  which were driven by growth in cross border products 
generally  investment management fees earned on international products are higher than fees earned on us products as they include fees to offset higher distribution costs 
performance based investment management fees were million  million and million for fiscal years  and and did not have a significant impact on our effective investment management fee rates 
the following table presents us industry asset weighted average management fee rates in basis points industry average for the fiscal years ended september  equity global international united states hybrid fixed income tax free taxable global international united states cash management us industry asset weighted average management fee rates were calculated using information available from lipper inc as of september   and and include all us registered open end funds that reported expense data to lipper inc as of the funds most recent annual report date  and for which expenses were equal to or greater than zero 
as defined by lipper inc  management fees include fees from providing advisory and fund administration services 
the averages combine retail and institutional funds data and include all share classes and distribution channels  without exception 
variable annuity products are not included 
our actual effective investment management fee rates are generally higher than the us industry average rates as we actively manage our products and have a higher level of international aum  both of which generate higher fees 
changes to our effective investment management fee rates in the us have not varied significantly from changes in industry rates 
during fiscal year our us hybrid rate increased by approximately two basis points more than the industry rate due to the loss of a billion institutional advisory account that had a low fee rate 
investment management fees for the fiscal year ending september  may decrease from fiscal year as our aum at september  was lower than the average aum for fiscal year our product offerings and global operations are diverse 
as such  the impact of future changes in the market value of aum on investment management fees will be affected by the relative mix of investment objective  geographic region  distribution channel and investment vehicle of the assets 
sales and distribution fees we earn fees from the sale of certain classes of sponsored investment products on which investors pay a sales 
table of contents commission at the time of purchase commissionable sales 
sales commissions are reduced or eliminated on some share classes and for some sale transactions depending upon the amount invested and the type of investor 
therefore  sales fees will change with the overall level of gross sales  the size of individual transactions  and the relative mix of sales between different share classes and types of investors 
globally  our mutual funds and certain other products generally pay us distribution fees in return for sales  marketing and distribution efforts on their behalf 
specifically  the majority of us registered mutual funds  with the exception of certain of our money market mutual funds  have adopted distribution plans under rule b promulgated under the investment company act of the rule b plans 
the rule b plans permit the mutual funds to bear certain expenses relating to the distribution of their shares  such as expenses for marketing  advertising  printing and sales promotion  subject to the rule b plans limitations on amounts 
the individual rule b plans set a percentage limit for rule b expenses based on average daily net aum of the mutual fund 
similar arrangements exist for the distribution of our non us funds where  generally  the distributor of the funds in the local market arranges for and pays commissions 
we pay a significant portion of sales and distribution fees to the financial advisers and other intermediaries who sell our sponsored investment products to the public on our behalf 
see the description of sales  distribution and marketing expenses below 
overall  sales and distribution fees increased million in fiscal year sales fees increased to million for fiscal year primarily due to a higher mix of commissionable equity product sales  which typically generate higher sales fees than fixed income products 
total commissionable sales increased  however the increase had no impact on sales fees due to a higher mix of international products  which typically generate lower fees than us products 
distribution fees were  million for fiscal year  increasing over the prior year primarily due to a increase in average aum and a higher relative mix of international aum as discussed above in the investment management fees section 
distribution fees on international products are generally higher than on us products 
overall  sales and distribution fees increased million in fiscal year sales fees increased to million primarily due to a increase in total commissionable sales partially offset by a higher mix of fixed income product sales 
distribution fees increased to  million primarily due to a increase in average aum and a higher relative mix of international aum 
shareholder servicing fees we receive shareholder servicing fees as compensation for providing transfer agency services  which include providing customer statements  transaction processing  customer service  and tax reporting 
these fees are generally fixed charges per shareholder account that vary with the particular type of fund and the service being rendered 
in some instances  we charge sponsored investment products these fees based on the level of aum 
in the us  transfer agency service agreements provide that accounts closed in a calendar year generally remain billable at a reduced rate through the second quarter of the following calendar year 
in canada  such agreements provide that accounts closed in the calendar year remain billable for four months after the end of the calendar year 
accordingly  the level of fees will vary with the change in open accounts and the level of closed accounts that remain billable 
approximately million accounts closed in the us during calendar year were no longer billable effective july   as compared to approximately million accounts closed during calendar year that were no longer billable effective july  approximately million accounts closed in canada during calendar year were no longer billable effective may   compared to approximately million accounts closed during calendar year that were no longer billable effective may  shareholder servicing fees increased million in fiscal year primarily due to an million increase in europe resulting from a change in fee structures that became effective on january   a increase in simple monthly average billable shareholder accounts originated in europe  and a increase in the value of the euro against the us dollar 
shareholder servicing fees increased million in the us mainly due to a increase in simple monthly average billable shareholder accounts  partially offset by the impact of account conversions to omnibus accounts that earn lower fees 

table of contents shareholder servicing fees increased million in fiscal year primarily due to a increase in simple monthly average billable shareholder accounts  predominantly related to shareholder accounts originated in the us  and a favorable currency impact mainly resulted from a increase in the value of the canadian dollar against the us dollar 
other  net other  net revenue primarily consists of revenues from the banking finance segment  net investment income from our consolidated sponsored investment products  and income from custody services 
banking finance revenues include interest income on loans and servicing income and are reduced by interest expense and the provision for loan losses 
net investment income of our consolidated sponsored investment products is primarily comprised of dividend and interest income 
other  net revenue decreased million in fiscal year primarily due to an million decrease in banking finance segment revenues  which included million of unrealized gains on residual interests from securitization transactions recognized in the prior year  million of prior year interest income related to retained interests from securitizations that were subsequently sold  and a million decrease in interest income on debt securities 
the decrease was partially offset by a million increase in net investment income from our consolidated sponsored investment products

distribution expenses  which are typically higher for international products  are generally not directly correlated with distribution fee revenues due to international fee structures which provide for recovery of certain distribution costs through investment management fees 
sales based expenses decreased million in fiscal year total commissionable sales increased  however higher international product sales were substantially offset by lower us product sales and resulted in essentially flat sales commission expenses

variable compensation increased million  mainly due to higher bonus expense based on our performance 
commissions increased million  reflecting higher levels of sponsored investment product sales 
severance costs of million were recognized in fiscal year related to reductions to our global workforce of approximately 
higher salaries  wages and benefits during fiscal year resulting from annual merit salary adjustments  unfavorable currency impacts and higher benefit costs were largely offset by the impact of reduced staffing levels 
the level of our global workforce throughout most of the year was lower than in the prior fiscal year 
we continue to place a high emphasis on our pay for performance philosophy 
as such  any changes in the underlying performance of our sponsored investment products or changes in the composition of our incentive compensation offerings could have an impact on compensation and benefit expenses going forward 
however  in order to attract and retain talented individuals  our level of compensation and benefit expenses may increase more quickly or decrease more slowly than our revenue

as a result  such subsidiaries may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash to their parent companies 
also  as a multi national corporation  we operate in various locations outside of the us certain of our us subsidiaries are subject to regulatory or contractual repatriation restrictions or requirements 
such restrictions and requirements limit our ability to transfer cash between various international jurisdictions  including repatriation to the us should we require more capital in the us than is generated domestically  we could elect to reduce the level of discretionary activities  such as share repurchases  or we could elect to repatriate future earnings from non us jurisdictions or raise capital through debt or equity issuance 
certain of these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates  increased interest expense or other dilution to our earnings 
as of september  our us and non us subsidiaries held approximately  million and  million of our liquid assets to satisfy operational and regulatory requirements and capital contributions to our sponsored investment products 
capital resources we believe that we can meet our present and reasonably foreseeable operating cash needs and future commitments through existing liquid assets  continuing cash flows from operations  the ability to issue debt or equity securities and borrowing capacity under current credit facilities

the banking finance segment secures advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb to fund its retail banking and consumer lending services 
at september   we had million of fhlb advances outstanding 
these advances had a weighted average interest rate of at september  and are subject to collateralization requirements 
in may  we issued senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes with a face value of million 
of the notes  million was issued at a fixed interest rate of per annum and matures in  million was issued at a fixed interest rate of per annum and matures in  and million was issued at a fixed interest rate of and matures in interest is payable semi annually 
the indenture governing the notes contains limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to pledge voting stock or profit participating equity interests in our subsidiaries to secure other debt without similarly securing the notes equally and ratably 
as of september   we were in compliance with the covenants of the notes 
at september   we had million of short term commercial paper available for issuance under an uncommitted private placement program  and million available in uncommitted short term bank lines of credit 
our banking finance segment had million available in uncommitted short term bank lines of credit under the federal reserve system  million available through the secured federal reserve bank short term discount window and million available in secured fhlb short term borrowing capacity 
our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors  including our credit rating  the condition of the global economy  investors willingness to purchase our securities  interest rates  credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets 
if we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner  our business could be adversely impacted 
uses of capital we expect that our main uses of cash will be to expand our core business  make strategic acquisitions  acquire 
table of contents shares of our common stock  fund property and equipment purchases  invest in our sponsored investment products  pay operating expenses of the business  enhance technology infrastructure and business processes  pay stockholder dividends and repay and service debt 
on september   our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of per share which was payable on october  to stockholders of record on september  in july  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of balanced equity management pty 
limited bem  a specialty australian equity manager  for million in cash and  shares of franklin common stock with an aggregate value of million at the acquisition date  for a total purchase consideration of million 
in january  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of rensburg fund management limited  a specialty uk equity manager  for million in cash 
in december  we purchased an office building to be used in business operations in fort lauderdale  florida for million in cash 
during fiscal year  we invested million  net of redemptions  in our sponsored investment products 
we maintain a stock repurchase program to manage our equity capital with the objective of maximizing shareholder value 
our stock repurchase program is effected through regular open market purchases and private transactions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations 
during fiscal year  we repurchased million shares of our common stock at a cost of million 
the common stock repurchases made as of september  reduced our capital in excess of par value to nil and the excess amount was recognized as a reduction to retained earnings 
at september   approximately million shares of our common stock remained available for repurchase under our stock repurchase program 
our stock repurchase program is not subject to an expiration date 
the funds that we manage have their own resources available for purposes of providing liquidity to meet shareholder redemptions  including securities that can be sold or provided to investors as in kind redemptions  and lines of credit 
while we have no contractual obligation to do so  we may voluntarily elect to provide the funds with direct or indirect financial support based on our business objectives 

table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes contractual cash obligations and commitments 
we believe that we can meet these obligations and commitments through existing liquid assets  continuing cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under current credit facilities

long term debt consists of notes and fhlb advances 
operating lease obligations are presented net of future receipts on contractual sublease arrangements totaling million 
purchase obligations include contractual amounts that will be due to purchase goods and services to be used in our operations and may be canceled at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may include termination fees 
committed capital contributions primarily relate to discretionary commitments to invest in planned sponsored investment product launches 
the debt holders of consolidated sponsored investment products have no recourse to our assets beyond the level of our direct investment in these entities 
on october   the company adopted new accounting guidance related to the consolidation of vies 
the adoption of the guidance resulted in the consolidation of vies that were not previously consolidated with long term debt of  million as of october  the debt holders of the vies have recourse only to the corresponding collateralized assets of the vies 
see note new accounting guidance  note variable interest entities  and note debt  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this form k 
as of september   our consolidated balance sheet reflects a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million  and related accrued interest of million see note taxes on income in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this form k 
the amount of unrecognized tax benefits and related interest that are expected to be paid in the next twelve months are million and million 
however  because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits  a reasonable estimate of the period of cash payments beyond the next twelve months from the balance sheet date of september  cannot be made 
consequently  unrecognized tax benefits have not been included in the table above 
contingent obligations we are obligated to cover shortfalls for the consolidated automobile loan securitization trusts in amounts due to the holders of asset backed securities up to certain levels 
at september   the maximum potential amount of future payments related to these guarantees was million and the fair value of the guarantees recognized as banking finance liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet was not significant 
at september   the banking finance segment had issued financial standby letters of credit totaling 
table of contents million on which beneficiaries would be able to draw upon in the event of non performance by our customers  primarily in relation to lease and lien obligations of these banking customers 
these standby letters of credit were fully collateralized by marketable securities at september  off balance sheet arrangements in our role as agent or trustee  we facilitate the settlement of investor share purchase  redemption  and other transactions with affiliated mutual funds

as of september  and  we held cash of approximately million and million off balance sheet in agency or trust for investors and the affiliated mutual funds 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
these estimates  judgments  and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies 
below we describe certain critical accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding our results of operations and financial position 
for additional information about our accounting policies  please refer to note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this form k 
consolidation we consolidate our subsidiaries and sponsored investment products in which we have a controlling financial interest 
we are generally considered to have a controlling financial interest when we own a majority of the voting interest in an entity 
we also consolidate vies for which we are considered the primary beneficiary and non vie limited partnerships and similar structures for which we are deemed to have control 
a vie is an entity in which the equity investment holders have not contributed sufficient capital to finance its activities or the equity investment holders do not have defined rights and obligations normally associated with an equity investment 
we provide investment management services to various investment entities that we sponsor in the normal course of business 
we also invest in various entities in the normal course of business 
certain of these entities are considered to be vies 
the assessment of whether an entity is a vie or voting interest entity voe involves judgment and analysis on a structure by structure basis 
when performing the assessment we consider factors such as the entity legal organization and our contractual involvement with and ownership interest in the entity 
a limited partnership or similar structure entity for which we are the general partner or managing member  our aggregate investment is not substantive and the limited partners or other investors do not have the substantive ability to remove us as the general partner or managing member or to otherwise participate in the decision making of the entity is a vie 
otherwise the entity is a voe and we are presumed to control the entity unless the limited partners or other investors have the substantive ability to remove us as the general partner or managing member or to otherwise participate in the decision making of the entity 
we use two different models for determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of vies 
for all investment entities with the exception of clos  we are considered to be the primary beneficiary if we have the majority of the risks and rewards of ownership 
for all other vies  including clos  we are considered to be the primary beneficiary if we have the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of or right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
the variable interests that we have in investment entity vies  other than clos  generally consist of our equity ownership interest in and investment management and related service fees earned from these vies 
we use expected cash flow scenarios to determine if our investment management and related service fees and or equity ownership 
table of contents interests provide us with a majority of the vie expected losses or residual returns 
based on our evaluation  we determined we were not the primary beneficiary of these vies and  as a result  did not consolidate these entities as of and for the twelve months ended september  we provide collateral management services to clos which are considered vies 
these clos are asset backed financing entities collateralized by a pool of assets  primarily corporate loans and  to a lesser extent  high yield bonds 
we generally earn management fees in the form of senior and subordinated management fees from the clos based on the par value of outstanding investments and  in certain instances  may also receive performance based fees 
in addition  we hold equity interests in certain of these investment vehicles 
we determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the clos as we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the clos economic performance in our role as collateral manager and hold a variable interest for which we have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the clos 
in previous years we entered into automobile loan securitization transactions with securitization trusts  which then issued asset backed securities to private investors 
we retained certain interests as part of the securitization transactions  which consist of interest only strips receivable and cash on deposit 
we also retained servicing responsibilities for the securitization trusts and receive annual servicing fees 
our services primarily consist of the management  service and administration of the loans  collection and posting of payments  and maintenance of accounts for the benefit of  and making distributions to  the holders of the asset backed securities 
we determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the securitization trusts as we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the securitization trusts economic performance in our role as servicer and hold a variable interest for which we have the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the securitization trusts 
the securitization trusts were not subject to consolidation under the accounting guidance in effect prior to october  our evaluation of whether we qualify as the primary beneficiary of vies is highly complex and involves significant judgments  estimates and assumptions 
the key estimates and assumptions used in our analyses may include the amount of aum  investment management and related service fee rates  the life of the investment product  and the discount rate 
these estimates and assumptions are subject to variability 
for example  aum is impacted by market volatility and the level of sales  redemptions  contributions  withdrawals and dividend reinvestments of mutual fund shares that occur daily 
in addition  third party purchases and redemptions  which are outside of our control  can impact our evaluation 
collateralized assets of clos and securitization trusts are impacted by market volatility and prepayment rates 
there is judgment involved in assessing whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact vies economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from vies that could potentially be significant to the vies 
while we believe that our evaluation is appropriate  future changes in estimates  judgments  and assumptions may affect the determination of primary beneficiary status and the resulting consolidation of vies in our consolidated financial statements 
fair value measurements we use a three level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable 
the three levels of fair value hierarchy are set forth below 
our assessment of the hierarchy level of the assets or liabilities measured at fair value is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
transfers between levels are recognized at the end of each quarter 

table of contents level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable inputs other than level quoted prices  such as non binding quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or corroborated by observable market data 
level quoted prices are generally obtained from two independent third party brokers or dealers  including prices derived from model based valuation techniques for which the significant assumptions are observable in the market or corroborated by observable market data 
quoted prices are validated through price variance analysis  subsequent sales testing  stale price review  price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of third party vendors 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity 
these inputs require significant management judgment and reflect our estimation of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
level valuations are derived primarily from model based valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable in the market 
we record the majority of our investments in the consolidated financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value 
trading securities and securities available for sale are financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
we may also measure certain assets or liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 
these fair value measurements generally result from the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or write downs of individual assets 
fair values are estimated for disclosure purposes for financial instruments that are not measured at fair value 
as of september   level assets represented of total assets measured at fair value  substantially all of which related to consolidated sponsored investment products investments in equity and secured and unsecured debt securities of entities in emerging markets which are not traded in active markets 
level liabilities  comprised of long term debt of consolidated vies  represented of total liabilities measured at fair value at september  transfers into and out of level during fiscal year were immaterial 
the following is a description of the significant assets and liabilities measured at fair value  the fair value methodologies used  and the fair value hierarchy level 
investment securities  trading consist primarily of non consolidated sponsored investment products held for trading purposes and securities held by consolidated sponsored investment products 
changes in the fair value of trading securities are recognized as gains and losses in earnings 
the fair value of non consolidated sponsored investment products is determined based on the published net asset values of the sponsored investment products  and they are classified as level the fair value of securities held by consolidated sponsored investment products is primarily determined using quoted market prices  or independent third party broker or dealer price quotes if quoted market prices are not available 
these securities are primarily classified as level or level if events occur after the close of the primary market for any security  the quoted market prices may be adjusted for the observable price movements within country specific market proxies 
consolidated sponsored investment products may also hold securities that are classified as level because their fair value is determined using significant unobservable inputs 
in these instances  we primarily employ a market based valuation method  which may use prices of recent transactions  various market multiples  book values and other relevant information for the investment or related or other comparable assets to determine the fair value of the investment 
in developing this fair value  we may also give consideration to an income based valuation method  which considers anticipated future cash flows of the investment and converts those amounts into a net present value 
a discount may also be applied due to the nature or duration of any restrictions on the disposition of the asset 
investment securities  available for sale consist primarily of non consolidated sponsored investment products and debt securities including securities of us states and political subdivisions  securities of the us treasury and federal agencies  corporate debt securities  mortgage backed securities  and other equity securities 
realized gains and losses are included in investment income using either the average cost method or specific identification method 

table of contents unrealized gains and losses are recorded net of tax as part of accumulated other comprehensive income until realized 
the fair value of non consolidated sponsored investment products is determined based on the published net asset values of the sponsored investment products and they are classified as level the fair value of debt securities is determined using quoted market prices  if available  or independent third party broker or dealer price quotes  which are evaluated for reasonableness  and they are generally classified as level  except for certain us treasury securities which are classified as level the fair value of other equity securities  which consist primarily of non sponsored investment products  is generally determined based on the published net asset values of the investment products and they are classified as level we may also hold other equity securities that are classified as level because their fair value is determined using significant unobservable inputs 
in these instances we primarily employ the market based valuation method described above for level securities held by consolidated sponsored investment products 
investment securities  available for sale are evaluated for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis when the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value 
for available for sale equity securities  we consider many factors  including the severity and duration of the decline in the fair value below cost  our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value  and the financial condition and specific events related to the issuer 
when an impairment of an available for sale equity security is determined to be other than temporary  the impairment is recognized in earnings 
for available for sale debt securities  if we intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost  the entire impairment is recognized in earnings 
if we do not intend to sell or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before anticipated recovery of its amortized cost  the impairment is separated into the amount of the total impairment related to the credit loss and the amount of the total impairment related to all other factors 
the credit loss component is the difference between the security s amortized cost and the present value of the expected cash flows 
the credit loss component is recognized in earnings and the losses related to all other factors are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income 
while we believe that we have accurately estimated the amount of other than temporary impairment in our portfolio  different assumptions could result in changes to the recorded amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
investments of consolidated sponsored investment products consist primarily of direct investments in equity and secured and unsecured debt securities of entities in emerging markets  which are generally not traded in active markets 
the fair value of these investments is generally determined using significant unobservable inputs and they are classified as level in these instances  we employ a market based method  using purchase multiples observed for comparable third party transactions  projected operating results of the investment  valuations of comparable companies  and subsequent financing transactions entered into by the investee entities 
if the market based method is not available  we utilize an income based method  which considers the net present value of anticipated future cash flows of the investment 
a discount may also be applied due to the nature or duration of any restrictions on the disposition of the investment 
investments and long term debt of consolidated vies consist of the assets and liabilities of consolidated clos 
these clos are asset backed financing entities collateralized by a pool of assets  primarily corporate loans and  to a lesser extent  high yield bonds 
we elected the fair value option for all assets and liabilities of the consolidated clos 
the fair values of investments and debt held by the consolidated clos are primarily obtained from independent third party broker or dealer price quotes and they are classified as level the clos also hold securities and have issued debt that are classified as level because their fair values are determined using significant unobservable inputs 
in these instances  we primarily employ a market based valuation method  which uses prices of recent transactions  various market multiples  book values and other relevant information for the instrument or related or other comparable instruments to determine the fair value 
if the market based valuation method is not available  we utilize an income based valuation method  which considers the net present value of anticipated future cash flows of the instrument 
a discount may also be applied due to the nature or duration of any restrictions on the disposition of the instrument 
while we believe the valuation methodologies described above are appropriate  the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 

table of contents intangible assets consist primarily of mutual fund management contracts and customer base assets resulting from business acquisitions 
we amortize intangible assets over their estimated useful lives  which range from three to years  using the straight line method  unless the asset is determined to have an indefinite useful life 
indefinite lived intangible assets primarily represent contracts to manage mutual fund assets for which there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period 
we make significant estimates and assumptions when valuing goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the initial purchase price allocation of an acquired entity  as well as when evaluating impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on an ongoing basis 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
our goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step requires the identification of the reporting units  and comparison of the fair value of each of these reporting units to the respective carrying value 
if the carrying value is less than the fair value  no impairment exists and the second step is not performed 
if the carrying value is higher than the fair value  there is an indication that impairment may exist and the second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in the second step  the impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
we have two reporting units  investment management and related services and banking finance  which are the same as our operating segments 
all goodwill has been assigned to the investment management and related services reporting unit 
indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired 
impairment is indicated when the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and indefinite lived intangible assets  we use valuation techniques based on an income approach under which future cash flows are discounted 
our future cash flow estimates include assumptions about revenue and aum growth rates  the pre tax profit margin  the average effective fee rate  the effective tax rate  and the discount rate  which is based on our weighted average cost of capital 
the most relevant of these assumptions to the determination of estimated fair value are the aum growth rate and the discount rate 
we performed our annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of august  we did not recognize any impairment because our estimates of the fair values of our reporting unit and our indefinite lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values 
the fair value of the investment management and related services reporting unit and over of the indefinite lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying values by more than 
the assumptions used in our annual impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets were developed taking into account the ongoing volatility in the capital and credit markets 
as a result  the growth rate assumptions used as of august  were lower than the historical compounded growth rates 
we estimated the discounted future cash flows using a compounded annual aum growth rate for goodwill and over of our indefinite lived intangible assets  and a discount rate of 
we subsequently monitor the market conditions and their potential impact on the assumptions used in the annual calculations of fair value to determine whether circumstances have changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying value  or indicate that our indefinite lived intangible assets might be impaired 
we consider  among other things  changes in our aum and weighted average cost of capital by assessing whether these changes would impact the reasonableness of the assumptions used in our impairment tests as of august  we also monitor fluctuations of our common stock per share price to evaluate our market capitalization relative to the reporting unit as a whole 
subsequent to august   there were no impairments to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets as we determined no events occurred or circumstances changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value  or indicate that our indefinite lived intangible assets might be impaired 
we test definite lived intangible assets for impairment quarterly 
impairment is indicated when the carrying value 
table of contents of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
in evaluating the recoverability of definite lived intangible assets  we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows to be derived from these assets 
our future undiscounted cash flow projections include assumptions about revenue and aum growth rates  effective fee rates  investor redemptions  the pre tax profit margin  and expected useful lives 
the most relevant of these assumptions to determine future cash flows is the change in the amount of aum 
the assumptions used in our impairment tests are developed taking into consideration the ongoing market conditions 
if the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows  we measure the impairment loss based on the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the fair value of the asset is determined by discounted cash flows or other methods as appropriate for the asset type 
as of september   million  or of our definite lived intangible assets related to investment management contracts of fiduciary trust company international ftci 
the undiscounted future cash flow projections for ftci institutional and high net worth management contracts exceeded their carrying values by and  respectively 
the remaining balance primarily consists of assets acquired in july in connection with our acquisition of bem 
no events occurred or circumstances changed since the acquisition date that would indicate that these assets might be impaired 
we estimated the future undiscounted cash flows for the ftci definite lived intangible assets using aum growth rates ranging from to 
the assumptions used in the impairment tests for definite lived intangible assets were developed taking into consideration ongoing market conditions 
as of september   a decline in aum of approximately could cause us to evaluate whether the fair value of the ftci definite lived intangible assets is below the carrying value 
while we believe that our impairment tests and the assumptions used to estimate fair value are reasonable and appropriate  if the assumptions used in our estimates of fair value change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges or otherwise accelerate amortization expense 
revenues we recognize investment management fees  shareholder servicing fees and distribution fees as earned over the period in which services are rendered  except for performance based investment management fees  which are recognized when earned 
we recognize sales commissions related to the sale of shares of our sponsored investment products on the trade date 
investment management fees are generally determined based on a percentage of aum  except for performance based investment management fees  which are based on performance targets established in the related investment management contracts 
generally  shareholder servicing fees are calculated based on the number and type of accounts serviced  while distribution fees are generally based on a percentage of aum 
aum is calculated for our sponsored investment products using fair value methods derived primarily from unadjusted quoted market prices  unadjusted independent third party broker or dealer price quotes in active markets  or market prices or price quotes adjusted for observable price movements after the close of the primary market 
the fair values of securities for which market prices are not readily available are internally valued using various methodologies which incorporate unobservable inputs as appropriate for each security type 
the pricing of the securities held by our sponsored investment products is governed by a global valuation and pricing policy  which defines valuation and pricing conventions for each security type  including practices for responding to unexpected or unusual market events 
as of september   our total aum by fair value hierarchy level was level  level and level as substantially all of our aum is valued based on observable market prices or inputs  market risk is the most significant risk underlying the valuation of our aum 
while recent economic conditions have increased market price volatility  the fair value of substantially all of the securities held by sponsored investment products continues to be derived from observable market inputs 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
table of contents and the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year when the reported amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled  respectively 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying values of deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
for each tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
we recognize the accrual of interest on uncertain tax positions in interest expense and penalties in other operating expenses 
as a multi national corporation  we operate in various locations outside the us and generate earnings from our us subsidiaries 
we indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our non us subsidiaries  except for income previously taxed in the us  subject to regulatory or legal repatriation restrictions or requirements  and the excess net earnings reduced by cash needs for operational and regulatory capital requirements  capital management plans and capital expenditure plans of our canadian and uk consolidated subsidiaries 
as a result  we have not recognized a provision for us income taxes and a deferred income tax liability on billion of cumulative undistributed non us earnings that are indefinitely reinvested at september  changes to our policy of reinvestment or repatriation of non us earnings may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
loss contingencies we are involved in various lawsuits and claims encountered in the normal course of business 
when such a matter arises and periodically thereafter  we consult with our legal counsel and evaluate the merits of the claims based on the facts available at that time 
in management s opinion  an adequate accrual has been made as of september  to provide for probable losses that may arise from these matters for which we could reasonably estimate an amount

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position is subject to market risk  including  but not limited to  potential loss due to changes in the value of financial instruments including those resulting from adverse changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and market valuation 
financial instruments include  but are not limited to  investment securities  loans  deposits and debt obligations 
management is responsible for managing market risk 
our enterprise risk management committee is responsible for providing a framework to assist management to identify  assess  and manage market and other risks 
we are also exposed to market risk through our investment management and distribution fees  which are generally calculated as a percentage of the market value of aum 
changes in equity market prices  interest rates  credit spreads  foreign exchange rates  or a combination of these factors could cause the value of aum to decline  which would result in lower investment management and distribution fees 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily through our loans  investment in debt securities  and outstanding debt 
we minimize the impact of changes in interest rates related to our investments in debt securities by managing the maturities of these securities  and through diversification 
we minimize the impact of changes in interest rates related to our outstanding debt by entering into financing transactions that ensure an appropriate mix of debt at fixed and variable interest rates 
in addition  our banking finance segment monitors the net interest rate margin and the average maturity of interest earning assets  as well as funding sources 
from time to time  we may enter into interest rate swap agreements to mitigate interest rate exposure arising from the loans receivable portfolio 
as of september   we have considered the potential impact of a basis point movement in market interest rates on our interest earning assets  net of interest bearing liabilities  total debt outstanding and our portfolio of debt securities 
based on our analysis  we do not expect that such a change would have a material impact on our operating revenues or results of operations in the next twelve months  for each of these categories or in the aggregate
