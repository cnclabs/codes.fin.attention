item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the following discussion  general communication  inc and its direct and indirect subsidiaries are referred to as we  us and our 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to the allowance for doubtful receivables  unbilled revenues  accrual of the usf high cost area program subsidy  share based compensation  reserve for future customer credits  valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets  depreciable and amortizable lives of assets  the carrying value of long lived assets including goodwill  cable certificates and wireless licenses  our effective tax rate  purchase price allocations  the accrual of cost of goods sold exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense cost of goods sold  depreciation  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
see also our cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and supplementary data as presented in item of this form k 
general overview through our focus on long term results  acquisitions  and strategic capital investments  we strive to consistently grow our revenues and expand our margins 
we have historically met our cash needs for operations  regular capital expenditures and maintenance capital expenditures through our cash flows from operating activities 
historically  cash requirements for significant acquisitions and major capital expenditures have been provided largely through our financing activities 
the weakness in the national economy has negatively impacted consumer confidence and spending 
there are some indicators that consumer confidence might be improving  however  there is no clear indication that the economy is in a recovery 
continued stress in the economy could lead to reductions in consumer spending which could impact our revenue growth 
we believe the alaska economy continues to perform well compared to most other states at the current time 
mortgage foreclosure rates in alaska are among the lowest in the nation and the commercial real estate market is steady 
the state of alaska has large cash reserves that should enable it to maintain its budget for at least the short term 
this is important for alaska s economy as the state is the largest employer and second largest source of gross state product 
the majority of our revenue is driven by the strength of the alaska economy which appears to have weathered the recessionary pressures relatively well to date 
nonetheless we cannot predict the impact the nation s economic changes may have on us in the future 
effective june   we purchased of the outstanding stock of uui and unicom 
the financial results of the long distance  local access and internet services sold to consumer and commercial customers of certain of these acquired companies are reported in the regulated operations segment 
the financial results of the long distance services sold to other common carrier customers and the managed broadband services components of certain of these acquired companies are included in the network access and managed broadband services segments  respectively 
effective july   we closed on our purchase of of the ownership interests of alaska wireless whose results are included in the consumer segment

consumer segment revenues the increase in voice revenue is primarily due to a million or increase in usac support 
we accrue estimated high cost support revenue quarterly and adjust our revenue as we obtain new information that changes the variables used to calculate our estimate 
the increase in usf high cost support is primarily due to changes in the variables used to calculate our estimate and an increase in the number of local subscribers 
this increase was partially off set by an absence of  in support in related to services provided during the year ended december  in march  the fcc issued an order which provided uncapped support for all lines served by competitive etcs for tribal lands in alaska native regions retroactive to august this revenue was for the additional support for the period august to december the increase in video revenue is primarily due to the following a increase in programming services revenue to million in primarily resulting from an increase in digital programming tier subscribers in and a rate increase on certain cable service offerings beginning in august  and an increase in equipment rental revenue to million in primarily resulting from our customers increased use of our hd dvr converter boxes 
the increase in data revenue is primarily due to a increase in cable modem revenue to million due to increased subscribers  rate increases in may and august  our subscribers selection of plans that offer higher speeds  and an increase in charges for usage above plan limits 
the increase in wireless revenue is primarily due to the following a million increase in usac support to million 
this increase includes a million increase in usf high cost support and a million increase in usf low income support 
we accrue estimated usf high cost support revenue quarterly and adjust our revenue as we obtain new information that changes the variables used to calculate our estimate 
the increase in usf high cost support is primarily due to changes in the variables used to calculate our estimate  an increase in the number of wireless subscribers and million for amended line count filings for which the revenue recognition criteria was met in the third quarter of the increase in usf low income support is due to an increase in the number of wireless subscribers who qualify under this program  and a million increase in plan fee revenue to million due to an increase in the number of wireless subscribers 
these increases were partially off set by the following an absence of million in support recorded in related to services provided during the year ended december  the support was for a new local access area for which we received etc status in may collectability was not reasonably assured until we were awarded etc status  therefore we deferred revenue recognition until such status was confirmed  and an absence of  recorded in related to services provided during the year ended december  in march  the fcc issued an order which provided uncapped support for all lines served by competitive etcs for tribal lands in alaska native regions retroactive to august this revenue was for the additional support for the period august to december consumer segment cost of goods sold the decrease in voice cost of goods sold is primarily due to decreased voice minutes carried  cost savings resulting from the increased deployment of local access services lines on our own facilities during  and a  favorable adjustment based upon refunds from several vendors 
in the course of business we estimate unbilled long distance services cost of goods sold based upon minutes of use processed through our network and established rates 
such estimates are revised when subsequent billings are received  payments are made  billing matters are researched and resolved  tariffed billing periods lapse  or when disputed charges are resolved 
the increase in video cost of goods sold is primarily due to increased channels offered to our subscribers  increased rates paid to programmers  increased costs associated with delivery of digital services offered through our hd dvr converter boxes due to the increased number of boxes in service  and an increase in digital programming tier subscribers 
the increases were partially offset by the absence of a  charge in to settle a billing issue with a cable programmer 
the decrease in data cost of goods sold is primarily due to the transition of traffic to our own facilities from leased facilities 
the increase in wireless cost of goods sold is primarily due to increased costs for wireless handset equipment sales associated with the increased number of wireless subscribers and an increased number of premium wireless handsets which have higher costs 
as part of an agreement signed in december with at t mobility  at t mobility has provided to us a large block of wireless network usage at no charge that we use for roaming 
we expect this block of minutes to expire in the first half of at which time we expect a material increase to our wireless cost of goods sold estimated at million to million annually 
consumer segment adjusted ebitda the adjusted ebitda increase is primarily due to increased revenue as described above in consumer segment revenues 
the increase was partially offset by increased cost of goods sold as described above in consumer segment cost of goods sold and an increase in the selling  general and administrative expense that was allocated to our consumer segment 
the increase in allocated selling  general and administrative expense is due primarily to an increase in the segment margin upon which the selling  general and administrative expense allocation is based and an increase in consolidated selling  general and administrative expense

voice revenue continues to decline as expected due to increased competition in the network access business 
the increased competition will continue to compress the rates we may charge our customers and  therefore  we expect a continued decline in network access segment voice revenue 
the decrease is partially offset by a million increase from growth of services sold 
the decrease in data revenue is primarily due to decreased rates for capacity purchased by our common carrier customers 
the increase in wireless revenue is due to increased roaming revenue in primarily due to improved coverage and new roaming partners 
network access segment cost of goods sold the decrease in voice cost of goods sold is primarily due to decreased long distance minutes carried  the movement of more traffic onto our network in lieu of carrying traffic on third party networks  and a  favorable adjustment based upon refunds from several vendors 
in the course of business we estimate unbilled long distance services cost of goods sold based upon minutes of use processed through our network and established rates 
such estimates are revised when subsequent billings are received  payments are made  billing matters are researched and resolved  tariffed billing periods lapse  or when disputed charges are resolved 
the decreases were partially offset by a million increase from growth of services sold 
the decrease in data cost of goods sold is primarily due to the transition of traffic to our own facilities from leased facilities and a  favorable adjustment based upon refunds from several vendors 
in the course of business we estimate unbilled data services cost of goods sold based upon minutes of use processed through our network and established rates 
such estimates are revised when subsequent billings are received  payments are made  billing matters are researched and resolved  tariffed billing periods lapse  or when disputed charges are resolved 
the decreases were partially offset by the absence of a  favorable adjustment in resulting from a refund of fiber repair costs 
the fiber repair costs were originally recognized in the first quarter of due to the uncertainty surrounding the refund of the fiber repair costs  we deferred recognition until collection of the refund was reasonably assured 
network access segment adjusted ebitda the adjusted ebitda decrease is primarily due to decreased revenue as described in network access segment revenues 
this decrease is partially off set by decreased cost of goods sold as described in network access segment cost of goods sold and a decrease in the selling  general and administrative expense that was allocated to our network access segment primarily due to a decrease in the segment margin upon which the selling  general and administrative expense allocation is based

we accrue estimated usf high cost support revenue quarterly and adjust our revenue as we obtain new information that changes the variables used to calculate our estimate 
the increase in usf high cost support is primarily due to changes in the variables used to calculate our estimate and an increase in the number of local subscribers  and a  or increase in local plan fee revenue due to an increase in the number of lines in service 
these increases in voice revenue were partially offset by an  or decrease in long distance plan fee revenue due to a decrease in subscribers and minutes carried 
the increase in video revenue is primarily due to an increase in sales of cable advertising services due to state and federal political advertising and the return of seasonal tourism advertising which was negatively affected in by the general economic slowdown

the increase in data cost of goods sold is primarily due to an million or increase in managed services project cost of goods sold related to the increased revenue described above in commercial segment revenues 
the increase in wireless cost of goods sold is primarily due to increased costs for wireless handset equipment sales associated with the increased number of wireless subscribers 
commercial segment adjusted ebitda the adjusted ebitda increase was primarily due to increased revenue as described in commercial segment revenues 
this increase was partially off set by increased cost of goods sold as described in commercial segment cost of goods sold  and an increase in the selling  general and administrative expense that was allocated to our commercial segment primarily due to an increase in consolidated selling  general and administrative expense

regulated operations segment revenues regulated operations segment revenues decreased from million in to million in primarily due to projected lower levels of eligible cost recovery resulting from changes in lines in service  traffic sensitive activity levels and reserve adjustments 
regulated operations segment cost of goods sold regulated operations segment cost of goods sold decreased from million in to million in primarily due to a change in allocation of network maintenance costs which resulted in a decrease to our regulated operations segment and an increase to our consumer  network access  commercial and managed broadband segments 
regulated operations segment adjusted ebitda regulated operations segment adjusted ebitda increased to million in see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part i of this annual report on form k for a reconciliation of consolidated adjusted ebitda  a non gaap financial measure  to consolidated income before income tax expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million in primarily due to the following a million increase in health benefit costs  a million increase in labor costs  a million increase in share based compensation expense primarily due to the absence of a million reversal of expense in the expense had been properly recognized in previous periods for certain performance based stock options and restricted stock awards but in the third quarter of we determined they were not expected to vest  million in costs  including workers compensation expense  related to an accident involving our company owned aircraft in august  and a  increase in our company wide success sharing bonus accrual 
the increases were partially off set by the following a million decrease in sales expense  the absence of million in costs for the conversion of our customers wireless phones to our facilities in  and the absence of a  contribution expense recognized upon the gift of an iru to the university of alaska that was recorded in as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in  primarily due to increasing revenues 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased million to million in primarily due to new assets placed in service in partially offset by assets which became fully depreciated during other expense  net other expense  net of other income  increased to million in primarily due to a million increase in interest expense to million in the interest expense increase is due to the issuance of the notes in november  which have a higher interest rate than the interest rate paid on our amended senior credit facility  and a higher average outstanding debt balance during than the proceeds from the issuance of the notes were primarily used to repay and retire the outstanding amount due on our amended senior credit facility 
income tax expense income tax expense totaled million and million in and  respectively 
our effective income tax rate decreased from in to in at december   we have tax net operating loss carryforwards of million that will begin expiring in if not utilized  and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of million available to offset regular income taxes payable in future years 
we have recorded deferred tax assets of million associated with income tax net operating losses that were generated from to and that expire from to  and with charitable contributions that were converted to net operating losses in through  and that expire in through  respectively 
tax benefits associated with recorded deferred tax assets are considered to be more likely than not realizable through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
the amount of deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced which would result in additional income tax expense 
we estimate that our effective annual income tax rate for financial statement purposes will be to in the year ended december   primarily due to the large amount of permanent differences in as compared to our net income before income tax expense 
year ended december  compared to year ended december overview of revenues and cost of goods sold total revenues increased from million in to million in revenue increases in our consumer  managed broadband and regulated operations segments were partially off set by decreases in our network access and commercial segments

a wireless line in service is defined as a revenue generating wireless device 
year to date average monthly consumer wireless revenues divided by the average of consumer wireless subscribers at the beginning and end of each month in the period 
consumer segment revenues the increase in voice revenue is primarily due to a million or increase in recognized support from the usac and an increase in monthly recurring local service fee revenue 
the increase in usac support is primarily due to an fcc order issued in march  the result of which provided uncapped support for all lines served by competitive etcs for tribal lands or alaska native regions retroactive to august the issuance of this order allowed us to recognize in  in additional usac support for services provided from august to december that is included in the revenue increase discussed above  and the removal of the cap allowed us to increase the usac support revenue that we recognized in the increase in monthly recurring local service fee revenue is due to increased subscribers 
the increase in voice revenue was partially offset by decreased long distance billable minutes carried 
the increase in video revenue is primarily due to the following a increase in programming services revenue to million in primarily resulting from an increase in digital programming tier subscribers in and a rate increase on certain cable service offerings beginning in august  and a increase in equipment rental revenue to million in primarily resulting from our customers increased use of our hd dvr converter boxes 
the increase in data revenue is primarily due to a increase in cable modem revenue to million due to increased subscribers and their selection of more value added features 
the increase in wireless revenue is primarily due to the following an million or increase in recognized support from the usac primarily due to the following o increased wireless subscribers in areas that receive usac support  o recognition of million to be received from the usac for interstate common line support for a new local access area for which we received etc status in may of which million was related to services provided during collectability was not reasonably assured until we were awarded etc status  therefore  we deferred revenue recognition until such status was confirmed  o recognition of million upon a change in our estimate of support to be received from the usac for interstate common line support of which  was related to we accrue estimated program revenue quarterly and adjust our revenue as we obtain new information that changes the variables used to calculate our estimate  and o the fcc order issued in march  the result of which provides uncapped support for all lines served by competitive etcs for tribal lands or alaska native regions retroactive to august the issuance of this order allowed us to recognize  in additional usac support from august to december in that is included in the revenue increase discussed above 
an increase in the number of wireless subscribers 
the increase in wireless revenue was partially off set by receipt of million in july from the usac for retroactive interstate common line support at alaska digitel for which revenue was recognized in consumer segment cost of goods sold the decrease in voice cost of goods sold is primarily due to cost savings resulting from the increased deployment of local access services dlps lines on our own facilities during and decreased voice minutes carried 
the video cost of goods sold increase is primarily due to increased channels offered to our subscribers  increased rates paid to programmers  increased costs associated with delivery of digital services offered over our hd dvr converter boxes due to the increased number of boxes in service  an increase in digital programming tier subscribers  and the recognition of a  charge in to settle a billing issue with a cable programmer 
the decrease in data cost of goods sold is primarily due to the transition of traffic to our own facilities from leased facilities and the addition of more peering partners for internet traffic  which was partially offset by an increase in costs due to an increased number of cable modem subscribers 
the increase in wireless cost of goods sold is primarily due to increased costs for wireless handset equipment sales associated with the increased number of wireless subscribers and the inclusion in certain promotions of premium wireless handsets which have higher costs 
the increase was partially offset by decreased costs due to the june  implementation of the new distribution agreement with at t mobility 
at t mobility acquired dobson  including its alaska properties  on november  in december we signed an agreement with at t mobility that provided for an orderly transition of our wireless customers from the dobson at t network in alaska to our wireless facilities that we began building in and substantially completed in the agreement required our customers to be on our wireless network by june   but allowed our customers to use the at t mobility network for roaming during the transition period 
we started transitioning our customers to our wireless facilities in november we successfully migrated all but customers from the at t mobility network to our network by the required transition date of june  the four year transition period  which expires june   provides us adequate time to replace the dobson at t network in alaska with our own wireless facilities 
under the agreement  at t mobility s obligation to purchase network services from us terminated as of july  at t mobility provided us with a large block of wireless network usage at no charge to facilitate the transition of our customers to our facilities 
we will pay for usage in excess of that base transitional amount 
under the previous agreement with dobson  our margin was fixed 
under the new agreement with at t mobility  we will pay for usage in excess of the block of no charge minutes on a per minute basis 
the block of wireless network usage at no charge has substantially reduced our wireless product cost of goods sold beginning june  through december  we expect this block of minutes to expire in the first half of at which time we expect a material increase to our wireless cost of goods sold estimated at million to million annually 
consumer segment adjusted ebitda the increase in adjusted ebitda is primarily due to increased revenue as described above in consumer segment revenues  which was partially offset by increased cost of goods sold as described above in consumer segment cost of goods sold and an increase in the selling  general and administrative expense that was allocated to our consumer segment primarily due to an increase in the segment margin upon which the allocation is based

the average rate per minute decrease is primarily due to a change in the composition of traffic and a interstate rate decrease mandated by federal law 
the decrease in data revenue is primarily due to a change in the composition of traffic resulting in iru operating leases and service agreements replacing data network service agreements 
the increase in wireless revenue is primarily due to increased roaming revenue in primarily due to the construction of our state wide gsm network starting in and the expansion of our cdma network 
network access segment cost of goods sold the decrease in voice cost of goods sold is primarily due to decreased long distance minutes carried and the movement of more traffic onto our network in lieu of carrying traffic on third party networks 
the decrease in data cost of goods sold is primarily due to a change in the composition of traffic resulting in iru operating leases and service agreements replacing data network service agreements and a  favorable adjustment resulting from a refund of fiber repair costs 
the fiber repair costs were originally recognized in the first quarter of due to the uncertainty surrounding the recovery of the fiber repair costs  we deferred recognition until collection of the refund was reasonably assured 
network access segment adjusted ebitda the adjusted ebitda decrease is primarily due to decreased revenue as described above in network access segment revenues  which is partially off set by decreased cost of goods sold as described above in network access segment cost of goods sold and a decrease in the selling  general and administrative expense that was allocated to our network access segment primarily due to a decrease in the segment margin upon which the allocation is based

commercial segment overview commercial segment revenue represented of consolidated revenues 
commercial segment data revenue is comprised of monthly recurring charges for data services and charges billed on a time and materials basis largely for personnel providing on site customer support 
this latter category can vary significantly based on project activity 
the components of commercial segment revenue are as follows amounts in thousands percentage change voice video data wireless total commercial segment revenue commercial segment cost of goods sold represented of consolidated cost of goods sold 
the components of commercial segment cost of goods sold are as follows amounts in thousands percentage change voice video data wireless total commercial segment cost of goods sold commercial segment adjusted ebitda  representing of consolidated adjusted ebitda  is as follows amounts in thousands percentage change commercial segment adjusted ebitda selected key performance indicators for our commercial segment follow december  percentage change voice long distance subscribers total local access lines in service local access lines in service on gci facilities long distance minutes carried in millions data cable modem subscribers wireless wireless lines in service a long distance subscriber is defined as a customer account that is invoiced a monthly long distance plan fee or has made a long distance call during the month 
a local access line in service is defined as a revenue generating circuit or channel connecting a customer to the public switched telephone network 
a cable modem subscriber is defined by the purchase of cable modem service regardless of the level of service purchased 
if one entity purchases multiple cable modem service access points  each access point is counted as a subscriber 
a wireless line in service is defined as a revenue generating wireless device 
commercial segment revenues the increase in voice revenue is primarily due to increased local access lines in service and a million or increase in recognized support from the usac primarily due to increased local subscribers and the fcc order issued in march  the result of which provides uncapped support for all lines served by competitive etcs for tribal lands or alaska native regions retroactive to august the issuance of this order allowed us to recognize  in additional usac support from august to december in that is included in the revenue increase discussed above 
the increase in voice revenue was partially off set by decreased long distance subscribers and decreased voice minutes carried 
the decrease in data revenue is primarily due to a million or decrease in managed services project revenue partially off set by a million or increase in internet revenue primarily due to an increase in cable modem subscribers 
the increase in wireless revenue is primarily due to an increase in the number of wireless subscribers 
commercial segment cost of goods sold the decrease in voice cost of goods sold is primarily due to cost savings resulting from an increase in local access lines in service on our own facilities during and decreased long distance billable minutes carried 
the decrease in data cost of goods sold is primarily due to a million or decrease in managed services project cost of goods sold 
commercial segment adjusted ebitda the adjusted ebitda increase was primarily due to decreased cost of goods sold as described above in commercial segment cost of goods sold that was partially offset by a decrease in revenue as described above in commercial segment revenues

selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in primarily due to the following a million increase in labor costs  million in additional expense resulting from our june   acquisition of uui and unicom  a million increase in our company wide success sharing bonus accrual in  million in additional expense incurred in for the conversion of our customers wireless phones to our facilities  and a million increase in lease related expense 
the increases were partially off set by the following a million decrease in contract labor costs  a million decrease in share based compensation expense primarily due to the reversal of expense properly recognized in previous periods for certain performance based stock options and restricted stock awards that were ultimately not expected to vest  and the absence of million to terminate a management agreement that was paid in upon the acquisition of our non controlling interest in alaska digitel 
as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in  primarily due to increasing revenue 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in the increase is primarily due to our million investment in equipment and facilities placed into service during for which a full year of depreciation was recorded in  and the million investment in equipment and facilities placed into service during the year ended december  for which a partial year of depreciation was recorded in the increase is partially off set by a million depreciation charge in to reflect a reduction of the estimated useful life of certain assets that were decommissioned at the end of other expense  net other expense  net of other income  increased to million in primarily due to the following a million decrease in capitalized interest in compared to million in additional interest expense resulting from the galaxy capital lease commencing in may  and a million increase in interest expense resulting from the write off of the original issue discount on our senior credit facility 
the interest expense increase is partially off set by the absence of a  loss that was recorded in relating to the fair value change on a derivative instrument 
income tax expense income tax expense totaled million and million in and  respectively 
our effective income tax rate increased from in to in primarily due to the increase in the amount of permanent differences in as compared to our pretax net income before income tax expense 
multiple system operator mso operating statistics our operating statistics include capital expenditures and customer information from our consumer and commercial segments which offer services utilizing our cable services facilities 
the standardized definition of a customer relationship is the number of customers that receive at least one level of service utilizing our cable service facilities  encompassing voice  video  and data services  without regard to which services customers purchase 
at december   and we had   and  customer relationships  respectively 
the standardized definition of a revenue generating unit is the sum of all primary analog video  digital video  high speed data  and telephony customers  not counting additional outlets 
at december   and we had   and  revenue generating units  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of current liquidity are cash and cash equivalents 
we believe  but can provide no assurances  that we will be able to meet our current and long term liquidity  capital requirements and fixed charges through our cash flows from operating activities  existing cash  cash equivalents  credit facilities  and other external financing and equity sources 
should operating cash flows be insufficient to support additional borrowings and principal payments scheduled under our existing credit facilities  capital expenditures will likely be reduced 
in january the us department of agriculture s rus approved our wholly owned subsidiary  uui application for an million loan grant combination to extend terrestrial broadband service for the first time to bristol bay and the yukon kuskokwim delta  an area in alaska roughly the size of the state of north dakota 
upon completion  terra sw will be able to serve over  households and over businesses in the covered communities 
the project will also be able to serve numerous public nonprofit private community anchor institutions and entities  such as regional health care providers  school districts  and other regional and alaska native organizations 
the rus award  consisting of a million loan and a million grant  will be made under the rus broadband initiatives program established pursuant to the american recovery and reinvestment act 
the award will fund backbone network facilities that we would not otherwise be able to construct within our return on investment requirements 
uui began construction on terra sw in and expects to complete the project in or earlier if possible 
while our short term and long term financing abilities are believed to be adequate as a supplement to internally generated cash flows to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions as opportunities arise  the state of the global financial markets may negatively impact our ability to further access the capital markets in a timely manner and on attractive terms  which may have a negative impact on our ability to grow our business 
we monitor the third party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents 
our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds 
our net cash flows provided by and used for operating  investing and financing activities  as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows for and  are summarized as follows amounts in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities the increase in cash flows provided by operating activities is due primarily to an increase in operating income in as compared to  a million decrease in accounts receivable that is due to timing of receipt of payments and a million contractually required payment made in investing activities net cash used in investing activities consists primarily of cash paid for capital expenditures 
our most significant recurring investing activity has been capital expenditures and we expect that this will continue in the future 
a significant portion of our capital expenditures is based on the level of customer growth and the technology being deployed 
the decrease in cash flows used for investing activities is due primarily to a decrease in spending for property and equipment  including construction in progress in partially off set by the final contingent payment of million for the alaska wireless acquisition 
our cash expenditures for property and equipment  including construction in progress  totaled million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
our capital expenditures decreased in primarily due to the decreased pace of our wireless network expansion 
we expect our expenditures for property and equipment for our core operations  including construction in progress  to total million to million  depending on available opportunities and the amount of cash flow we generate during  and excluding grant funded capital expenditures related to our terra sw project 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities consists primarily of our proceeds from borrowings off set by our debt repayments  payment of debt issuance costs and repurchases of our common stock 
proceeds from borrowings fluctuate from year to year based on our liquidity needs 
we may use excess cash to make optional repayments on our debt or repurchase our common stock depending on various factors  such as market conditions 
the decrease in cash flows provided by financing activities is due to a decrease in long term debt borrowings in compared to and an increase in repurchases of our common stock in compared to available borrowings under senior credit facility on january   we replaced our then existing senior credit facility with a new amended senior credit facility that provides a million revolving credit facility and that extends the maturity through january  we have a million revolving senior credit facility with a million sublimit for letters of credit 
we have million in long term debt and million of letters of credit outstanding  which leaves million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility as of december  on january   we repaid million of our outstanding long term debt 
on february   and february   we borrowed million and million  respectively  under our amended senior credit facility 
after consideration of these transactions  we have million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
debt covenants we are subject to covenants and restrictions set forth in the indentures governing our and notes  amended senior credit facility  rus loans  and cobank loans 
we are in compliance with the covenants  and we believe that neither the covenants nor the restrictions in our indentures or loan documents will limit our ability to operate our business 
share repurchases gci s board of directors has authorized a common stock buyback program for the repurchase of gci class a and class b common stock in order to reduce the outstanding shares of class a and class b common stock 
under this program  we are currently authorized to make up to million of repurchases as of december  we are authorized to increase our repurchase limit million per quarter indefinitely and to use stock option exercise proceeds to repurchase additional shares 
if stock repurchases are less than the total approved quarterly amount the difference may be carried forward and applied against future stock repurchases 
during the year ended december  we repurchased million shares of gci common stock at a cost of million 
all of the shares were retired in the common stock buyback program is expected to continue for an indefinite period dependent on leverage  liquidity  company performance  market conditions and subject to continued oversight by gci s board of directors 
the repurchases have and will continue to comply with the restrictions of sec rule b schedule of certain known contractual obligations the following table details future projected payments associated with certain known contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year to to more than years years years amounts in thousands long term debt interest on long term debt capital lease obligations  including interest operating lease commitments purchase obligations total contractual obligations long term debt listed in the table above includes principal payments on our amended senior credit facility  and notes  rural utilities services debt and cobank mortgage note payable 
interest on the amount outstanding under our amended senior credit facility is based on variable rates 
we used the current rate paid on the amended senior credit facility to estimate our future interest payments 
our notes require semi annual interest payments of million through february and our notes require semi annual interest payments of million through november our rural utilities services debt and cobank mortgage note payable have fixed interest rates ranging from to

capital lease obligations include our obligation to lease transponder capacity on galaxy for a discussion of our capital and operating leases  see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
purchase obligations include the following a non cancelable commitment to purchase hardware and software capable of providing wireless service to small markets in rural alaska of million  and cancelable open purchase orders for goods and services for capital projects and normal operations totaling million which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets at december   because the goods had not been received or the services had not been performed at december  off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources 
new accounting standards financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards update asu addresses the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit 
specifically  this guidance amends the criteria in subtopic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
this guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which is based on a vendor specific objective evidence  b third party evidence  or c estimates 
this guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
in addition  this guidance significantly expands required disclosures related to a vendor multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  the adoption of asu is not expected to have a material impact on our statement of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued asu intangibles goodwill and other topic when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
under asu  if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is zero or negative  an entity must assess whether it is more likely than not that goodwill impairment exists 
to make that determination  an entity should consider whether there are adverse qualitative factors that could impact the amount of goodwill  including those listed in asc as a result of the new guidance  an entity can no longer assert that a reporting unit is not required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test because the carrying amount of the reporting unit is zero or negative  despite the existence of qualitative factors that indicate goodwill is more likely than not impaired 
asu is effective for public entities for fiscal years  and for interim periods within those years  beginning after december   with early adoption prohibited 
the adoption of asu is not expected to have a material impact on our statement of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued the asu business combinations topic disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
asu specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the amendments in this update also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures under topic to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
the amended guidance is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of asu is not expected to have a material impact on our statement of operations  financial position or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting and reporting policies comply with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
the financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions  which are integral to understanding reported results 
critical accounting policies and estimates are those policies and estimates that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require management to make estimates that are difficult  subjective or complex 
most accounting policies and estimates are not considered by management to be critical 
several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy or estimate is critical in the preparation of financial statements 
these factors include  among other things  whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements  the nature of the estimates  the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including third parties or available prices  and sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under gaap 
for all of these policies and estimates  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
management has discussed the development and the selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee 
those policies and estimates considered to be critical for the years ended december  are described below 
revenue recognition the accounting estimates related to revenues from the high cost  rural health and schools and libraries usf programs are dependent on various inputs including current line counts  the most current rates paid to us  and our assessment of the impact of new fcc regulations  the potential outcome of fcc proceedings and the potential outcome of usac contract reviews 
some of the inputs are subjective and based on our judgment regarding the outcome of certain variables and are subject to upward or downward adjustment in subsequent periods 
significant changes to our estimates could result in material changes to the revenues we have recorded and could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful receivables we maintain allowances for doubtful receivables for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables based on notification that a customer may not have satisfactorily complied with rules necessary to obtain supplemental funding from the usac for services provided by us under our packaged communications offerings to rural hospitals  health clinics and school districts 
we base our estimates on the aging of our accounts receivable balances  financial health of specific customers  regional economic data  changes in our collections process  regulatory requirements  and our customers compliance with usac rules 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if they are unable to emerge from reorganization proceedings  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
if their financial condition improves or they emerge successfully from reorganization proceedings  allowances may be reduced 
such allowance changes could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
impairment and useful lives of intangible assets we had million of indefinite lived intangible assets at december  consisting of cable certificates of million  goodwill of million and wireless licenses of million 
our indefinite lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter and at any time upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances 
we are required to determine goodwill impairment using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be recognized in a business combination 
the impairment test for identifiable indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
our cable certificates are our largest indefinite lived intangible asset and represent agreements with government entities to construct and operate a cable business 
the value of our cable certificates is derived from the economic benefits we receive from the right to solicit new customers and to market new services 
the amount we have recorded for cable certificates is primarily from cable system acquisitions 
the cable certificates are valued under a direct discounted cash flow method whereby the cash flow associated with existing customers is isolated after appropriate contributory asset charges and then projected based on an analysis of customer churn and attrition characteristics 
our wireless licenses are from the fcc and give us the right to provide wireless service within a certain geographical area 
the amount we have recorded is from acquisitions of wireless companies and auctions of wireless spectrum 
we use comparable market transactions from recent fcc auctions  as appropriate  and a hypothetical build up method to value our wireless licenses 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition 
we use an income approach to determine the fair value of our reporting units for purposes of our goodwill impairment test 
in addition  a market based approach is used where possible to corroborate the fair values determined by the income approach 
the direct discounted cash flow  hypothetical build up  and income approach valuation methods require us to make estimates and assumptions including projected cash flows  discount rate  customer churn  and customer behaviors and attrition 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such impairment charge 
fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time  based on relevant information 
these estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision 
changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates 
events and factors that may be out of our control that could affect the estimates include such things as competitive forces  customer behaviors  change in revenue growth trends  cost structures and technology  and changes in discount rates  performance compared to peers  material and ongoing negative economic trends  and specific industry or market sector conditions 
our company is operated and managed with two balance sheets  however  our impairment tests must be performed at the reporting unit level  which requires us to allocate our balance sheet 
these allocations are subjective and require a significant amount of judgment 
changes to the assumptions and allocation methodologies could significantly change our estimates 
we may also record impairments in the future if there are changes in long term market conditions  expected future operating results  or laws and regulations that may prevent us from recovering the carrying value of our goodwill  cable certificates  and wireless licenses 
we have allocated all of the goodwill to our reporting units and based on our annual impairment test as of october   the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the book value by a range between and 
the reporting unit that exceeded the book value by passed the goodwill impairment test by million  which we believe is a large margin 
we believe none of our reporting units were close to failing step one of the goodwill impairment test 
based on our annual impairment test as of october   the fair value of our wireless licenses exceeded the book value by 
the fair value of our cable certificates exceeded the book value by and million as of october   which we believe is a large margin 
we believe that none of our indefinite lived intangible assets were close to failing the impairment test 
accruals for unbilled costs we estimate unbilled long distance and wireless services cost of goods sold based upon minutes of use carried through our network and established rates 
we estimate unbilled costs for new circuits and services  and network changes that result in traffic routing changes or a change in carriers 
carriers that provide service to us regularly make network changes that can lead to new  revised or corrected billings 
such estimates are revised or removed when subsequent billings are received  payments are made  billing matters are researched and resolved  tariffed billing periods lapse  or when disputed charges are resolved 
revisions to previous estimates could either increase or decrease costs in the year in which the estimate is revised which could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
valuation allowance for net operating loss deferred tax assets our income tax policy provides for deferred income taxes to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
we have recorded deferred tax assets of million associated with income tax net operating losses that were generated from to  and that primarily expire from to  and with charitable contributions that were converted to net operating losses in to  and that expire in to  respectively 
pre acquisition income tax net operating losses associated with acquired companies are subject to additional deductibility limits 
we have recorded deferred tax assets of million associated with alternative minimum tax credits that do not expire 
significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that may be required against the deferred tax assets 
we have not recorded a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets as of december  based on management s belief that future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and estimated future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards will  more likely than not  be sufficient to realize the benefit of these assets over time 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or if our historical trends change  we may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
regulatory developments see part i item business regulation for more information about regulatory developments affecting us 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has a significant effect on our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business  including the impact of interest rate changes 
we do not hold derivatives for trading purposes 
our amended senior credit facility carries interest rate risk 
amounts borrowed under this agreement bear interest at libor plus or less depending upon our total leverage ratio as defined 
should the libor rate change  our interest expense will increase or decrease accordingly 
as of december   we have borrowed million subject to interest rate risk 
on this amount  each increase in the libor interest rate would result in  of additional gross interest cost on an annualized basis
