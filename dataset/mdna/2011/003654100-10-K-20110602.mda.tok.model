these forward looking statements are subject to business and economic risks and uncertainties and our actual results of operations may differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed under item a risk factors as well as other risks and uncertainties referenced in this report 
overview we are a leading provider of medical devices in circulatory support and we offer a continuum of care in heart recovery to acute heart failure patients 
our products are designed to enable the heart to rest  heal and recover by improving blood flow and or performing the pumping function of the heart 
our products are used in the cardiac catheterization lab  or cath lab  by interventional cardiologists and or in the heart surgery suite by heart surgeons for patients who are in need of hemodynamic support prophelactically during high risk angioplasty procedures or who are in pre shock  shock or profound cardiogenic shock 
we believe heart recovery is the optimal clinical outcome by restoring the quality of life for patients 
in addition  we believe heart recovery is the most cost effective path for the healthcare system 
our strategic focus and the driver of the most recent revenue growth in our business is the market penetration of our impella product  which received k clearance in june in addition to the k clearance  we are also conducting clinical trials of our impella for additional indications of use  with the goal of establishing impella as the standard of care in the cath lab 
in december  we announced the termination of the protect ii study based on a futility determination at the planned interim analysis regarding the primary end point  which we view as likely to be due to how rotational atherectomy was used in the study 
in april  we announced final results from the protect ii study  including those patients enrolled post the initiation of the interim analysis  which showed a statistically significant reduction of in major adverse events compared to the intra aortic balloon at days per protocol 
we received k clearance in april for our impella and impella ld devices  which provide more blood flow than the impella in order for our manufacturing to meet the expected demand for our impella product  we have been implementing process improvements at our manufacturing facilities in aachen  germany  to increase the output that we can produce at the facility 
in addition to process improvement programs designed to further increase yield and capacity levels  we plan to incrementally expand manufacturing capacity in aachen and relocate selected impella sub assembly production to our manufacturing facility in danvers  massachusetts 
revenues from our other heart recovery products  largely focused on the heart surgery suite  decreased in fiscal as we continued to strategically focus our sales and marketing efforts towards our impella products in the cath lab 
we expect that sales from our non impella products will continue to decline as we dedicate the majority of our focus and resources on our impella products 
we have also developed a portable driver for our ab product which received fda approval under a pma supplement in march this clearance allows for commercial shipment of the device to us hospitals for in hospital and transport use 
the out of hospital use is being studied in a clinical trial to allow patients to go home while waiting for recovery 
our bvs product is years old and revenue from this product has been declining as ab  our next generation product for heart recovery  is designed to provide a longer duration of support than the bvs and facilitates patient mobility in the hospital 
we expect revenue from bvs to continue to decline as our customers transition more to ab disposables and our impella and ld products geared for the surgery suite 
we expect our revenues from our non impella business during fiscal will continue to decrease as we continue to focus on our impella products 
we do not expect revenues from sales of our replacement heart product  the abiocor  will be a material portion of our total revenues for the foreseeable future as our primary strategic focus is centered on heart recovery for acute heart failure patients 
we did not recognize any abiocor revenue during fiscal  or we have incurred annual net losses since our inception  including net losses of million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
we expect to incur additional net losses in the future as we continue to invest in research and development expenses related to our products  conduct clinical studies and registries on our products  and expand our commercial infrastructure 
our financial condition was bolstered by our public offering in august  which yielded us approximately million in net proceeds after deducting offering expenses 
we expect that our existing cash resources  together with our revenues  will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next fiscal year 
critical accounting policies and estimates significant estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventories  impairment of intangible assets and goodwill  financial instruments  accrued expenses  income taxes including the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  stock based compensation  valuation of long lived assets  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimated 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when evidence of an arrangement exists  title has passed generally upon shipment or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sales to new customers is deferred until all elements of the sale have been delivered 
all costs related to product shipment are recognized at time of shipment 
we do not provide for rights of return to customers on our product sales and therefore do not record a provision for returns 
maintenance and service support contract revenues are included in product revenue and are recognized ratably over the term of the service contracts based upon the elapsed term of the service contract 
revenue is recognized as it is earned in limited instances where we rent console medical devices to customers on a month to month basis or for a longer specified period of time 
government sponsored research and development contracts and grants generally provide for payment on a cost plus fixed fee basis 
revenues from these contracts and grants are recognized as work is performed  provided the government has appropriated sufficient funds for the work 
under contracts in which we elect to spend significantly more on the development project during the term of the contract than the total contract amount  we prospectively recognize revenue on such contracts ratably over the term of the contract as related research and development costs are incurred 
goodwill and intangible assets we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually using forecasts of discounted future cash flows 
estimates of future cash flows require assumptions related to revenue and operating income growth  asset related expenditures  working capital levels and other factors 
different assumptions from those made in our analysis could materially affect projected cash flows and our evaluation of goodwill for impairment 
should the fair value of goodwill decline because of reduced operating performance  market declines  delays in regulatory approval  other indicators of impairment  or as a result of changes in the discount rate  charges for impairment of goodwill may be necessary 
we performed our annual impairment review for fiscal as of october  and determined that no write down for impairment of goodwill was required as the fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying value 
the carrying amount of goodwill at march  was million 
we estimate the fair value of acquisition related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses 
the projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition 
we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include significant changes relative to i projected future operating results  ii the use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  iii business collaborations  and iv industry  business  or economic trends and developments 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded value of the asset 
if it is determined that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value on a discounted cash flow basis 
the net book value of intangible assets at march  was million 
stock based compensation we record stock based compensation in our statements of operations based on the fair value method 
this expense is determined after consideration of several significant judgments and estimates  including the probable outcome for awards with a performance condition or conditions 
the fair value of stock option grants is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a term consistent with the expected life of the stock options 
volatility assumptions are calculated based on historical volatility of our stock 
the calculation of the fair value of the options is net of estimated forfeitures 
the expected term of options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
we estimated the average expected life based on historical experience of our option exercises 
forfeitures are estimated based on an analysis of actual option forfeitures  adjusted to the extent historic forfeitures may not be indicative of forfeitures in the future 
in addition  an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the option valuation model because we do not pay dividends and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future 
the estimated fair value of all awards is recognized as compensation expense on a straight line basis over the service period 
accruals of compensation cost for an award with a performance condition are based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions 
the cumulative effects of changes in the probability outcomes are recorded in the period in which the changes occur 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu no 
 which amended fasb accounting standard codification subtopic this amended guidance requires an entity to allocate revenue to each unit of accounting in multiple deliverable arrangements based on the relative selling price of each deliverable 
it also changes the level of evidence required to separate deliverables by requiring an entity to make its best estimate of the stand alone selling price of the deliverables with more objective evidence if the selling price is not available 
previously we were required to have objective evidence of the undelivered items in order to have separate units of accounting for multiple element arrangements 
this new approach is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   which for us means no later than april  early adoption is permitted  however  adoption of this guidance as of a date other than april   would have required us to apply this guidance retrospectively effective as of april  and required disclosure of the effect of this guidance as applied to all previously reported interim periods in the fiscal year of adoption 
we did not elect to early adopt this amended guidance and do not expect the adoption of this new guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenues which includes revenues from products and funded research and development year ended march  revenues product funded research and development total revenues costs and expenses cost of product revenue research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets total costs and expenses loss from operations other income expense investment income expense  net gain on sale of worldheart stock other expense  net loss before income tax provision income tax provision net loss fiscal years ended march  and march  fiscal and fiscal revenue our revenues are comprised of the following year ended march  in s impella products other products total product revenues funded research and development total revenues product revenues for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal the increase in product revenue was primarily due to an increase in impella revenue due to greater demand in the us for the impella and  offset by a decrease in our other non impella revenue  primarily related to bvs and ab impella product revenues for fiscal increased by million  or to million from million for fiscal most of our impella revenue was from disposable product sales of impella as we focus on increasing utilization of impella through continued sales force and physician training 
we have also generated sales of impella and impella ld in the us in fiscal through the expansion of these applications in the surgery suite following k clearance for these products received in april other product revenues for fiscal decreased by million or  to million from million for fiscal the decrease in other revenue was due to a decrease in bvs and ab disposable revenue as well as a decrease in console revenue supporting these product lines 
we expect that bvs and ab revenue will continue to decline in fiscal as we focus our sales efforts in the surgical suite on impella and ld 
cost of product revenue cost of product revenue for fiscal decreased by million or  to million from million for fiscal gross margin for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher reorders of impella product disposable pumps  improved manufacturing efficiency and a lower amount of console placements as we reduced the number of new site openings in fiscal research and development expenses research and development expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to higher clinical trial activity expenditures 
research and development expenses for fiscal and included million and million  respectively  in clinical trial expenses primarily associated with our impella us trials 
we expect research and development spending to increase slightly in fiscal as we compile data and incur costs to close the protect ii trial and continue to invest in research on new products 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to investments in marketing initiatives and commercial infrastructure to support the expansion of the impella platform 
we expect to continue to increase our expenditures on sales and marketing activities in fiscal  with particular investments in clinical personnel with cath lab expertise and we also plan to increase our marketing  service and training investments to support the efforts of the sales and field clinical teams to drive recovery awareness for acute heart failure patients 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangible assets decreased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal amortization primarily relates to specifically identified assets from the impella acquisition 
gain on sale of worldheart stock in december  we made a million investment in worldheart  a developer of an implantable mechanical circulatory support system for chronic heart failure patients 
we recorded an impairment charge of million in fiscal  reducing the carrying value of the investment to zero 
in july  the note receivable and warrant were converted into common stock of worldheart 
in fiscal we sold  shares of worldheart common stock  which resulted in a gain of million 
in fiscal we sold our remaining  shares of worldheart common stock  which resulted in a gain of million 
income tax provision during fiscal and  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million and million  respectively 
the income tax provision is primarily due to a deferred tax liability related to a difference in accounting for our goodwill  which is amortizable over years for tax purposes but not amortized for book purposes 
the net deferred tax liability cannot be offset against our deferred tax assets since it relates to an indefinite lived asset and is not anticipated to reverse in the same period 
the increase in income tax expense in fiscal was due to a lower refundable research and development credit received in fiscal as compared to fiscal net loss during fiscal  we incurred a net loss of million  or per share compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in the net loss in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to increased impella sales as a result of our focus on increasing impella utilization in the us we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future as we plan to invest in expanding our global distribution to support revenue growth and as we invest in research and development to bring enhancements to impella and continue research on new products 
fiscal years ended march  and march  fiscal and fiscal revenue our revenues are comprised of the following year ended march  in s impella products other products total product revenues funded research and development total revenues product revenues for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal the increase in product revenue was primarily due to an increase in impella revenue due to greater demand in the us of the impella  offset by a decrease in our other non impella revenue  primarily related to bvs and ab impella product revenues for fiscal increased by million  or to million from million for fiscal most of our impella revenue was from disposable product sales of impella  primarily as a result of sales occurring after our k clearance in june  as we focus on increasing utilization of impella through continued sales force and physician training 
we have also generated sales of impella and impella ld in the us in fiscal following k clearance received in april other product revenues for fiscal decreased by million or  to million from million for fiscal the decrease in other revenue was due to a decrease in bvs and ab disposable revenue as well as a decrease in console revenue supporting these product lines 
cost of product revenues cost of product revenues for fiscal increased by million or  to million from million for fiscal this was due to shipments of higher volumes of impella disposable products in fiscal gross margin for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher reorders of impella disposables and lower amount of impella and ipulse console placements 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal the increase in research and development expenses was due to higher clinical trial activity and impella program spending on product enhancements to impella during fiscal research and development expenses for fiscal and included million and million  respectively  in clinical trial expenses primarily associated with our impella and us trials 
the increase in product development costs reflects our efforts to expand and enhance our product lines  particularly impella  across a clinical spectrum of circulatory care 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal the increase is primarily due to investments in marketing initiatives and commercial infrastructure to support the launch and expansion of the impella platform 
amortization of intangibles amortization of intangible assets was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal amortization primarily relates to specifically identified assets from the impella acquisition 
investment expense and income  net investment income  net  was million for fiscal  representing an increase of million from investment expense of million for fiscal the increase in investment income for fiscal was due to improvements in the fair value of our columbia fund investment that allowed us to recover a portion of the unrealized losses previously incurred on our investment in the columbia fund 
gain on sale of worldheart stock in december  we entered into an agreement in which we made a million investment in worldheart  a developer of an implantable mechanical circulatory support system for chronic heart failure patients 
we recorded an impairment charge of million in fiscal  reducing the carrying value of the investment to zero 
in july  the note receivable and warrant were converted into common stock of worldheart 
in december  we sold  shares of worldheart common stock  which  as a result of our basis having been reduced to zero  resulted in a gain of million that was recorded during fiscal in february and march  we sold  shares of worldheart common stock  which resulted in a gain of million 
income tax provision during fiscal and  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million and million  respectively 
the income tax provision is primarily due to a deferred tax liability related to a difference in accounting for our goodwill  which is amortizable over years for tax purposes but not amortized for book purposes 
the net deferred tax liability cannot be offset against our deferred tax assets since it relates to an indefinite lived asset and is not anticipated to reverse in the same period 
the decrease in income tax expense in fiscal is due to a refundable research and development tax credit we received in january net loss during fiscal  we incurred a net loss of million  or per share compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in the net loss in fiscal compared to fiscal is due primarily to increased impella sales as a result of our focus on increasing impella utilization in the us and a million gain from the sale of worldheart stock in fiscal liquidity and capital resources at march   our cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities totaled million  an increase of million compared to million in cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities at march  in august  we completed a public offering in which we received net proceeds of million 
we believe that our revenue from product sales together with existing resources will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
marketable securities at march  include million held in funds that invest solely in us treasury securities 
we are not a party to any interest rate swaps  currency hedges or derivative contracts of any type and have no exposure to commercial paper or auction rate securities markets 
we continue to monitor our cash position closely with recent economic events and only invest excess cash in short term us treasury securities 
we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the overall health of the credit markets 
however  we cannot predict with any certainty the impact on us of any further disruption in the credit environment 
our primary liquidity needs are to fund the expansion of our commercial infrastructure in the us  increase our impella manufacturing capacity  fund new product development  and general working capital needs 
through march   we have funded our operations principally from product sales and through the sale of equity securities  including our august stock offering in which we received proceeds of million 
we also generate funds from government funded research and development revenue 
our operating activities during the year ended march  provided cash of million as compared to a use of cash of million during the prior year 
our net loss for the year ended march  was million and our accounts receivable and inventories increased by million during fiscal the uses of cash were offset by non cash expenses of million related to stock based compensation expense  million of depreciation and amortization  and million in write downs of inventory during fiscal additionally  accounts payable  accrued expenses  and deferred revenue increased by million in fiscal our investing activities during the year ended march  used cash of million as compared to million provided during the prior year 
cash used by investment activities for the year ended march  consisted primarily of million in cash expenditures for property and equipment primarily related to computer software projects and manufacturing equipment 
we also had net purchases of million of short term marketable securities in fiscal as we were able to primarily fund our activities from operating cash flows 
partially offsetting the use of cash was million in proceeds from the sale of worldheart stock in fiscal our financing activities during the year ended march  provided cash of million as compared to million during the prior year 
cash provided by financing activities for fiscal were attributable to the exercise of stock options and proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan 
capital expenditures for fiscal are estimated to be to million  which relate primarily to our planned manufacturing capacity increases for impella and software development projects 
our liquidity is influenced by our ability to sell our products in a competitive industry and our customers ability to pay for our products 
factors that may affect liquidity include our ability to penetrate the market for our products  maintain or reduce the length of the selling cycle  and collect cash from clients after our products are sold 
exclusive of activities involving any future acquisitions of products or companies that complement or augment our existing line of products  we believe that current available funds and cash generated from operations will provide sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements for the foreseeable future 
we believe that our existing cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected capital expenditures  working capital  and other cash requirements at least through the next months 
we continue to review our long term cash needs on a regular basis 
at march   we had no debt outstanding 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at march  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by fiscal year in s total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations operating lease commitments contractual obligations total obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and expected liabilities under agreements with third parties  primarily for research and development activities  such as clinical trials 
we have no long term debt  capital leases or other material commitments for open purchase orders and clinical trial agreements at march  other than those shown in the table above 
our operating lease for our facility in danvers  massachusetts expires on february  monthly rent is as follows the base rent for november through june was  per month  the base rent for july through february is  per month  and the base rent for march through february will be  per month 
in addition  we have certain rights to terminate the lease early  subject to the payment of a specified termination fee based on the timing of the termination  as further outlined in the amendment 
we have a lease for our european headquarters in aachen  germany 
the lease payments are approximately  euro approximately us  per month and the lease term expires in december in july  we entered into a lease agreement providing for the lease of a  square foot manufacturing facility in athlone  ireland 
the lease agreement was for a term of years and one week  commencing on july  the monthly rent due under the lease agreement and payable monthly was  euro approximately us  per month through april  we relocated the production equipment from our athlone  ireland manufacturing facility to our aachen and danvers facilities and fully vacated the athlone facility in the first quarter of fiscal in march  we terminated our lease agreement and paid a termination fee of approximately million as a result of the early termination 
we apply the disclosure provisions of guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including guarantees of indebtedness of others  to our agreements that contain guarantee or indemnification clauses 
these disclosure provisions require that guarantors disclose certain types of guarantees  even if the likelihood of requiring the guarantor s performance is remote 
the following is a description of arrangements in which we are a guarantor 
we enter into agreements with other companies in the ordinary course of business  typically with underwriters  contractors  clinical sites and customers that include indemnification provisions 
under these provisions we generally indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of our activities 
these indemnification provisions generally survive termination of the underlying agreement 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited 
we have never incurred any material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements 
as a result  the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these agreements at march  clinical study agreements in our clinical study agreements  we have agreed to indemnify the participating institutions against losses incurred by them for claims related to any personal injury of subjects taking part in the study to the extent they relate to use of our devices in accordance with the clinical study agreement  the protocol for the device and our instructions 
the indemnification provisions contained within our clinical study agreements do not generally include limits on the claims 
we have never incurred any material costs related to the indemnification provisions contained in our clinical study agreements 
product warranties we accrue for estimated future warranty costs on our product sales at the time of shipment 
all of our products are subject to rigorous regulation and quality standards 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates 
our operating results could be adversely affected if the actual cost of product failures exceeds the estimated warranty provision 
patent indemnifications in many sales transactions  we indemnify customers against possible claims of patent infringement caused by our products 
the indemnifications contained within sales contracts usually do not include limits on the claims 
we have never incurred any material costs to defend lawsuits or settle patent infringement claims related to sales transactions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk primary market risk exposures our cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at march   we believe the decline in fair market value of our investment portfolio would be immaterial 
marketable securities at march  consist of million in five funds that invest in us treasury securities and related interest 
currency exchange rates our foreign subsidiaries functional currency is the euro 
therefore  our investment in our subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on our net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity 
had a depreciation in the euro occurred relative to the us dollar as of march   the result would have been a reduction of stockholders equity of approximately million 
fair value of financial instruments our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  and short term marketable securities  accounts receivable  and accounts payable 
the estimated fair values of the financial instruments have been determined by us using available market information and appropriate valuation techniques 
considerable judgment is required  however  to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we could realize in a current market exchange 
the use of different market assumptions and or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts
