critical accounting policies we consider our accounting policies related to revenue recognition  share based compensation  business combinations  goodwill  identifiable intangible assets  and income taxes to be critical policies in understanding our historical and future performance 
revenue recognition we have agreements with clients pursuant to which we deliver various services each month 

table of contents following is a description of significant sources of revenue fees contingent upon the month to month delivery of case management services defined by client contracts  such as claims processing  claims reconciliation  professional services  call center support  disbursement services  project management  collection and forensic services  document review services  and conversion of data into an organized  searchable electronic database 
the amount we earn varies based on the size and complexity of the engagement  the number of hours services are provided  and the number of documents or amount of data reviewed 
hosting fees based on the amount of data stored 
deposit based fees  earned primarily based on a percentage of chapter total liquidated assets placed on deposit with a designated financial institution by our trustee clients  to whom we provide  at no charge  software licenses  limited hardware and hardware maintenance  and postcontract customer support services 
the fees we earn are based on total liquidated assets placed on deposit by our trustee clients and may vary based on fluctuations in short term interest rates 
legal noticing services to parties of interest in bankruptcy and class action matters  including direct notification  media campaign  and advertising management in which we coordinate notification through various media outlets  such as print  radio and television  to potential parties of interest for a particular client engagement 
reimbursement for costs incurred  primarily related to postage on mailing services 
monitoring and noticing fees earned based on monthly or on demand requests for information provided through our aacer software product 
non software arrangements services related to ediscovery and settlement administration are billed based on volume 
for these contractual arrangements  we have identified each deliverable service element 
based on our evaluation of each element  we have determined that each element delivered has standalone value to our customers because we or other vendors sell such services separately from any other services deliverables 
we have also obtained objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of each element based either on the price we charge when we sell an element on a standalone basis or based on third party evidence of fair value of such similar services 
lastly  our arrangements do not include general rights of return 
accordingly  each of the service elements in our multiple element case and document management arrangements qualifies as a separate unit of accounting 
we allocate revenue to the various units of accounting in our arrangements based on the fair value of each unit of accounting  which is generally consistent with the stated prices in our arrangements 
as we have evidence of an arrangement  revenue for each separate unit of accounting is recognized each period 
revenue is recognized as the services are rendered  our fee becomes fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
payments received in advance of satisfaction of the related revenue recognition criteria are recognized as a customer deposit until all revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 
software arrangements for our chapter bankruptcy trustee arrangements  we provide our trustee clients with a software license  hardware lease  hardware maintenance  and postcontract customer support services  all at no charge to the trustee 
the trustees place their liquidated estate deposits with a financial institution with which we have an arrangement 
we earn contingent monthly fees from the financial institutions based on the dollar level of average monthly deposits held by the trustees with that financial institution related to the software license  hardware lease  hardware maintenance  and postcontract customer support services 
since we have not established vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of 
table of contents the software license  we do not recognize any revenue on delivery of the software 
the software element is deferred and included with the remaining undelivered elements  which are postcontract customer support services 
this revenue  when recognized  is included as a component of case management services revenue 
revenue related to postcontract customer support is entirely contingent on the placement of liquidated estate deposits by the trustee with the financial institution 
accordingly  we recognize this contingent usage based revenue as the fee becomes fixed or determinable at the time actual usage occurs and collectability is probable 
this occurs monthly as a result of the computation  billing and collection of monthly deposit fees contractually agreed to 
at that time  we have also satisfied the other revenue recognition criteria since we have persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we also provide our trustee clients with certain hardware  such as desktop computers  monitors  and printers  and hardware maintenance 
we retain ownership of all hardware provided and we account for this hardware as a lease 
as the hardware maintenance arrangement is an executory contract similar to an operating lease  we use guidance related to contingent rentals in operating lease arrangements for hardware maintenance as well as for the hardware lease 
since the payments under all of our arrangements are contingent upon the level of trustee deposits and the delivery of upgrades and other services  and there remain important uncertainties regarding the amount of unreimbursable costs yet to be incurred by us  we account for the hardware lease as an operating lease 
therefore  all lease payments  based on the estimated fair value of hardware provided  were accounted for as contingent rentals  which requires that we recognize rental income when the changes in the factor on which the contingent lease payment is based actually occur 
this occurs at the end of each period as we achieve our target when deposits are held at the depository financial institution as  at that time  evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the amount has become fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
this revenue  which is less than ten percent of our total revenue for the years ended december   and  is included in the consolidated statements of income as a component of case management services revenue 
reimbursements we have revenue related to the reimbursement of certain costs  primarily postage 
reimbursed postage and other reimbursable direct costs are recorded gross in the consolidated statements of income as operating revenue from reimbursed direct costs and as reimbursed direct costs 
share based compensation we measure compensation cost for share based awards at fair value and recognize the expense as compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest 
to date  the share based compensation awards we have issued are stock option and nonvested share awards also referred to as restricted stock awards 
we are required to estimate the share based awards that we ultimately expect to vest and to reduce share based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period 
although we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience  actual forfeitures in the future may differ 
in addition  to the extent our actual forfeitures are different than our estimates  we record a true up for the difference in the period that the awards vest  and such true ups could affect our operating results 
we estimate the fair value of employee stock options using a black scholes valuation model 
the fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant  as well as other assumptions including the expected volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards  the estimated period of time that we expect the stock options will be held  the expected risk free interest rate  and the expected dividend rate 

table of contents we estimate our expected volatility based on implied volatilities from traded options on our stock and on our stock historical volatility based on daily stock prices 
we have estimated the expected term of our stock options based on the historical exercise pattern of groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior 
the expected risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant 
the fair value of nonvested share awards is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock 
we record deferred tax assets for share based awards that potentially result in deductions on our income tax returns 
we estimate the deferred tax asset based on the amount of share based compensation recognized and the statutory tax rate in the jurisdictions in which we will receive a tax deduction 
because the deferred tax asset we record is based upon the share based compensation expense in a particular jurisdiction  the aforementioned inputs that affect the fair value of our stock awards also indirectly affect our income tax expense 
in addition  differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax returns are recorded in additional paid in capital 
if the tax deduction is less than the deferred tax asset  such shortfalls reduce our pool of excess tax benefits 
if the pool of excess tax benefits is reduced to zero  then subsequent shortfalls would increase our income tax expense 
recognition of share based compensation expense has had  and will likely continue to have  a material effect on our direct cost of services and general and administrative line items within our consolidated statements of income  and also may have a material effect on our deferred income taxes and additional paid in capital line items within our consolidated balance sheets 
for additional information see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
business combination accounting we have acquired a number of businesses in the past  and we may acquire additional businesses in the future 
business combination accounting requires us to determine the fair value of all assets acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  liabilities assumed  and contingent consideration issued in a business combination 
the cost of the acquisition is allocated to these assets and liabilities in amounts equal to the estimated fair value of each asset and liability  and any remaining acquisition cost is classified as goodwill 
this allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including quoted market prices and estimates of future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets 
acquisition related costs for potential and completed acquisitions are expensed  as incurred  and are included in other operating expense in our consolidated statements of income 
determining the fair value of contingent consideration issued requires an assessment of the projected revenue over the earn out period  and applying an appropriate discount rate based upon the weighted average cost of capital 
this fair value assessment is also required in periods subsequent to a business combination 
such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
certain identifiable intangible assets  such as customer lists and covenants not to compete  are amortized based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed over the intangible asset estimated economic benefit period  generally from five to ten years 
goodwill is not amortized 
accordingly  the acquisition cost allocation has had  and will continue to have  a significant impact on our current operating results 
goodwill goodwill consists of the excess of cost of acquired enterprises over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
we assess goodwill for impairment on 
table of contents an annual basis at a reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is a component of a segment that constitutes a business  for which discrete financial information is available  and for which the operating results are regularly reviewed by management 
we have determined that our reporting units are bankruptcy trustee management  corporate restructuring  ediscovery  and settlement administration 
goodwill is assessed between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  a change in strategic direction  legal factors  operating performance indicators  a change in the competitive environment  the sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit  or future economic factors such as unfavorable changes in our stock price and market capitalization or unfavorable changes in the estimated future discounted cash flows of our reporting units 
our annual test is performed as of july each year  and there have been no events since the annual test to indicate that it is more likely than not that the recorded goodwill balance had become impaired 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
we considered both a market approach and an income approach in order to develop an estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit for purposes of our annual impairment test 
when evaluating the market approach  we determined that directly comparable publicly traded companies did not exist  primarily due to the unique business model characteristics and projected growth of each reporting unit 
instead  we utilized a discounted projected future cash flow analysis income approach to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
potential impairment is indicated when the carrying value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  exceeds its estimated fair value 
this analysis requires significant judgments  including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business  estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur  and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
in addition  financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital  used to determine our discount rate  and through our stock price  used to determine our market capitalization 
we may be required to recognize impairment of goodwill based on future economic factors such as unfavorable changes in our stock price and market capitalization or unfavorable changes in the estimated future discounted cash flows of our reporting units 
if we determine that the estimated fair value of any reporting unit is less than the reporting unit carrying value  then we proceed to the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis to measure the potential impairment charge 
an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value 
if goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet becomes impaired during a future period  the resulting impairment charge could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
due to the current economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact that future economic impacts will have on our reporting units  there can be no assurances that our estimates and assumptions regarding the duration of the economic recession  or the period or strength of recovery  made for purposes of our annual goodwill impairment test  will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if our assumptions regarding forecasted revenues or margins of certain of our reporting units are not achieved  we may be required to record goodwill impairment losses in future periods 
it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment loss would occur  and if it does occur  whether such charge would be material 
our recognized goodwill totaled million as of december  as of july   which is the date of our most recent impairment test  the fair value of each of our reporting units was 
table of contents substantially in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit  except for the bankruptcy trustee management reporting unit  which had million of goodwill allocated to it 
the fair value of this reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 
the discount rate used in the income approach for the trustee management reporting unit  evaluated at july   was 
an increase to the discount rate of would have lowered the fair value determined under the income approach for this reporting unit by approximately million  or  which  with all other variables remaining the same  would result in the fair value of this reporting unit exceeding its carrying value by 
in connection with the acquisition of jupiter esources llc on october   as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we recognized million of goodwill  which is allocated to the bankruptcy segment 
identifiable intangible assets identifiable intangible assets  resulting from various business acquisitions  consist of customer relationships  agreements not to compete  and trade names 
our customer relationships  agreements not to compete  and one of our trade name intangible assets have finite lives  and are amortized over their estimated economic benefit period  generally from five to ten years 
these definite lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment and also reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances have indicated that the carrying amount of these assets might not be recoverable 
if we were to determine that events and circumstances warrant a change to the estimate of an identifiable intangible asset remaining useful life  then the remaining carrying amount of the identifiable intangible asset would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life 
additionally  information resulting from our annual assessment  or other events and circumstances  may indicate that the carrying value of one or more identifiable intangible assets is not recoverable which would result in recognition of an impairment charge 
our trade name identifiable intangible asset recognized in connection with the acquisition of jupiter esources llc was determined to have an indefinite life 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized and are tested annually for impairment and also reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset might not be recoverable 
impairment of identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives occurs when the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount 
if impaired  the asset carrying amount is reduced to its fair value 
a change in the estimate of the remaining life of one or more identifiable intangible assets or the impairment of one or more identifiable intangible assets could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
our identifiable intangible assets carrying value  net of amortization  was million as of december  income taxes a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized for the anticipated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income and  if necessary  execution of our tax planning strategies 
in the event we determine that sufficient future taxable income  taking into consideration tax planning strategies  may not generate sufficient taxable income to fully realize net deferred tax assets  we may be required to establish or increase valuation allowances by a charge to income tax expense in the period such a determination is made 
this charge may have a material impact on recognized income tax expense on our consolidated statements of income 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a 
table of contents change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the recognition of a change in enacted tax rates may have a material impact on recognized income tax expense and on our consolidated statements of income 
we follow accounting guidance which prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under this guidance  tax positions are initially recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
such tax positions are initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
application of this guidance requires numerous estimates based on available information 
we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits  and our recognized tax positions and tax benefits may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
as we obtain additional information  we may need to periodically adjust our recognized tax positions and tax benefits 
these periodic adjustments may have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income 
for additional information related to uncertain tax positions see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued updated guidance that requires entities to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers 
in addition  the update requires entities to present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level 
the disclosures related to level and level fair value measurements are effective for us in the update required new disclosures only  and had no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows as we have not had any transfers out of level the disclosures related to level fair value measurements are effective for us in this update also only requires new disclosures  and will have no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in october  the fasb issued new standards for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables 
these new standards require entities to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of the delivered goods and services based on a selling price hierarchy 
the amendments eliminate the residual method of revenue allocation and require revenue to be allocated using the relative selling price method 
these new standards are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year  however early adoption is permitted 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued new standards for the accounting for certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
these new standards amend the scope of pre existing software revenue guidance by removing from the guidance non software components of tangible products and certain software components of tangible products 
these new standards are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year  however early adoption is permitted 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as our software arrangements are not tangible products with software components 
in december  the fasb issued new standards that amend the criteria for performing step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts and requires performing step if qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
we will adopt this guidance in fiscal year we do not anticipate the adoption of 
table of contents this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as we do not have any reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts as of our last impairment test 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks to which we are exposed include interest rates under our senior revolving credit facility  foreign exchange rates giving rise to translation  and fluctuations in short term interest rates on a portion of our bankruptcy trustee revenue 
interest rate risk interest on our senior revolving credit facility is generally based on a spread  not to exceed basis points over the libor rate 
as of december   we had borrowed million under the senior revolving loan 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical basis point movement in interest rates applied to the average daily borrowings of the senior revolving loan 
as of december   the analysis indicated that such a movement would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in our chapter bankruptcy business we earn deposit based fees 
these fees are earned primarily on a percentage of chapter total liquidated assets placed on deposit with a designated financial institution by our trustee clients 
the fees we earn based on total liquidated assets placed on deposit by our trustee clients may vary based on fluctuations in short term interest rates 
we currently do not hold any interest rate floor options or other derivatives 
foreign currency risk we have operations outside of the united states  therefore  a portion of our revenues and expenses are incurred in a currency other than us dollars 
we do not utilize hedge instruments to manage the exposures associated with fluctuating currency exchange rates 
our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the functional currency of the countries where we have operations 
when the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the dollar value of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies increases 
when the us dollar strengthens  the opposite situation occurs
