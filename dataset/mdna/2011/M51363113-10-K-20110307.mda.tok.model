item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly in the section entitled risk factors 
overview general we are a leading fabless semiconductor company that produces and supplies high performance connectivity products which facilitate efficient data transmission between servers  communications infrastructure equipment and storage systems 
we design  develop and market adapter  gateway and switch ics  all of which are silicon devices that provide high performance connectivity 
we also offer a complete line of adapter cards that incorporate our adapter ics  and switch and gateway system product lines that incorporate our switch and gateway ics 
our end to end products  including adapter  gateway and switch ics  adapter cards  switch systems  gateway systems and cables are an integral part of a total networking solution focused on computing  storage and communication applications used in enterprise data centers  high performance computing and embedded systems 
we are one of the pioneers of infiniband  an industry standard architecture that provides specifications for high performance interconnects 
we believe we are the leading supplier of field proven infiniband compliant semiconductor products that deliver industry leading performance and capabilities  which is demonstrated by the performance  efficiency and scalability of clustered computing and storage systems that incorporate our products 
in addition to supporting infiniband  our products also support the industry standard ethernet interconnect specification and provide unique product differentiation and connectivity flexibility 
our adapters provide bandwidth up to gb s single data rate or sdr ethernet or infiniband  gb s double data rate or ddr infiniband and gb s quad data rate or qdr ethernet or infiniband and our switch ics provide bandwidth up to gb s per interface 
our switch systems based on our switch ics range in port size and density from top of rack port switches through director class port switches 
we outsource our manufacturing  assembly  packaging and production test functions  which enables us to focus on the design  development  sales and marketing of our products 
as a result  our business has relatively low capital requirements 
however  our ability to bring new products to market  fulfill customer orders and achieve long term growth depends on our ability to maintain sufficient technical personnel and obtain sufficient external subcontractor capacity 
we have experienced growth in our total revenues in each of the last three years 
our revenues increased from million for the year ended december  to million to million to million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in order to increase our annual revenues  we must continue to achieve design wins over other infiniband and ethernet providers and providers of competing interconnect technologies 
we consider a design win to occur when an original equipment manufacturer  or oem  or contract manufacturer notifies us that it has selected our products to be incorporated into a product or system under development 
because the life cycles for our customers products can last for several years if these products have successful commercial introductions  we expect to continue to generate revenues over an extended period of time for each successful design win 

table of contents on february  we completed acquisition of voltaire for million in cash 
in addition we assumed all of voltaire outstanding options held by employees  which were converted into equity awards to acquire an aggregate of  ordinary shares of mellanox 
an element of our business strategy involves the acquisition of businesses  assets  products and technologies that allow us to reduce the time or costs required to develop new technologies and products and bring them to market  incorporate enhanced functionality into and complement our existing product offerings  augment our engineering workforce  and enhance our technological capabilities 
we plan to continue to evaluate strategic opportunities as they arise  including acquisitions and other business combination transactions  strategic relationships  capital infusions and the purchase or sale of assets 
revenues 
we derive revenues from sales of our ics  cards  switch systems and accessories 
our sales have historically been made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term agreements 
to date  we have derived a substantial portion of our revenues from a relatively small number of customers 
sales to our top ten customers represented  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
sales to customers representing or more of revenues accounted for  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the loss of one or more of our principal customers or the reduction or deferral of purchases of our products by one of these customers could cause our revenues to decline materially if we are unable to increase our revenues from other customers 
our customers  including our most significant customers  are not obligated by long term contracts to purchase our products and may cancel orders with limited potential penalties 
the majority of our sales are on a purchase order basis 
if any of our large customers reduces or cancels its purchases from us for any reason  it could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
during q  oracle acquired approximately million shares of mellanox common stock 
sales to oracle during were million  and were conducted at arm length 
there were no other material transactions with oracle 
at december   accounts receivable from oracle totaled  cost of revenues and gross profit 
the cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of silicon wafers purchased from our foundry supplier  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  or tsmc  costs associated with the assembly  packaging and production testing of our products by advanced semiconductor engineering  or ase  outside processing costs associated with the manufacture of our host channel adapters  or hca cards  and switch systems by flextronics  and switch systems by comtel  royalties due to third parties  warranty costs  excess and obsolete inventory costs and costs of personnel associated with production management and quality assurance 
in addition  after we purchase wafers from our foundries  we also face yield risk related to manufacturing these wafers into semiconductor devices 
manufacturing yield is the percentage of acceptable product resulting from the manufacturing process  as identified when the product is tested as a finished ic 
if our manufacturing yields decrease  our cost per unit increases  which could have a significant adverse impact on our cost of revenues 
we do not have long term pricing agreements with tsmc and ase 
accordingly  our costs are subject to price fluctuations based on the overall cyclical demand for semiconductors 
we purchase our inventory pursuant to standard purchase orders 
we estimate that lead times for delivery of our finished semiconductors from our foundry supplier and assembly  packaging and production testing subcontractor are approximately three to four months  lead times for delivery from our hca card manufacturing subcontractor are approximately eight to ten weeks  and lead times for delivery from our switch systems manufacturing subcontractors are approximately twelve weeks 
we build inventory based on forecasts of customer orders rather than the actual orders themselves 
in addition  our customers are seeking opportunities to minimize their inventory on hand while demanding 
table of contents shorter lead times for orders placed 
as a result  we have increased our inventory levels over the past year to meet this demand 
we expect our cost of revenues to increase over time as a result of the expected increase in our sales volume 
we expect our cost of revenues as a percentage of sales to increase in the future as a result of a reduction in the average sale price of our products and a higher percentage of revenue deriving from sales of hca cards and switch systems  which generally yield lower gross margins 
this trend will depend on overall customer demand for our products  our product mix  competitive product offerings and related pricing and our ability to reduce manufacturing costs 
operational expenses research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  share based compensation and associated costs for employees engaged in research and development  costs associated with computer aided design software tools  depreciation expense and tape out costs 
tape out costs are expenses related to the manufacture of new products  including charges for mask sets  prototype wafers  mask set revisions and testing incurred before releasing new products 
we anticipate these expenses will increase in future periods based on an increase in personnel to support our product development activities and the introduction of new products 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses may fluctuate over the course of a year based on the timing of our product tape outs 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  share based compensation and associated costs for employees engaged in sales  marketing and customer support  commission payments to external  third party sales representatives  advertising  and charges for trade shows  promotions and travel 
we expect these expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods based on an increase in sales and marketing personnel  increased marketing activities and higher commission payments related to increased revenues 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  share based compensation and associated costs for employees engaged in finance  legal  human resources and administrative activities  and other professional services expenses for accounting and corporate legal fees 
we expect these expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods based on an increase in personnel to support our business activities 
taxes on income our operations in israel have been granted approved enterprise status by the investment center of the israeli ministry of industry  trade and labor  which makes us eligible for tax benefits under the israeli law for encouragement of capital investments  under the terms of the approved enterprise program  income that is attributable to our operations in yokneam  israel will be exempt from income tax for a period of ten years commencing when we first generate taxable income after setting off our losses from prior years 
income that is attributable to our operations in tel aviv  israel will be exempt from income tax for a period of two years commencing when we first generate taxable income and will be subject to a reduced income tax rate generally to  depending on the percentage of foreign investment in the company for the following five to eight years 
we expect the approved enterprise tax holiday associated with our yokneam and tel aviv operations to begin in the yokneam tax holiday is expected to expire in and the tel aviv tax holiday is expected to expire between and critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements 
table of contents requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  fair value of financial instruments  short term investments  inventory valuation  and impairment of long lived assets  warranty provision  share based compensation and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
therefore  we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates 
for further information on all of our significant accounting policies  please see note  the company and summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in part iv  item of this report 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sales of products when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
we use a binding purchase order or a signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
delivery occurs when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
our standard arrangement with our customers typically includes freight on board shipping point and no right of return and no customer acceptance provisions 
the customer obligation to pay and the payment terms are set at the time of delivery and are not dependent on the subsequent resale of the product 
we determine whether collectibility is probable on a customer by customer basis 
when assessing the probability of collection  we consider the number of years the customer has been in business and the history of our collections 
customers are subject to a credit review process that evaluates the customers financial positions and ultimately their ability to pay 
if it is determined at the outset of an arrangement that collection is not probable  no product is shipped and no revenue is recognized unless cash is received in advance 
a portion of our sales are made to distributors under agreements which contain a limited right to return unsold product and price protection provisions 
we recognize revenue from these distributors based on the sell through method using point of sale and inventory information provided by the distributor 
additionally  we maintain accruals and allowances for price protection and cooperative marketing programs 
we classify the costs of these programs based on the identifiable benefit received as either a reduction of revenue  a cost of sale or an operating expense 
we also maintain inventory  or hubbing  arrangements with certain customers 
pursuant to these arrangements we deliver products to a customer or a designated third party warehouse based upon the customer projected needs  but do not recognize product revenue unless and until the customer reports it has removed our product from the warehouse to be incorporated into its end products 
we recognize revenue from the sale of hardware products and software bundled with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware in accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance 
we recognize revenue in accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following types of sales transactions i standalone sales of software products  ii sales of software upgrades and iii sales of software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality of the hardware 
for multiple element arrangements that include a combination of hardware  software and services  such as post contract customer support  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate elements based on fair value 
effective october   we adopted authoritative guidance allowing the allocation of the arrangement consideration using our best estimate of selling price 
the change was made prospectively from the beginning of the fiscal year and did not have a material impact on 
table of contents our consolidated financial statements  including interim consolidated financial statements reported in the year of adoption 
if an arrangement includes undelivered elements that are not essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  we defer the fair value or best estimate selling price of the undelivered elements and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered elements 
if the undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  no revenue is recognized 
in the arrangements described above  we recognize revenue upon shipment of each element  hardware or software  assuming all other basic revenue recognition criteria are met  as both the hardware or software are considered delivered elements and the only undelivered element is post contract customer support 
the revenue from the post contract customer support is recognized ratably over the term of the related contract 
we account for multiple element arrangements that consist of software or software related products  including the sale of upgrades to previously sold software and post contract customer support  in accordance with industry specific accounting guidance for software and software related transactions 
for such transactions  revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element  and fair value is generally determined by vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in such multiple element arrangements  we defer revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed  or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
when the fair value of a delivered element has not been established  but fair value exists for the undelivered elements  we use the residual method to recognize revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue 
post contract support is recognized ratably over the term of the related contract 
costs incurred for shipping and handling expenses to customers are recorded as cost of revenues 
to the extent these amounts are billed to the customer in a sales transaction  we record the shipping and handling fees as revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based on an assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts 
if we determine that a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations  we provide a specific allowance for credit losses to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
probability of collection is assessed on a customer by customer basis and our historical experience with each customer 
customers are subject to an ongoing credit review process that evaluates the customers financial positions 
we review and update our estimates for allowance for doubtful accounts on a quarterly basis 
our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
our bad debt expense totaled approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
fair value of financial instruments our financial instruments consist of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  forward contracts  accounts receivable  accounts payable and other accrued liabilities 
we believe that the carrying amounts of the financial instruments approximate their respective fair values 
when there is no readily available market data  we may make fair value estimates  which may not necessarily represent the amounts that could be realized in a current or future sale of these assets 

table of contents short term investments we classify short term investment as available for sale securities 
we view our available for sale portfolio as available for use in current operations 
available for sale securities are recorded at fair value  and we record temporary unrealized holding gains and losses as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
we charge unrealized losses against net earnings when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary 
we review several factors to determine whether a loss is other than temporary 
these factors include but are not limited to the length of time a security is in an unrealized loss position  the extent to which fair value is less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
market is determined based on net realizable value 
cost is determined for raw materials on a first in  first out basis  for work in process based on actual costs and for finished goods based on standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
we reserve for excess and obsolete inventory based on forecasted demand generally over a six to twelve months period and market conditions 
inventory reserves are not reversed and permanently reduce the cost basis of the affected inventory until it is either sold or scrapped 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets  including equipment  furniture and fixtures and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted and without interest charges future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount 
we review for impairment charges on a regular basis 
investment in privately held companies as of december   we held a million investment in a privately held company 
we account for this investment under the cost method 
to determine if the investment is recoverable  we monitor the privately held company revenue and earnings trends relative to pre defined milestones and overall business prospects  the general market conditions in its industry and other factors related to its ability to remain in business  such as liquidity and receipt of additional funding 
during we maintained investments in two privately held companies and identified certain events and changes in circumstances indicating that the fair value of these investments had been negatively impacted 
we determined that we will not be able to recover our investments in full within the foreseeable future 
as a result  we recorded a million impairment loss on a write down of these investments to reduce their carrying value to an expected recoverable amount 
the impairment loss write down was included in other income  net on the consolidated statements of operations 
during the fourth quarter of  one of these investments was sold at a value that approximated its carrying cost at that time 
warranty provision we provide a limited warranty for periods of up to three years from the date of delivery against defects in materials and workmanship 
if a customer has a defective product  we will either repair the goods or provide replacement products at no charge 
we record estimated warranty expenses at the time we recognize the associated product revenues based on our historical rates of return and costs of 
table of contents repair over the preceding month period 
in addition  we recognize estimated warranty expenses for specific defects at the time those defects are identified 

table of contents share based compensation we have in effect share incentive plans under which incentive share options have been granted to employees and non qualified share options have been granted to employees and non employee members of the board of directors 
we also have an employee share purchase plan for all eligible employees 
in  we began granting restricted share units to employees and non employee members of the board of directors 
we account for share based compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of the share option awards as of the grant dates 
we estimate the fair value of share option awards using the black scholes option valuation model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions including the expected share price volatility  the calculation of expected term  and the fair value of the underlying ordinary share on the date of grant  among other inputs 
share compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over each optionee requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we base our estimate of expected volatility on a combination of our historical volatility and reported market value data for a group of publicly traded companies  which were selected from market indices that we believe would be indicators of our future share price volatility  after consideration of their size  stage of lifecycle  profitability  growth  risk and return on investment 
we calculate the expected term of our options using the simplified method as prescribed by the authoritative guidance 
the expected term for newly granted options is approximately years 
share based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and this estimate is revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from that estimated  adjustments may be required to share based compensation expense in future periods 
income taxes to prepare our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must also make judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax asset is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets which we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria 
our judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to changes in market conditions  changes in tax laws  tax planning strategies or other factors 
if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future  the valuation allowances we have established may be increased or decreased  resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense 
our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses  the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region  the availability of tax credits and carryforwards  and the effectiveness of its tax planning strategies 
we use a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with the guidance on judgments regarding the realizability of deferred taxes 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we consider 
table of contents many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
in connection with the commencement of the approved enterprise tax holiday in  all deferred tax assets associated with our yokneam and tel aviv operations were remeasured at a rate 
as a result  the company recognized million as tax expense during the fourth quarter of results of operations the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  total revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other income  net provision for taxes on income net income comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  revenues

year ended december  of revenues of revenues in thousands in thousands ics boards switch systems cables  accessories and other total revenue revenues 
revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of approximately 
the increase in revenues resulted primarily from increased sales across all of our product lines 
in particular  we experienced substantial increases in sales of integrated circuits and switch systems 
the revenues are not necessarily indicative of future results 

table of contents gross profit and margin 
gross profit was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of approximately 
as a percentage of revenues  gross margin decreased to in the year ended december  from approximately in the year ended december  the decrease in gross margins was primarily due to an increase in sales of our switch systems  boards and accessories for which we typically earn lower margins 
gross margin for is not necessarily indicative of future results 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of approximately 
the increase was primarily attributable to higher employee related expenses of approximately million due to additional headcount and merit increases  higher facility related expenses of approximately million related to additional office space in israel  higher share based compensation of approximately million associated with new share based awards  and an increase in outsourcing expenses of approximately million partially offset by a decrease in new product expenses of approximately million primarily due to tape out costs during we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to devote resources to develop new products  meet the changing requirements of our customers  expand into new markets and technologies and hire additional personnel 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of approximately 
the increase was primarily attributable to higher employee related expenses of approximately million associated with increased headcount and merit increases  an increase in share based compensation of approximately  due to new share based awards  an increase in sales and marketing activities of approximately  and an increase of approximately  in equipment related expenses primarily due to customer product evaluations partially offset by a decrease of approximately  in commission expenses due to changes in our external sales representative compensation plan 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of approximately 
the increase was primarily due to higher share based compensation expenses of approximately million due to new share based awards  an increase in employee related expenses of  due to additional headcount and merit increases and an increase in depreciation of approximately share based compensation expense 
the following table presents details of total share based compensation expense that is included in each functional line item in our consolidated statements of income year ended december  in thousands cost of goods sold research and development sales and marketing general and administrative 
table of contents the amount of unearned share based compensation currently estimated to be expensed from through related to unvested share based payment awards at december  is million 
of this amount  million  million  million and million are currently estimated to be recorded in   and  respectively 
the weighted average period over which the unearned share based compensation is expected to be recognized is approximately years 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested awards  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned share based compensation expense 
future share based compensation expense and unearned share based compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions 
other income  net 
other income  net consists of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  foreign currency exchange gains and losses and impairment of our investments in privately held companies 
other income or expense  net was an expense of  for the year ended december  compared to income of  for the year ended december  the decline was primarily attributable to an increase of  in foreign exchange losses  an increase of  in losses from investments in privately held companies and a decrease of  in interest income 
as of december   our investment portfolio included investments of million in a privately held company 
in the year ended december   we determined that the decline in our investments in the preferred stock of two of the privately held companies wasn t fully recoverable within the foreseeable future and recorded impairment charges of million  to reduce the carrying value of these investments 
during the fourth quarter  we sold our holdings in one of these privately held companies 
provision for taxes on income 
our tax expense was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the federal statutory rate was for and our effective tax rates were and for and  respectively 
the difference between our effective tax rate in and the federal statutory tax rate is primarily due to full utilization of deferred tax assets associated with carryforward losses and research and developments costs in israel before the approved enterprise tax holiday begins 
the difference between our effective tax rate in and the federal statutory tax rate is primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates than the federal statutory tax rate 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  revenues

year ended december  of revenues of revenues in thousands in thousands ics boards switch systems cables  accessories and other total revenue 
table of contents revenues 
revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of approximately 
this increase in revenues resulted from increased sales of boards  switch systems and cables and accessories  partially offset by a decrease in sales of ics 
gross profit and margin 
gross profit was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of 
as a percentage of revenues  gross margin decreased to in the year ended december  from approximately in the year ended december  the decrease in gross margins was primarily due to a decrease in ic sales for which we normally earn higher margins  and an increase in sales of our switch systems for which we typically earn lower margins 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of approximately 
the increase was primarily attributable to higher share based compensation of approximately million due to new option grants and a true up of estimated forfeitures for share based compensation expense calculation purposes  increased software related expenses of approximately  due to software licensing and maintenance  higher new product expenses of approximately  primarily due to non recurring engineering charges and increased outsourcing expenses of approximately  partially offset by lower salary related expenses of approximately  associated with temporary salary reductions 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of approximately

table of contents other income  net 
other income  net consists of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  foreign currency exchange gains and losses and impairment of our investments in privately held companies 
other income  net was  for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decline is primarily attributable to a decrease of million in interest income on investments in securities as a result of lower yields  foreign exchange losses of  compared to foreign exchange gains of  in the prior year and a reduction in other income of  as of december   our investment portfolio included investments of million in privately held companies 
in the years ended december  and  we determined that the decline in our investment in the preferred stock of one of the privately held companies was other than temporary and recorded impairment charges of million and million  respectively  to reduce the carrying value of this investment 
the additional impairment charge in is a result of the continued deterioration in one of the privately held company financial results and prospective business outlook 
provision for taxes on income 
our tax expense was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the higher tax expense was primarily due to increased taxes related to the utilization of deferred tax assets associated with carry forward losses and research and development costs in israel 
our effective tax rate the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december  the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the fact that in we recorded a benefit from the recognition of additional deferred tax assets associated with net operating losses expected to be utilized in israel before the approved enterprise tax holiday begins 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations through a combination of sales of equity securities and cash generated by operations 
as of december   our principal source of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and short term investments of approximately million 
on february  we completed the acquisition of voltaire 
the total cash purchase price was million  or million net of cash held by voltaire 
as a result  after the acquisition we had approximately million in cash and investments 
we believe this level of cash and investments is sufficient to fund our operations over the next months taking into account expected increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures to support our infrastructure and growth 
operating activities net cash generated by our operating activities amounted to approximately million in the year ended december  net cash generated by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income of approximately million adjusted for non cash items including million for share based compensation  approximately million for deferred taxes and approximately million for depreciation and amortization 
furthermore  net cash generated by operating activities increased due to an increase of approximately million in accrued liabilities  a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of approximately million and a decrease in accounts receivable of million  partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in accounts payable and an increase in inventory of approximately million due to higher safety stock levels

contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years in thousands commitments under capital lease non cancelable operating lease commitments service commitments purchase commitments total as of december   we had no contractual obligations expected to have an effect on our liquidity and cash flow in periods beyond five years 
for purposes of this table  purchase and service obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within relatively short time horizons 
in addition  we have purchase orders that represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements 
the contractual obligation table excludes our unrecognized tax benefit liabilities because we cannot make a reliable estimate of the timing of cash payments 
as of december   our unrecognized tax benefits totaled approximately million  which would reduce our income tax expense and effective tax rate  if recognized 
acquisition of voltaire on november   we entered into a merger agreement with voltaire according to which each issued and outstanding ordinary share of voltaire will be deemed to have been transferred to us in exchange for the right to receive in cash  without interest 
in addition  each outstanding option and restricted stock unit of voltaire shall be assumed by us and converted into an option or restricted stock unit using certain conversion ratio 
on february   all conditions stipulated in the merger agreement had been met and the acquisition was completed 
on the closing date we paid to voltaire shareholders approximately million in cash and assumed all of voltaire outstanding options held by employees  which were converted into equity awards to acquire an aggregate of  ordinary shares of the company 
we will record the purchase of voltaire using the business combination method of accounting and will recognize the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values as of the date of the acquisition 
the results of voltaire operations will be included in our consolidated results of operations beginning with the date of the acquisition 
the company is currently evaluating the fair 
table of contents values of the consideration transferred  assets acquired and liabilities assumed and will commence its purchase price allocation in the first quarter of fiscal year recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued updated guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures  which requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers 
in addition  in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs  or level  a reporting entity should disclose separately information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements that is  on a gross basis rather than one net number 
the updated guidance also requires that an entity should provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities and disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and non recurring fair value measurements for level and level fair value measurements 
the updated guidance is effective for interim or annual financial reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward activity in level fair value measurements  which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect adoption of the updated guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
impact of currency exchange rates exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our most significant foreign currency exposure is the new israeli shekel  or nis 
we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
in fiscal year  we used foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of operating expenses denominated in nis 
our derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in assets or liabilities with final gains or losses recorded in other income  net or as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into operating expenses in the same period in which the hedged operating expenses are recognized 
see note  derivatives and hedging activities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in part iv  item of this report 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate fluctuation risk we do not have any long term borrowings 
our investments consist of cash and cash equivalents  short term deposits  money market funds and interest bearing investments in us government debt securities with an average maturity of less than one year 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
the company  by policy  limits the amount of its credit exposure through diversification and restricting its investments to highly rated securities 
individual securities are limited to comprising no more than of the portfolio value at the time of purchase  except us treasury or agency securities 
highly rated securities are defined as having a minimum moody or standard poor rating of a or a  respectively 
the company has not experienced any significant losses on its cash equivalents or short term investments 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
our investments are exposed to market risk due to a fluctuation in interest rates  which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments 
due to the short term nature of our 
table of contents investment portfolio  we do not believe an immediate change in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio  and therefore we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected to any degree by a sudden change in market interest rates 
foreign currency exchange risk we derive all of our revenues in us dollars 
the us dollar is our functional and reporting currency in all of our foreign locations 
however  a significant portion of our headcount related expenses  consisting principally of salaries and related personnel expenses  are denominated in new israeli shekels  or nis 
this foreign currency exposure gives rise to market risk associated with exchange rate movements of the us dollar against the nis 
furthermore  we anticipate that a material portion of our expenses will continue to be denominated in nis 
to the extent the us dollar weakens against the nis  we will experience a negative impact on our profit margins 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  we have established a balance sheet and anticipated transaction risk management program 
currency forward contracts and natural hedges are generally utilized in this hedging program 
we do not enter into forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
our hedging program reduces  but does not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements see part ii  item a  risk factors 
if we were to experience a change in currency exchange rates  the impact on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  after taking into account hedges and offsetting positions  would result in a loss before taxes of approximately  at december  there would also be an impact on future operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
at december   approximately million of our monthly operating expenses were denominated in nis 
as of december   we had forward contracts in place that hedged future operating expenses of approximately million nis  or approximately million based upon the exchange rate as of december  the forward contracts cover future nis denominated operating expenses expected to occur over the next twelve months 
our derivatives expose us to credit risk to the extent that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement 
we seek to mitigate such risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions and by spreading the risk across a number of major financial institutions 
however  under current market conditions  failure of one or more of these financial institutions is possible and could result in incurred losses 
inflation related risk we believe that the rate of inflation in israel has not had a material impact on our business to date 
our cost in israel in us dollar terms will increase if inflation in israel exceeds the devaluation of the nis against the us dollar or if the timing of such devaluation lags behind inflation in israel
