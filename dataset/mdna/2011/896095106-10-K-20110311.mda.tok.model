the company believes the use of these non generally accepted accounting principles non gaap measures provides additional clarity in assessing its results 
on may   the office of the comptroller of the currency closed granite community bank granite  granite bay  california and appointed the fdic as receiver 
that same date  the bank assumed the banking operations of granite from the fdic under a whole bank purchase and assumption agreement with loss sharing 
under the terms of the loss sharing agreement  the fdic will cover a substantial portion of any future losses on loans  related unfunded loan commitments  other real estate owned oreo foreclosed assets and accrued interest on loans for up to days 
the fdic will absorb of losses and share in of loss recoveries on the covered assets acquired from granite 
the loss sharing arrangements for non single family residential and single family residential loans are in effect for years and years  respectively  and the loss recovery provisions are in effect for years and years  respectively  from the acquisition date 
with this agreement  the bank added one traditional bank branch in each of granite bay and auburn  california 
this acquisition is consistent with the bank s community banking expansion strategy and provides further opportunity to fill in the bank s market presence in the greater sacramento  california market 
the company refers to loans and foreclosed assets that are covered by loss share agreements as covered loans and covered foreclosed assets  respectively 
in addition  the company refers to loans purchased or obtained in a business combination as purchased credit impaired pci loans  or purchased non credit impaired pnci loans 
the company refers to loans that it originates as originated loans 
as of december   the company has no loans that it classifies as pnci loans 
geographical descriptions for the purpose of describing the geographical location of the company s loans  the company has defined northern california as that area of california north of  and including  stockton  central california as that area of the state south of stockton  to and including  bakersfield  and southern california as that area of the state south of bakersfield

following is a summary of the company s net interest income for the periods indicated dollars in thousands year ended december  components of net interest income interest income interest expense fte adjustment net interest income fte net interest margin fte net interest income fte for the year ended december  was  a decrease of  or compared to the year ended december  this decrease in net interest income was attributable to a change in the mix of interest earning assets  with average loan balances decreasing and other categories of lower yielding assets increasing 
the decrease in average loan balances was due to decreased loan demand and unfavorable credit risks associated with loans in the economic environment that persisted throughout while the company was able to continue to lower interest bearing liability rates  and thus interest expense  sufficiently to overcome the decrease in interest income due to decreases in the average yield on interest earning assets during  it was not sufficient to overcome the decrease in average loan balances during the yield and volume rate tables shown below are useful in illustrating and quantifying the developments that affected net interest income during and net interest income fte for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or compared to the year ended december  during  the company was able to decrease rates paid on deposits and other sources of funds  and at the same time significantly grow deposit balances 
on the other hand  during  it was difficult for the company to deploy these increased low cost deposit balances into relatively high yielding loans and securities 
the difficulty in deploying these increased funding sources was primarily due to decreased loan demand and unfavorable credit  liquidity  and interest rate risks associated with loans and securities in the economic environment that persisted throughout as such  much of the increase in deposit balances during was deployed into lower yielding short term interest earning balances at the federal reserve bank 
in the final analysis  the company was able to lower interest bearing liability rates  and thus interest expense  sufficiently to overcome the decrease in interest income that was due primarily to a decrease in the average yield on loans during

table of contents provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses was  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increases in the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily the result of changes in the make up of the originated loan portfolio and the bank s loss factors related to the originated loan portfolio in reaction to increased losses in the construction  commercial real estate  commercial industrial c i  home equity and auto indirect loan portfolios  and decreases in expected cash flows of certain pci loan pools

table of contents commissions on sale of nondeposit investment products decreased  in due to lower demand for investment products 
the change in indemnification asset of  recorded in is primarily due to an increase in estimated loan losses from the loan portfolio and foreclosed assets acquired in the granite acquisition on may   and the fact that such losses are generally covered at the rate of by the fdic 
the actual increase in estimated losses is reflected in decreased interest income  increased provision for loan losses and or increased provision for foreclosed asset losses 
the may  acquisition of granite added noninterest income totaling  through december  including change in indemnification asset of  noninterest income increased  to  in service charges on deposit accounts were up  due primarily to increases in per item overdraft fees implemented during atm fees and interchange  and other service fees were up  due to expansion of the company s atm network and customer base

increase in cash value of life insurance increased  due to essentially unchanged earning rates on the related life insurance policies 
other noninterest income decreased  due primarily to decreases in deposit sweep income  official check float commission rebate  and lease brokerage income  and increased loss of disposal of fixed assets

the changes are indicative of the economic environment which has lead to increases in professional loan collection expenses  provision for foreclosed asset losses  and foreclosed asset expenses 
occupancy and equipment expenses increased primarily due to four new branch openings  one each in the third and fourth quarters of and one each in the first and second quarters of  and three branches and one admin facility acquired in the granite acquisition on may  the may  acquisition of granite added noninterest expenses totaling  through december  including salaries and benefits expense of  and provision for foreclosed asset losses of  partially offsetting these increases was a  decrease in change in reserve for unfunded commitments due to a reduction in estimated usage of such commitments 
other noninterest expenses increased  to  in changes in the various categories of other noninterest expense are reflected in the table above 
the changes are indicative of the company s efforts to use technology to become more efficient  the economic environment and increased regulatory assessments during income taxes the effective tax rate on income was   and in   and  respectively

table of contents restricted equity securities restricted equity securities were  at december  and  at december  the entire balance of restricted equity securities at december  and december  represent the bank s investment in the federal home loan bank of san francisco fhlb 
the decrease of  is attributable to the redemption of  and  of fhlb and federal reserve bank stock  respectively  offset in part by the purchase of  and  of fhlb stock and federal reserve bank stock  respectively  via the fdic assisted acquisition of granite 
fhlb stock is carried at par and does not have a readily determinable fair value 
while technically these are considered equity securities  there is no market for the fhlb stock 
therefore  the shares are considered as restricted investment securities 
management periodically evaluates fhlb stock for other than temporary impairment 
management s determination of whether these investments are impaired is based on its assessment of the ultimate recoverability of cost rather than by recognizing temporary declines in value 
the determination of whether a decline affects the ultimate recoverability of cost is influenced by criteria such as the significance of any decline in net assets of the fhlb as compared to the capital stock amount for the fhlb and the length of time this situation has persisted  commitments by the fhlb to make payments required by law or regulation and the level of such payments in relation to the operating performance of the fhlb  the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on institutions and  accordingly  the customer base of the fhlb  and the liquidity position of the fhlb 
as a member of the fhlb system  the company is required to maintain a minimum level of investment in fhlb stock based on specific percentages of its outstanding mortgages  total assets  or fhlb advances 
the company may request redemption at par value of any stock in excess of the minimum required investment 
stock redemptions are at the discretion of the fhlb 
loans the bank concentrates its lending activities in four principal areas real estate mortgage loans residential and commercial loans  consumer loans  commercial loans including agricultural loans  and real estate construction loans 
at december   these four categories accounted for approximately    and of the bank s loan portfolio  respectively  as compared to    and  at december  the interest rates charged for the loans made by the bank vary with the degree of risk  the size and maturity of the loans  the borrower s relationship with the bank and prevailing money market rates indicative of the bank s cost of funds 
the majority of the bank s loans are direct loans made to individuals  farmers and local businesses 
the bank relies substantially on local promotional activity and personal contacts by bank officers  directors and employees to compete with other financial institutions 
the bank makes loans to borrowers whose applications include a sound purpose  a viable repayment source and a plan of repayment established at inception and generally backed by a secondary source of repayment 
in connection with the fdic assisted acquisition of certain of the assets and liability of granite  the bank entered into a loss sharing agreement with the fdic that covered approximately million of granite s assets 
the bank shares in the losses on the asset pools loans  and foreclosed loan collateral covered under the loss sharing agreement 
pursuant to the terms of the loss sharing agreement  the fdic is obligated to reimburse the bank for of losses with respect to covered assets 
the bank will reimburse the fdic for of recoveries with respect to losses for which the fdic paid the bank under the loss sharing agreement 
we refer to the loans covered by the loss sharing agreement as covered loans 
we referred to our loans that are not covered by the loss sharing agreement as noncovered loans 
in addition  we refer to loans purchased or obtained in a business combination as purchased credit impaired pci loans  or purchased non credit impaired pnci loans 
the company refers to loans that it originates as originated loans 
as of december   the company has no loans that it classifies as pnci loans 
at december  loans  including net deferred loan costs  totaled  which was a  decrease over the balances at the end of demand for commercial real estate real estate mortgage loans was weak during demand for home equity loans and lines of credit was weak to modest during real estate construction loans declined during as did auto dealer loans 

table of contents at december  loans  including net deferred loan costs  totaled  which was a  decrease over the balances at the end of demand for commercial real estate real estate mortgage loans was relatively strong during demand for home equity loans and lines of credit was modest during real estate construction loans declined during as did auto dealer loans 
the average loan to deposit ratio in was compared to in loan portfolio composite the following table shows the company s loan balances  including net deferred loan costs  for the periods indicated year ended december  dollars in thousands real estate mortgage consumer commercial real estate construction total loans the following table shows the company s loan balances  including net deferred loan costs  as a percentage of total loans for the periods indicated year ended december  dollars in thousands real estate mortgage consumer commercial real estate construction total loans asset quality and nonperforming assets nonperforming assets loans originated by the company  ie  not purchased or acquired in a business combination  are reported at the principal amount outstanding  net of deferred loan fees and costs 
loan origination and commitment fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred  and the net amount is amortized as an adjustment of the related loan s yield over the actual life of the loan 
originated loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are designated as nonaccrual loans 
originated loans are placed in nonaccrual status when reasonable doubt exists as to the full  timely collection of interest or principal  or a loan becomes contractually past due by days or more with respect to interest or principal and is not well secured and in the process of collection 
when an originated loan is placed on nonaccrual status  all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed 
income on such loans is then recognized only to the extent that cash is received and where the future collection of principal is probable 
interest accruals are resumed on such loans only when they are brought fully current with respect to interest and principal and when  in the judgment of management  the loan is estimated to be fully collectible as to both principal and interest 
an allowance for loan losses for originated loans is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense 
originated loans and deposit related overdrafts are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely or  with respect to consumer installment loans  according to an established delinquency schedule 
the allowance is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in existing loans and leases  based on evaluations of the collectability  impairment and prior loss experience of loans and leases 
the evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and size of the portfolio  overall portfolio quality  loan concentrations  specific problem loans  and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to pay 
the company defines an originated loan as impaired when it is probable the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impaired originated loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate 
as a practical expedient  impairment may be measured based on the loan s observable market price or the fair 
table of contents value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
when the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  the impairment is recorded through a valuation allowance 
in situations related to originated loans where  for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower s financial difficulties  the company grants a concession for other than an insignificant period of time to the borrower that the company would not otherwise consider  the related loan is classified as a troubled debt restructuring tdr 
the company strives to identify borrowers in financial difficulty early and work with them to modify to more affordable terms before their loan reaches nonaccrual status 
these modified terms may include rate reductions  principal forgiveness  payment forbearance and other actions intended to minimize the economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral 
in cases where the company grants the borrower new terms that provide for a reduction of either interest or principal  the company measures any impairment on the restructuring as noted above for impaired loans 
tdr loans are classified as impaired until they are fully paid off or charged off 
loans that are in nonaccrual status at the time they become tdr loans  remain in nonaccrual status until the borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance which the company generally believes to be six consecutive months of payments  or equivalent 
otherwise  tdr loans are subject to the same nonaccrual and charge off policies as noted above with respect to their restructured principal balance 
credit risk is inherent in the business of lending 
as a result  the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb losses inherent in the company s originated loan portfolio 
this is maintained through periodic charges to earnings 
these charges are included in the consolidated income statements as provision for loan losses 
all specifically identifiable and quantifiable losses are immediately charged off against the allowance 
however  for a variety of reasons  not all losses are immediately known to the company and  of those that are known  the full extent of the loss may not be quantifiable at that point in time 
the balance of the company s allowance for originated loan losses is meant to be an estimate of these unknown but probable losses inherent in the portfolio 
the company formally assesses the adequacy of the allowance for originated loan losses on a quarterly basis 
determination of the adequacy is based on ongoing assessments of the probable risk in the outstanding originated loan portfolio  and to a lesser extent the company s originated loan commitments 
these assessments include the periodic re grading of credits based on changes in their individual credit characteristics including delinquency  seasoning  recent financial performance of the borrower  economic factors  changes in the interest rate environment  growth of the portfolio as a whole or by segment  and other factors as warranted 
loans are initially graded when originated 
they are re graded as they are renewed  when there is a new loan to the same borrower  when identified facts demonstrate heightened risk of nonpayment  or if they become delinquent 
re grading of larger problem loans occurs at least quarterly 
confirmation of the quality of the grading process is obtained by independent credit reviews conducted by consultants specifically hired for this purpose and by various bank regulatory agencies 
the company s method for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for originated loan losses includes specific allowances for impaired originated loans and leases  formula allowance factors for pools of credits  and allowances for changing environmental factors eg  interest rates  growth  economic conditions  etc allowance factors for loan pools are based on historical loss experience by product type 
allowances for impaired loans are based on analysis of individual credits 
allowances for changing environmental factors are management s best estimate of the probable impact these changes have had on the originated loan portfolio as a whole 
the allowance for originated loans is included in the allowance for loan losses 
acquired loans are valued as of acquisition date in accordance with financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc topic  business combinations 
loans purchased with evidence of credit deterioration since origination for which it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected are referred to as purchased credit impaired pci loans 
pci loans are accounted for under fasb asc topic  loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality 
in addition  because of the significant credit discounts associated with the loans acquired in the granite acquisition  the company elected to account for all loans acquired in the granite acquisition under fasb asc topic  and classify them all as pci loans 
under fasb asc topic and fasb asc topic  pci loans are recorded at fair value at acquisition date  factoring in credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loan 
accordingly  an allowance for loan losses is not carried over or recorded as of the acquisition date 
fair value is defined as the present value of the future estimated principal and interest payments of the loan  with the discount rate used in the present value calculation representing the estimated effective yield of the loan 
the difference 
table of contents between contractual future payments and estimated future payments is referred to as the nonaccretable difference 
the difference between estimated future payments and the present value of the estimated future payments is referred to as the accretable yield 
the accretable yield represents the amount that is expected to be recorded as interest income over the remaining life of the loan 
if after acquisition  the company determines that the future cash flows of a pci loan are expected to be more than the originally estimated  an increase in the discount rate effective yield would be made such that the newly increased accretable yield would be recognized  on a level yield basis  over the remaining estimated life of the loan 
if after acquisition  the company determines that the future cash flows of a pci loan are expected to be less than the previously estimated  the discount rate would first be reduced until the present value of the reduced cash flow estimate equals the previous present value however  the discount rate may not be lowered below its original level 
if the discount rate has been lowered to its original level and the present value has not been sufficiently lowered  an allowance for loan loss would be established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense to decrease the present value to the required level 
if the estimated cash flows improve after an allowance has been established for a loan  the allowance may be partially or fully reversed depending on the improvement in the estimated cash flows 
only after the allowance has been fully reversed may the discount rate be increased 
pci loans are put on nonaccrual status when cash flows cannot be reasonably estimated 
pci loans are charged off when evidence suggests cash flows are not recoverable 
foreclosed assets from pci loans are recorded in foreclosed assets at fair value with the fair value at time of foreclosure representing cash flow from the loan 
asc allows pci loans with similar risk characteristics and acquisition time frame to be pooled and have their cash flows aggregated as if they were one loan 
loans are also categorized as covered or noncovered 
covered loans refer to loans covered by a federal deposit insurance corporation fdic loss sharing agreement 
noncovered loans refer to loans not covered by a federal deposit insurance corporation fdic loss sharing agreement 
originated loans are reviewed on an individual basis for reclassification to nonaccrual status when any one of the following occurs the loan becomes days past due as to interest or principal  the full and timely collection of additional interest or principal becomes uncertain  the loan is classified as doubtful by internal credit review or bank regulatory agencies  a portion of the principal balance has been charged off  or the company takes possession of the collateral 
loans that are placed on nonaccrual even though the borrowers continue to repay the loans as scheduled are classified as performing nonaccrual and are included in total nonperforming loans 
the reclassification of loans as nonaccrual does not necessarily reflect management s judgment as to whether they are collectible 
interest income on originated nonaccrual loans that would have been recognized during the years ended december  and  if all such loans had been current in accordance with their original terms  totaled  and  respectively 
interest income actually recognized on these originated loans during the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
the company s policy is to place originated loans days or more past due on nonaccrual status 
in some instances when an originated loan is days past due management does not place it on nonaccrual status because the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
a loan is considered to be in the process of collection if  based on a probable specific event  it is expected that the loan will be repaid or brought current 
generally  this collection period would not exceed days 
loans where the collateral has been repossessed are classified as foreclosed assets 
management considers both the adequacy of the collateral and the other resources of the borrower in determining the steps to be taken to collect nonaccrual loans 
alternatives that are considered are foreclosure  collecting on guarantees  restructuring the loan or collection lawsuits

allowance for loan losses the company s allowance for loan losses is comprised of an allowance for originated loan losses and an allowance for pci loan losses 
both the allowance for originated loan losses and the allowance for pci loan losses are established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense 
originated loans and deposit related overdrafts are charged against the allowance for originated loan losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely or  with respect to consumer installment loans  according to an established delinquency schedule 
the allowance for originated loan losses is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in existing originated loans and leases  based on evaluations of the collectability  impairment and prior loss experience of those loans and leases 
the evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and size of the portfolio  overall portfolio quality  loan concentrations  specific problem loans  and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to pay 
the company defines an originated loan as impaired when it is probable the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impaired originated loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate 
as a practical expedient  impairment may be measured based on the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
when the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  the impairment is recorded through a valuation allowance 
in situations related to originated loans where  for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower s financial difficulties  the company grants a concession for other than an insignificant period of time to the borrower that the company would not otherwise consider  the related loan is classified as a troubled debt restructuring tdr 
the company strives to identify borrowers in financial difficulty early and work with them to modify to more affordable terms before their loan reaches nonaccrual status 
these modified terms may include rate reductions  principal forgiveness  payment forbearance and other actions intended to minimize the economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral 
in cases where the company grants the borrower new terms that provide for a reduction of either interest or principal  the company measures any impairment on the restructuring as noted above for impaired loans 
tdr loans are classified as impaired until they are fully paid off or charged off 
loans that are in nonaccrual status at the time they become tdr loans  remain in nonaccrual status until the borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance which the company generally believes to be six consecutive months of payments  or equivalent 
otherwise  tdr loans are subject to the same nonaccrual and charge off policies as noted above with respect to their restructured principal balance 
credit risk is inherent in the business of lending 
as a result  the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb losses inherent in the company s originated loan portfolio 
this is maintained through periodic charges to earnings 
these charges are included in the consolidated income statements as provision for loan losses 
all specifically identifiable and quantifiable losses are immediately charged off against the allowance 
however  for a variety of reasons  not all losses are immediately known to the company and  of those that are known  the full extent of the loss may not be quantifiable at that point in time 
the balance of the company s allowance for originated loan losses is meant to be an estimate of these unknown but probable losses inherent in the portfolio 
the company formally assesses the adequacy of the allowance for originated loan losses on a quarterly basis 
determination of the adequacy is based on ongoing assessments of the probable risk in the outstanding originated loan portfolio  and to a lesser extent the company s originated loan commitments 
these assessments include the periodic re grading of credits based on changes in their individual credit characteristics including delinquency  seasoning  recent financial performance of the borrower  economic factors  changes in the interest rate environment  growth of the portfolio as a whole or by segment  and other factors as warranted 
loans are initially graded when originated 
they are re graded as they are renewed  when there is a new loan to the same borrower  
table of contents when identified facts demonstrate heightened risk of nonpayment  or if they become delinquent 
re grading of larger problem loans occurs at least quarterly 
confirmation of the quality of the grading process is obtained by independent credit reviews conducted by consultants specifically hired for this purpose and by various bank regulatory agencies 
the company s method for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for originated loan losses includes specific allowances for impaired originated loans and leases  formula allowance factors for pools of credits  and allowances for changing environmental factors eg  interest rates  growth  economic conditions  etc allowance factors for loan pools are based on historical loss experience by product type 
allowances for impaired loans are based on analysis of individual credits 
allowances for changing environmental factors are management s best estimate of the probable impact these changes have had on the originated loan portfolio as a whole 
the allowance for originated loans is included in the allowance for loan losses 
as noted above  the allowance for originated loan losses consists of a specific allowance  a formula allowance  and an allowance for environmental factors 
the first component  the specific allowance  results from the analysis of identified credits that meet management s criteria for specific evaluation 
these loans are reviewed individually to determine if such loans are considered impaired 
impaired loans are those where management has concluded that it is probable that the borrower will be unable to pay all amounts due under the contractual terms 
loans specifically reviewed  including those considered impaired  are evaluated individually by management for loss potential by evaluating sources of repayment  including collateral as applicable  and a specified allowance for loan losses is established where necessary 
the second component of the allowance for originated loan losses  the formula allowance  is an estimate of the probable losses that have occurred across the major loan categories in the company s originated loan portfolio 
this analysis is based on loan grades by pool and the loss history of these pools 
this analysis covers the company s entire originated loan portfolio including unused commitments but excludes any loans  that were analyzed individually and assigned a specific allowance as discussed above 
the total amount allocated for this component is determined by applying loss estimation factors to outstanding loans and loan commitments 
the loss factors are based primarily on the company s historical loss experience tracked over a five year period and adjusted as appropriate for the input of current trends and events 
because historical loss experience varies for the different categories of originated loans  the loss factors applied to each category also differ 
in addition  there is a greater chance that the company has suffered a loss from a loan that was graded less than satisfactory than if the loan was last graded satisfactory 
therefore  for any given category  a larger loss estimation factor is applied to less than satisfactory loans than to those that the company last graded as satisfactory 
the resulting formula allowance is the sum of the allocations determined in this manner 
the third component of the allowance for originated loan losses  the environmental factor allowance  is a component that is not allocated to specific loans or groups of loans  but rather is intended to absorb losses that may not be provided for by the other components 
there are several primary reasons that the other components discussed above might not be sufficient to absorb the losses present in the originated loan portfolio  and the environmental factor allowance is used to provide for the losses that have occurred because of them 
the first reason is that there are limitations to any credit risk grading process 
the volume of originated loans makes it impractical to re grade every loan every quarter 
therefore  it is possible that some currently performing originated loans not recently graded will not be as strong as their last grading and an insufficient portion of the allowance will have been allocated to them 
grading and loan review often must be done without knowing whether all relevant facts are at hand 
troubled borrowers may deliberately or inadvertently omit important information from reports or conversations with lending officers regarding their financial condition and the diminished strength of repayment sources 
the second reason is that the loss estimation factors are based primarily on historical loss totals 
as such  the factors may not give sufficient weight to such considerations as the current general economic and business conditions that affect the company s borrowers and specific industry conditions that affect borrowers in that industry 
the factors might also not give sufficient weight to other environmental factors such as changing 
table of contents economic conditions and interest rates  portfolio growth  entrance into new markets or products  and other characteristics as may be determined by management 
specifically  in assessing how much environmental factor allowance needed to be provided at december   management considered the following with respect to the economy  management considered the effects of changes in gdp  unemployment  cpi  debt statistics  housing starts  housing sales  auto sales  agricultural prices  and other economic factors which serve as indicators of economic health and trends and which may have an impact on the performance of our borrowers  and with respect to changes in the interest rate environment  management considered the recent changes in interest rates and the resultant economic impact it may have had on borrowers with high leverage and or low profitability  and with respect to changes in energy prices  management considered the effect that increases  decreases or volatility may have on the performance of our borrowers  and with respect to loans to borrowers in new markets and growth in general  management considered the relatively short seasoning of such loans and the lack of experience with such borrowers 
each of these considerations was assigned a factor and applied to a portion or the entire originated loan portfolio 
since these factors are not derived from experience and are applied to large non homogeneous groups of loans  they are available for use across the portfolio as a whole 
although the weakening economy and resultant recession called for an increase in the factor related to economic conditions  the reductions in interest rates and energy prices coupled with very little loan growth resulted in a decrease in these factors causing the overall environmental factors allowance to decrease 
also  in prior years  the bank maintained a separate factor for real estate risk due to the fact that the bank had little or no losses in this loan category but anticipated that such losses would be experienced at some time 
during the course of the bank eliminated this environmental factor and instead provided for this risk in the formula allowance based on actual and expected loss ratios 
this not only resulted in a reduction of the environmental factors allowance but also resulted in an increase in the formula allowance 
the formula allowance was further increased due to increases in losses over the course of which in turn resulted in increases in the reserve factors for certain loan types accordingly 
these increased factors primarily affected construction loans  helocs  and indirect auto loans 
acquired loans are valued as of acquisition date in accordance with financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc topic  business combinations 
loans purchased with evidence of credit deterioration since origination for which it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected are referred to as purchased credit impaired pci loans 
pci loans are accounted for under fasb asc topic  loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality 
in addition  because of the significant credit discounts associated with the loans acquired in the granite acquisition  the company elected to account for all loans acquired in the granite acquisition under fasb asc topic  and classify them all as pci loans 
under fasb asc topic and fasb asc topic  pci loans are recorded at fair value at acquisition date  factoring in credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loan 
accordingly  an allowance for loan losses is not carried over or recorded as of the acquisition date 
fair value is defined as the present value of the future estimated principal and interest payments of the loan  with the discount rate used in the present value calculation representing the estimated effective yield of the loan 
the difference between contractual future payments and estimated future payments is referred to as the nonaccretable difference 
the difference between estimated future payments and the present value of the estimated future payments is referred to as the accretable yield 
the accretable yield represents the amount that is expected to be recorded as interest income over the remaining life of the loan 
if after acquisition  the company determines that the future cash flows of a pci loan are expected to be more than the originally estimated  an increase in the discount rate effective yield would be made such that the newly increased accretable yield would be recognized  on a level yield basis  over the remaining estimated life of the loan 
if after acquisition  the company determines that the future cash flows of a pci loan are expected to be less than the previously estimated  the discount rate would first be reduced until the present value of the reduced cash flow estimate equals the previous present value however  the discount rate may not be lowered below its original level 
if the discount rate has been lowered to its original level and the present value has not been sufficiently lowered  an allowance for loan loss would be established 
table of contents through a provision for loan losses charged to expense to decrease the present value to the required level 
if the estimated cash flows improve after an allowance has been established for a loan  the allowance may be partially or fully reversed depending on the improvement in the estimated cash flows 
only after the allowance has been fully reversed may the discount rate be increased 
pci loans are put on nonaccrual status when cash flows cannot be reasonably estimated 
pci loans are charged off when evidence suggests cash flows are not recoverable 
foreclosed assets from pci loans are recorded in foreclosed assets at fair value with the fair value at time of foreclosure representing cash flow from the loan 
asc allows pci loans with similar risk characteristics and acquisition time frame to be pooled and have their cash flows aggregated as if they were one loan

market risk management overview 
the goal for managing the assets and liabilities of the bank is to maximize shareholder value and earnings while maintaining a high quality balance sheet without exposing the bank to undue interest rate risk 
the board of directors has overall responsibility for the company s interest rate risk management policies 
the bank has an asset and liability management committee alco which establishes and monitors guidelines to control the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates 
asset liability management 
activities involved in asset liability management include but are not limited to lending  accepting and placing deposits  investing in securities and issuing debt 
interest rate risk is the primary market risk associated with asset liability management 
sensitivity of earnings to interest rate changes arises when yields on assets change in a different time period or in a different amount from that of interest costs on liabilities 
to mitigate interest rate risk  the structure of the balance sheet is managed with the goal that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities are correlated and contribute to earnings even in periods of volatile interest rates 
the asset liability management policy sets limits on the acceptable amount of variance in net interest margin and market value of equity under changing interest environments 
market value of equity is the net present value of estimated cash flows from the bank s assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items 
the bank uses simulation models to forecast net interest margin and market value of equity 
simulation of net interest margin and market value of equity under various interest rate scenarios is the primary tool used to measure interest rate risk 
using computer modeling techniques  the bank is able to estimate the potential impact of changing interest rates on net interest margin and market value of equity 
a balance sheet forecast is prepared using inputs of actual loan  securities and interest bearing liability ie deposits borrowings positions as the beginning base 
in the simulation of net interest income  the forecast balance sheet is processed against various interest rate scenarios 
these various interest rate scenarios include a flat rate scenario  which assumes interest rates are unchanged in the future  and rate ramp scenarios including   and basis points around the flat scenario 
these ramp scenarios assume that interest rates increase or decrease evenly in a ramp fashion over a twelve month period and remain at the new levels beyond twelve months 

table of contents the following table summarizes the projected effect on net interest income and net income due to changing interest rates as measured against a flat rate no interest rate change scenario over the succeeding twelve month period 
the simulation results shown below assume no changes in the structure of the company s balance sheet over the twelve months being measured a flat balance sheet scenario  and that deposit rates will track general interest rate changes by approximately interest rate risk simulation of net interest income and net income as of december  estimated change in change in interest net interest income nii rates basis points as of flat nii ramp ramp flat ramp in the simulation of market value of equity  the forecast balance sheet is processed against various interest rate scenarios 
these various interest rate scenarios include a flat rate scenario  which assumes interest rates are unchanged in the future  and rate shock scenarios including   and basis points around the flat scenario 
these rate shock scenarios assume that interest rates increase or decrease immediately in a shock fashion and remain at the new level in the future 
the following table summarizes the effect on market value of equity due to changing interest rates as measured against a flat rate no change scenario interest rate risk simulation of market value of equity as of december  estimated change in change in interest market value of equity mve rates basis points as of flat mve shock shock flat shock these results indicate that given a flat balance sheet scenario  and if deposit rates track general interest rate changes by approximately  the company s balance sheet is neutral to slightly liability sensitive over a twelve month time horizon 
neutral sensitivity implies that net interest income does not change when interest rates change 
liability sensitive implies that net interest income decreases when interest rates rise  and increase when interest rates decrease 
the magnitude of all the simulation results noted above is within the bank s policy guidelines 
the asset liability management policy limits aggregate market risk  as measured in this fashion  to an acceptable level within the context of risk return trade offs 
the simulation results noted above do not incorporate any management actions that might moderate the negative consequences of interest rate deviations 
in addition  the simulation results noted above contain various assumptions such as a flat balance sheet  and the rate that deposit interest rates change as general interest rates change 
therefore  they do not reflect likely actual results  but serve as estimates of interest rate risk 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the preceding tables 
for example  although certain of the bank s assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing time frames  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
in addition  the interest rates on certain of the bank s asset and liability categories may precede  or lag behind  changes in market interest rates 
also  the actual rates of prepayments on loans and investments could vary significantly from the assumptions utilized in deriving the results as presented in the preceding tables 
further  a change in us treasury rates accompanied by a change in the shape of the treasury yield curve could result in different estimations from those presented herein 
accordingly  the results in the preceding tables should not be 
table of contents relied upon as indicative of actual results in the event of changing market interest rates 
additionally  the resulting estimates of changes in market value of equity are not intended to represent  and should not be construed to represent  estimates of changes in the underlying value of the bank 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the bank s portfolio of assets and liabilities 
one aspect of these repricing characteristics is the time frame within which the interest bearing assets and liabilities are subject to change in interest rates either at replacement  repricing or maturity 
an analysis of the repricing time frames of interest bearing assets and liabilities is sometimes called a gap analysis because it shows the gap between assets and liabilities repricing or maturing in each of a number of periods 
another aspect of these repricing characteristics is the relative magnitude of the repricing for each category of interest earning asset and interest bearing liability given various changes in market interest rates 
gap analysis gives no indication of the relative magnitude of repricing given various changes in interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity of assets and liabilities and their repricing during periods of changes in market interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity gaps are measured as the difference between the volumes of assets and liabilities in the bank s current portfolio that are subject to repricing at various time horizons 
the following interest rate sensitivity table shows the bank s repricing gaps as of december  in this table transaction deposits  which may be repriced at will by the bank  have been included in the less than month category 
the inclusion of all of the transaction deposits in the less than month repricing category causes the bank to appear liability sensitive 
because the bank may reprice its transaction deposits at will  transaction deposits may or may not reprice immediately with changes in interest rates 
due to the limitations of gap analysis  as described above  the bank does not actively use gap analysis in managing interest rate risk 
instead  the bank relies on the more sophisticated interest rate risk simulation model described above as its primary tool in measuring and managing interest rate risk
