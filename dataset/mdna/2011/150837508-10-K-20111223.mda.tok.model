item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
cel sci s lead investigational therapy  multikine  is cleared for a phase iii clinical trial in advanced primary head and neck cancer 
it has received a go ahead by the us fda as well as the canadian  polish  hungarian  russian  israeli  indian and taiwanese regulators 
cel sci also owns and is developing a pre clinical technology called leaps ligand epitope antigen presentation system 
all of cel sci s projects are under development 
as a result  cel sci cannot predict when it will be able to generate any revenue from the sale of any of its products 
since inception  cel sci has financed its operations through the issuance of equity securities  convertible notes  loans and certain research grants 
cel sci s expenses will likely exceed its revenues as it continues the development of multikine and brings other drug candidates into clinical trials 
until such time as cel sci becomes profitable  any or all of these financing vehicles or others may be utilized to assist cel sci s capital requirements 
results of operations fiscal during the year ended september   revenue increased by  in november  cel sci received a  grant under the patient protection and affordable care act of ppaca 
the grant was related to three of cel sci s projects  including the phase iii trial of multikine 
the ppaca provides small and mid sized biotech  pharmaceutical and medical device companies with up to a tax credit for investments in qualified therapeutic discoveries for tax years and  or a grant for the same amount tax free 
the tax credit grant program covers research and development costs from and for all qualified therapeutic discovery projects 
cel sci recognizes revenue as the expenses are incurred 
additionally  cel sci has received  from a phase iii clinical trial partner for participation in the phase iii clinical trial 
during the year ended september   research and development expenses decreased by  compared to fiscal cel sci s research and development expenses will fluctuate based on the activity level of its phase iii clinical trial 
during the year ended september   general and administrative expenses increased by  compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in legal fees for the lawsuit 
during the year ended september   other expenses increased by million  compared to fiscal this increase was due to the million settlement of the lawsuit 
the settlement agreement  signed in may  between cel sci and thirteen hedge funds the plaintiffs resolved all claims arising from a lawsuit initiated by the plaintiffs in october as previously disclosed by cel sci in its public filings  in august the plaintiffs or their predecessors purchased from cel sci series k notes convertible into cel sci s common stock and series k warrants to purchase cel sci s common stock under agreements which provided the series k notes and warrants with anti dilution protection if cel sci sold additional shares of common stock  or securities convertible into common stock  at a price below the then applicable conversion price of the notes or the exercise price of the warrants 
in their lawsuit  the plaintiffs alleged that a march drug marketing and distribution agreement in which cel sci sold units of common stock and warrants to an unrelated third party triggered these anti dilution provisions  and that cel sci failed to give effect to these provisions 
the plaintiffs sought million in actual damages  million in punitive damages  the issuance of additional shares of common stock and warrants  and a reduction in the conversion price of the series k notes and the exercise price of the series k warrants 
cel sci denied the plaintiffs allegations in the lawsuit and asserted that the agreement was a strategic transaction which did not trigger the anti dilution provisions of the financing agreements 
although cel sci believed the plaintiffs claims were without merit  cel sci was of the opinion that a settlement of the lawsuit was in the best interests of its shareholders 
the settlement was entered into to avoid the substantial costs of further litigation and the risk and uncertainty that the litigation entails 
by ending this dispute  and ending the significant demands on the time and attention of cel sci s management necessary to respond to the litigation  cel sci is better able to focus on executing its ongoing phase iii clinical trial with its investigational cancer drug multikine 
under the terms of the settlement agreement and related agreements  the plaintiffs and cel sci terminated the pending litigation and released each other from all claims each may have had against the other  with certain customary exceptions 
cel sci agreed to make a million cash payment and issue convertible promissory notes in the principal amount of million and  shares of series a preferred stock 
as of september  cel sci had redeemed all of the series a preferred shares for approximately  as a result  all series a preferred shares have been cancelled and are no longer outstanding 
the notes will be redeemed through five monthly installment payments of approximately million each  plus interest at the rate of per annum  with payments beginning on november  and ending on march  the notes are convertible  at the option of the holders  into cel sci s common stock at a fixed price of per share 
the first and second payments were made on november and december  per the settlement agreement 
cel sci has pledged all of its assets as collateral for the repayment of the notes 
while the notes are outstanding  cel sci is generally prohibited from paying dividends  incurring new debt or making any payments other than interest on existing debt  and is subject to certain restrictions on the transfer of its assets 
as of november   the remaining series k warrants allow the holders to purchase up to  shares of cel sci s common stock at a price of per share at any time prior to february  if cel sci sells any additional shares of common stock or any securities convertible into common stock at a price below  the warrant exercise price will be lowered to the price at which the shares were sold or the lowest price at which the securities are convertible  as the case may be 
the parties respective obligations under the settlement agreement  including cel sci obligation to pay cash and issue notes and preferred shares to the plaintiffs  were subject to obtaining court approval of an order exempting the issuance to the plaintiffs of the notes and preferred shares from registration under section a of the securities act of this was to permit the notes  and the shares of common stock issuable upon any conversion of the notes  to be freely tradeable 
as a condition of the settlement agreement  all claims against cel sci were dismissed 
as a result  the  overpayment by one of the claimants was dismissed and the liability was written off during the three months ended june  the foregoing summary of the settlement is qualified in its entirety by the detailed terms of the settlement agreement and the related agreements and documents which were filed as exhibits to cel sci s report on form q for the three months ended march  interest income during the year ended september  decreased by  compared to fiscal the decrease was due to the decrease in the funds available for investment and lower interest rates 
the gain on derivative instruments of  for the year ended september  was the result of the change in fair value of the derivative liabilities during the period 
the interest expense of  for the year ended september  was interest on the loan from cel sci s president  the dividends paid on the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock  that are considered to be interest in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and accrued interest on the convertible notes 
the interest expense of  for the year ended september  was interest on the loan from cel sci s president  offset by the final  in amortization of the loan premium in october  fiscal during the year ended september   research and development expenses increased by  compared to the year ended september  this increase was due to continuing expenses relating to the preparation for the phase iii clinical trial on multikine 
during the year ended september   general and administrative expenses increased by  compared to the year ended september   primarily due to legal fees caused by the iroquois lawsuit 
interest income during the year ended september  increased by  compared to the year ended september  the increase was due to the greater amount of capital cel sci had for investment in money market funds 
the gain on derivative instruments of  for the year ended september   was the result of the change in the fair value of the derivative liabilities on the balance sheet 
the series a e warrants issued in conjunction with several financings during the fiscal year ended september   as well as others are considered derivative liabilities and must be valued at the end of each period 
the fluctuation of the price of cel sci s common stock is a major cause of derivative gains or losses 
the interest expense of  for the year ended september  was interest on the related party loan 
previous years included amortization of the series k discount and the premium on the related party loan 
research and development expenses during the five years ended september  cel sci s research and development efforts involved multikine and leaps 
the table below shows the research and development expenses associated with each project during this five year period 
multikine    leaps     total     in january  cel sci received a no objection letter from the fda indicating that it could proceed with phase iii trials with multikine in head neck cancer patients 
cel sci had previously received a no objection letter from the canadian biologics and genetic therapies directorate which enabled cel sci to begin its phase iii clinical trial in canada 
subsequently  cel sci received go ahead from the polish  hungarian  russian  israeli  indian and taiwanese regulators 
cel sci s phase iii clinical trial began in december after the completion and validation of cel sci s dedicated manufacturing facility 
as explained in item of this report  as of november   cel sci was involved in a number of pre clinical studies with respect to its leaps technology 
as with multikine  cel sci does not know what obstacles it will encounter in future pre clinical and clinical studies involving its leaps technology 
consequently  cel sci cannot predict with any certainty the funds required for future research and clinical trials and the timing of future research and development projects 
clinical and other studies necessary to obtain regulatory approval of a new drug involve significant costs and require several years to complete 
the extent of cel sci s clinical trials and research programs are primarily based upon the amount of capital available to cel sci and the extent to which cel sci has received regulatory approvals for clinical trials 
the inability of cel sci to conduct clinical trials or research  whether due to a lack of capital or regulatory approval  will prevent cel sci from completing the studies and research required to obtain regulatory approval for any products which cel sci is developing 
without regulatory approval  cel sci will be unable to sell any of its products 
liquidity and capital resources cel sci has had only limited revenues from operations since its inception in march cel sci has relied upon capital generated from the public and private offerings of its common stock and convertible notes 
in addition  cel sci has utilized short term loans to meet its capital requirements 
capital raised by cel sci has been expended primarily to acquire an exclusive worldwide license to use  and later purchase  certain patented and unpatented proprietary technology and know how relating to the human immunological defense system 
capital has also been used for patent applications  debt repayment  research and development  administrative costs  and the construction of cel sci s laboratory facilities 
cel sci does not anticipate realizing significant revenues until it enters into licensing arrangements regarding its technology and know how or until it receives regulatory approval to sell its products which could take a number of years 
as a result cel sci has been dependent upon the proceeds from the sale of its securities to meet all of its liquidity and capital requirements and anticipates having to do so in the future 
cel sci will be required to raise additional capital or find additional long term financing in order to continue with its research efforts 
the ability of cel sci to complete the necessary clinical trials and obtain federal drug administration fda approval for the sale of products to be developed on a commercial basis is uncertain 
ultimately  cel sci must complete the development of its products  obtain the appropriate regulatory approvals and obtain sufficient revenues to support its cost structure 
cel sci believes that  counting its cash on hand and access to the capital markets established over the years  it will have enough capital to support its operations for more than the next twelve months 
the cash required to pay cel sci s outstanding convertible notes in the principal amount of million as of december   will be dependent on the price of cel sci s common stock prior to march   the maturity date of the notes 
if cel sci s stock price is above  which is the conversion price of the notes  the notes may be converted into cel sci common stock  in which case the notes  or part of the notes  will be retired without the payment of cash 
cel sci has two partners who have agreed to participate in and pay for part of the phase iii clinical trial for multikine 
on december   cel sci announced that it had commenced the phase iii clinical trial for multikine 
the net cost to cel sci of the phase iii clinical trial is estimated to be million 
in august  cel sci leased a building near baltimore  maryland 
the building  which consists of approximately  square feet  has been remodeled in accordance with cel sci s specifications so that it can be used by cel sci to manufacture multikine for cel sci s phase iii clinical trials and sales of the drug if approved by the fda 
the lease expires on october   and requires annual base rent payments of approximately  during the twelve months ending september  see item of this report for more information concerning the terms of this lease 
on august   cel sci sold  shares of common stock and  warrants in a private financing for  the shares were sold at  a significant premium over the closing price of cel sci common stock 
in june  an additional  shares and  warrants were issued to the investors as a result of a subsequent financing 
in october  an additional  shares and  warrants were issued to the investors as a result of a subsequent financing 
each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of cel sci common stock at a price of per share at any time prior to august  on march   cel sci sold  units as further consideration under a licensing agreement with an unrelated third party at a price of per unit  or  in total 
each unit consisted of one share of cel sci common stock and two warrants 
each warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of cel sci common stock at a price of per share 
the warrants are exercisable at any time prior to march  between june and july   cel sci sold  shares of its common stock at a price of per share totaling  the investors in this offering also received  series a warrants 
each series a warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of cel sci s common stock 
the series a warrants may be exercised at any time on or after december  and on or prior to december  at a price of per share 
as of september    series a warrants had been exercised 
the remaining series a warrants allow the holders to purchase up to  shares of cel sci s common stock 
on july   cel sci borrowed  from two institutional investors 
the loans were repaid on september  the series b note holders also received series b warrants which allow the holders to purchase up to  shares of cel sci s common stock at a price of per share 
the series b warrants may be exercised at any time on or after march  and on or prior to september  on august   cel sci sold  shares of its common stock to a group of private investors for  or per share 
the investors also received series c warrants which entitle the investors to purchase  shares of cel sci s common stock 
the series c warrants may be exercised at any time on or after february  and on or prior to february  at a price of per share 
as of september    series c warrants had been exercised 
the remaining series c warrants allow the holders to purchase up to  shares of cel sci s common stock 
on september   cel sci sold  shares of its common stock to a group of private investors for  or per share 
the investors also received series d warrants which entitle the investors to purchase up to  shares of cel sci s common stock 
the series d warrants may be exercised at any time prior to september   at a price of per share 
on september    series d warrants expired 
in addition  the broker for the placement agent received  series e warrants 
the series e warrants may be exercised at any time prior to august   at a price of 
between december and june  maximilian de clara  cel sci s president and a director  loaned cel sci  the loan was initially payable at the end of march  but was extended to the end of june at the time the loan was due  and in accordance with the loan agreement  cel sci issued mr 
de clara a warrant which entitles mr 
de clara to purchase  shares of cel sci s common stock at a price of per share 
the warrant is exercisable at any time prior to december  although the loan was to be repaid from the proceeds of cel sci s recent financing  cel sci s directors deemed it beneficial not to repay the loan and negotiated a second extension of the loan with mr 
de clara on terms similar to the june financing 
pursuant to the terms of the second extension the note was due on july   but  at mr 
de clara s option  the loan can be converted into shares of cel sci s common stock 
subsequently  on may   to recognize mr 
de clara s willingness to agree to subordinate his note to the convertible preferred shares and convertible debt as part of the settlement agreement  the company extended the maturity date of the note to july  the number of shares which will be issued upon any conversion will be determined by dividing the amount to be converted by 
as further consideration for the second extension  mr 
de clara received warrants which allow mr 
de clara to purchase  shares of cel sci s common stock at a price of per share at any time prior to january  the loan from mr 
de clara bears interest at per year and is secured by a lien on substantially all of cel sci s assets 
cel sci does not have the right to prepay the loan without mr 
de clara s consent 
between july  and september   cel sci received approximately  from the exercise of stock options and other warrants including a number of cel sci s series a  j  k and l warrants previously issued to private investors 
on december  cel sci entered into a sales agreement with mcnicoll lewis vlak llc relating to the sale of shares of its common stock which have been registered by means of a registration statement cel sci filed with the securities and exchange commission in july in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement  cel sci may offer and sell shares of its common stock through mcnicoll lewis vlak acting as cel sci s agent 
cel sci may also sell its common stock to mcnicoll lewis vlak  as principal for its own account  at a price negotiated at the time of sale 
on december  cel sci  per the terms of the agreement  exercised its right to terminate the agreement 
sales of cel sci s common stock  if any  may be made in sales deemed to be at the market equity offerings  including sales made directly on or through the nyse amex  sales made to or through a market maker other than on an exchange  in negotiated transactions at market prices prevailing at the time of sale or at prices related to prevailing market prices  and or any other method permitted by law 
cel sci is not required to sell any shares to mcnicoll lewis vlak and mcnicoll lewis vlak is not required to sell any shares on cel sci s behalf or purchase any of cel sci s shares for its own account 
mcnicoll lewis vlak is entitled to a commission in an amount equal to the greater of of the gross proceeds from each sale of the shares  or for each share sold  provided  that  in no event will mcnicoll lewis vlak receive a commission greater than of the gross proceeds from the sale of the shares 
during the year ended september  cel sci sold  shares of its common stock to mcnicoll lewis vlak for  net of commissions and fees of  and attorney fees of  inventory increased by approximately  in the fiscal year ended september  as cel sci continued to purchase supplies for the manufacturing of multikine for the phase iii trial 
in addition  prepaids increased by approximately  due to prepayment of certain phase iii clinical trial expenses 
in may  cel sci settled a lawsuit which had been filed in october pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement  cel sci paid the plaintiffs  in cash and issued securities with a face value of  to the plaintiffs 
see the discussion above pertaining to of the results of operation for fiscal for more information concerning the settlement and cel sci s obligation to repay notes in the principal amount of  as part of the settlement 
during the year ended september   cel sci s cash decreased by  significant components of this decrease include approximately million paid towards the settlement of the lawsuit  approximately million for the defense of the lawsuit  million in prepayments for the phase iii clinical trial which cel sci expects to be used during fiscal year and research and development expenses of million and administrative expenses  excluding the lawsuit settlement  of million 
during the year ended september  cel sci also received million from the sale of stock and exercise of stock options and warrants 
in october  cel sci sold  shares of its common stock to private investors for  or per share 
the investors also received  series f warrants 
each series f warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of cel sci s common stock at a price of per share at any time prior to october  cel sci paid the placement agent for this offering a commission consisting of  in cash and  series g warrants 
each series g warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of cel sci s common stock at a price of per share at any time prior to august future capital requirements cel sci is currently running a large multi national phase iii clinical trial for head and neck cancer 
head and neck cancer accounts for about of the world s annual cancer cases 
this study  if successful  should address a major unmet medical need of a very large scale 
therefore the positive outcome of this trial carries the potential for a great amount of financial upside for shareholders 
it is for this reason that cel sci should have many avenues of funding available to it throughout the phase iii clinical trial 
during  cel sci used an at the market atm transaction to raise money and  separately  raised money in a direct placement of shares and warrants to investors 
while cel sci cancelled the atm in december  management believes  based on current offers  that it could start the atm again  if needed 
cel sci is also offered  on a regular basis  other financings 
management believes that  particularly under the current market conditions  it is imperative to be flexible to achieve the best outcome for the shareholders 
therefore  cel sci expects that it will raise additional capital in fiscal year in the form of corporate partnerships  debt and or equity financings to support its operations at its current rate 
cel sci believes that it will be able to obtain additional financing since multikine is a phase iii product designed to treat cancer  an area that pharmaceutical companies are increasingly targeting 
however  as stated in the cel sci risk factors  there is no assurance that funds will be available to cel sci 
it is important to note that cel sci s expenditures for fiscal year included several very large non recurring expenses that amounted to approximately million dollars  mostly related to the lawsuit and the settlement of the lawsuit 
these expenses  with the exception of the settlement payments through march   will not recur in fiscal year  thereby reducing cel sci s expenditures significantly 
in general  cel sci believes that it will be able to raise sufficient capital in to expand the phase iii trial and continue operations through december however  it is possible that cel sci will not be able to generate enough cash to continue operations at its current level 
cel sci registered independent public accounting firm has issued an audit opinion that includes an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about cel sci s ability to continue as a going concern mainly due to continued losses from operations and future liquidity needs of cel sci 
cel sci s management has engaged in fundraising for over years and believes that the manner in which it is proceeding will produce the best possible outcome for the shareholders 
there can be no assurances that cel sci will be successful in raising additional funds 
other than funding operating losses  funding its research and development program  and paying its liabilities  cel sci does not have any material capital commitments 
material future liabilities as of september  are as follows years ending september  total thereafter operating leases    employment contracts    convertible notes   interest on notes   for additional information on employment contracts  see item of this report 
further  cel sci has contingent obligations with vendors for work that will be completed in relation to the phase iii trial 
the timing of these obligations cannot be determined at this time 
the amount of these obligations for the phase iii trial is approximately million 
cel sci will need to raise additional funds  either through its existing warrants options  through a debt or equity financing or a partnering arrangement  to complete the phase iii trial and bring multikine to market 
clinical and other studies necessary to obtain regulatory approval of a new drug involve significant costs and require several years to complete 
the extent of cel sci s clinical trials and research programs are primarily based upon the amount of capital available to cel sci and the extent to which cel sci has received regulatory approvals for clinical trials 
the inability of cel sci to conduct clinical trials or research  whether due to a lack of capital or regulatory approval  will prevent cel sci from completing the studies and research required to obtain regulatory approval for any products which cel sci is developing 
without regulatory approval  cel sci will be unable to sell any of its products 
in the absence of revenues  cel sci will be required to raise additional funds through the sale of securities  debt financing or other arrangements in order to continue with its research efforts 
however  there can be no assurance that such financing will be available or be available on favorable terms 
ultimately  cel sci must complete the development of its products  obtain appropriate regulatory approvals and obtain sufficient revenues to support its cost structure 
since all of cel sci s projects are under development cel sci cannot predict with any certainty the funds required for future research and clinical trials  the timing of future research and development projects  or when it will be able to generate any revenue from the sale of any of its products 
cel sci cash flow and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates on its bank accounts  and  to an immaterial extent  foreign currency exchange rates 
critical accounting policies cel sci significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included as part of this report 
however  certain accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgments by management 
as a result  the consolidated financial statements are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying those policies  management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
these estimates are based on cel sci historical experience  terms of existing contracts  observance of trends in the industry and information available from outside sources  as appropriate 
cel sci s significant accounting policies include patents patent expenditures are capitalized and amortized using the straight line method over years 
in the event changes in technology or other circumstances impair the value or life of the patent  appropriate adjustment in the asset value and period of amortization is made 
an impairment loss is recognized when estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset  and from disposition  is less than the carrying value of the asset 
the amount of the impairment loss is the difference between the estimated fair value of the asset and its carrying value 
stock options and warrants effective october   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of asc using the prospective transition method which requires the company to apply the provisions of asc only to awards granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled after october  compensation cost for all stock based awards after october  is measured at fair value as of the grant date in accordance with the provisions of asc the fair value of the stock options is calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model requires various judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates and expected option life 
the stock based compensation cost is recognized on the accelerated method as expense over the requisite service or vesting period 
options to non employees are accounted for in accordance with codification s accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
accordingly  compensation is recognized when goods or services are received and is measured using the black scholes valuation model 
the black scholes model requires cel sci s management to make assumptions regarding the fair value of the options at the date of grant and the expected life of the options 
asset valuations and review for potential impairments cel sci reviews its fixed assets  intangibles and deferred rent every fiscal quarter 
this review requires that cel sci make assumptions regarding the value of these assets and the changes in circumstances that would affect the carrying value of these assets 
if such analysis indicates that a possible impairment may exist  cel sci is then required to estimate the fair value of the asset and  as deemed appropriate  expense all or a portion of the asset 
the determination of fair value includes numerous uncertainties  such as the impact of competition on future value 
cel sci believes that it has made reasonable estimates and judgments in determining whether its long lived assets have been impaired  however  if there is a material change in the assumptions used in its determination of fair values or if there is a material change in economic conditions or circumstances influencing fair value  cel sci could be required to recognize certain impairment charges in the future 
as a result of the reviews  no changes in asset values were required 
prepaid expenses and inventory inventory consists of bulk purchases of laboratory supplies used on a daily basis in the lab and items that will be used for future production 
the items in inventory are expensed when used in production or daily activity as research and development expenses 
these items are disposables and consumables and can be used for both the manufacturing of multikine for clinical studies and in the laboratory for quality control and bioassay use 
they can be used in training  testing and daily laboratory activities 
prepaid expenses are payments for services over a long period and are expensed over the time period for which the service is rendered 
derivative instruments cel sci enters into financing arrangements that consist of freestanding derivative instruments or hybrid instruments that contain embedded derivative features 
cel sci accounts for these arrangement in accordance with codification  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company own stock  as well as related interpretations of these standards 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  derivative instruments and hybrid instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and are measured at fair value with gains or losses recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the derivative or hybrid instruments 
embedded derivatives that are not clearly and closely related to the host contract are bifurcated and recognized at fair value with changes in fair value recognized as either a gain or loss in earnings if they can be reliably measured 
when the fair value of embedded derivative features cannot be reliably measured  cel sci measures and reports the entire hybrid instrument at fair value with changes in fair value recognized as either a gain or loss in earnings 
cel sci determines the fair value of derivative instruments and hybrid instruments based on available market data using appropriate valuation models  giving consideration to all of the rights and obligations of each instrument and precluding the use of blockage discounts or premiums in determining the fair value of a large block of financial instruments 
fair value under these conditions does not necessarily represent fair value determined using valuation standards that give consideration to blockage discounts and other factors that may be considered by market participants in establishing fair value 
accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurements and disclosures  which requires new disclosures for transfers in and out of level and level and activity in level of the fair value hierarchy 
asu requires separate disclosure of the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and a description of the reasons for the transfers 
in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using level inputs  a reporting entity should present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements 
asu is effective for new disclosures and clarification of existing disclosures for interim and annual periods beginning after december  except for disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the level activity rollforward  which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on its financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss  which is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the asu is mainly the result of the joint efforts by the fasb and the international accounting standards board to develop a single  converged fair value framework on how to measure fair value and common disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
the asu amends various fair value guidance such as requiring the highest and best use and valuation premise concepts only to measuring the fair value of nonfinancial assets and prohibits the use of blockage factors and control premiums when measuring fair value 
in addition  the asu expands disclosure requirements particularly for level inputs and requires disclosure of the level in the fair value hierarchy of items that are not measured at fair value in the statement of financial position but whose fair value must be disclosed 
the company does not believe that this amendment will have a material impact on its financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s market risk is the potential change in an instrument value caused by  for example  fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
cel sci enters into financing arrangements that are or include freestanding derivative instruments or that are  or include  hybrid instruments that contain embedded derivative features 
cel sci does not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes 
additional information is presented in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of these instruments is affected primarily by volatility of the trading prices of the cel sci s common stock 
for three years ended september   cel sci recognized a gain or loss of   and  respectively  resulting from changes in fair value of derivative instruments 
cel sci has exposure to risks associated with foreign exchange rate changes because some of the expenses related to the phase iii trial are transacted in a foreign currency 
the interest risk on investments on september  was considered immaterial due to the fact that the interest rates at that time were nominal at best and cel sci keeps its cash and cash equivalents in short term maturities
