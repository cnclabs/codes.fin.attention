table of contents fiscal year net earnings for fiscal increased to  or per diluted share  from net earnings for fiscal of  or per diluted share 
fiscal net earnings includes  excluding the income tax effect  or per diluted share  associated with the consolidation of the saco  maine operations into the memphis  tennessee facility  and  excluding the income tax effect  or per diluted share  related to costs incurred in connection with the reorganization of our sales and marketing leadership during the second quarter of fiscal fiscal net earnings  on the other hand  includes  or per diluted share  of bioline group transaction costs 
results of operations for fiscal compared to fiscal are discussed below 
non gaap information the tables below provide information on net earnings  basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share  excluding the effect of costs associated with the consolidation of our saco  maine operations into our memphis  tennessee facility fiscal  costs of reorganizing our sales and marketing leadership fiscal and transaction costs associated with the acquisition of the bioline group fiscal  each of which is a non gaap financial measure  as well as reconciliations to amounts reported under us generally accepted accounting principles 
we believe that this information is useful to those who read our financial statements and evaluate our operating results because these measures help to appropriately evaluate and compare the results of operations from period to period by removing the impact of non routine costs related to consolidating the maine operations fiscal and reorganizing our sales and marketing leadership fiscal  and the one time transaction costs related to the acquisition of the bioline group fiscal  and these measures are used by our management for various purposes  including evaluating performance against incentive bonus achievement targets  comparing performance from period to period in presentations to our board of directors  and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting

revenue overview our diagnostics operating segments provide the largest share of our consolidated revenues   and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the percentage decline from fiscal to results primarily from the addition of the bioline group to our life science operating segment 
sales from our focus families c 
difficile  foodborne and h 
pylori comprised of our diagnostics operating segments revenues during fiscal the overall revenue change for our diagnostics operating segments during fiscal was an increase of  reflecting growth in all of our focus product families 
the levels of growth ranged from in our h 
pylori products to in our foodborne products family 
c

on an organic basis  which excludes the effects of currency translation  sales of our european diagnostic operating segment decreased by in fiscal  reflecting the combined effects of decreases in our c 
difficile  respiratory and h 
pylori product families  partially offset by growth in our foodborne product sales 

table of contents c 
difficile products our illumigene molecular c 
difficile product has now been available in markets around the world for over months 
sales of this product were approximately  and in fiscal and  respectively 
we have just over placements of illumigene units worldwide to date  with approximately of these installed in the us at the present time  it generally takes a customer days from purchase order placement to become revenue producing a timeframe we are continually working to reduce 
our illumigene molecular c 
difficile product has restored the c 
difficile product family to positive sales growth  in fiscal  and has allowed us to begin to recover lost test volume from our toxin products 
our major competitors in this product family are cepheid and becton dickinson 
we believe that we have two principal advantages versus our competition 
first  our instrumentation package has a smaller footprint and significantly lower cost than either cepheid or becton dickinson 
we believe that this advantage allows our product to fit into virtually any size hospital or reference laboratory 
we believe that our second principal advantage is the breadth of our c 
difficile product offerings 
with the launch of our molecular product and recent fda clearance and submission activities related to our common antigen c 
difficile products premier c 
difficile gdh received fda clearance in may  and immunocard c 
difficile gdh was submitted to the fda in july we believe we are in a unique position to offer a full line of testing solutions to our clinical laboratory customers around the world to counter the competitive pressures surrounding this market 
additionally  we hold the only fda approved claim for c 
difficile testing in the pediatric population 
during july  we submitted to the fda our second molecular test for the illumigene molecular platform  illumigene group b streptococcus gbs  and over the next months  we expect the following additional tests for the platform group a streptococcus  mycoplasma pneumoniae and bordetella pertussis parapertussis to clear formal clinical trials and be submitted to the fda for marketing clearance 
foodborne products during fiscal  sales of our foodborne products increased approximately for our us diagnostics operating segment and approximately for our european diagnostics operating segment on an organic basis 
as was experienced in fiscal  the revenue increases in this product family continue to reflect the volume growth in our new foodborne products launched in recent years 
additionally  the european diagnostics operating segment s growth reflects the effects of the enterohemorrhagic e 
coli ehec infection outbreak in europe during the third quarter of fiscal the market acceptance and volume growth of these products has resulted in global revenues for this disease family growing nearly five fold since fiscal  with foodborne fast approaching a  product family 
we believe that the primary competition for our foodborne products is laboratory culture methods 
we believe that our products have two principal advantages versus culture methods 
the first principal advantage is test accuracy 
independent evaluations have shown our products to have higher sensitivity than culture methods 
the second principal advantage is improved work flow of the testing process  resulting in significantly shortened time to test result 
our single use rapid products provide a test result in approximately minutes  whereas culture results can take up to hours 
time to test result can be a critical factor in the physician s choice of therapies 

table of contents h 
pylori products during fiscal  sales of our h 
pylori products grew for our us diagnostics operating segment and declined for our european diagnostics operating segment on an organic basis  compared to the year over year sales level increases these operating segments experienced in of and  respectively 
the increases for our us diagnostics operating segment continue to reflect the benefits of our partnerships with managed care companies in promoting the health and economic benefits of a test and treat strategy  and the ongoing effects of such strategy moving physician behavior away from serology based testing toward direct antigen testing 
we expect that our efforts with managed care companies in the us will provide low to mid teens growth opportunities for the next several years 
the sales results for our european diagnostics operating segment reflect the ongoing impact of pricing pressures from competitive products in european markets 
respiratory products during fiscal  respiratory sales for our diagnostics operating segments decreased compared to fiscal  following a year over year decrease from fiscal to fiscal the dramatic sales fluctuation for this family is a direct result of the end of the novel a hn outbreak in december total non influenza respiratory product sales remained relatively flat compared to fiscal  with sales of such products decreasing for our us diagnostics operating segment and increasing for our european diagnostics operating segment on an organic basis 
at present  we do not expect a significant revenue contribution from influenza products in fiscal group purchasing organizations in our us diagnostics operating segment  consolidation of the us healthcare industry over the last several years has led to the creation of group purchasing organizations gpos that aggregate buying power for hospital groups and put pressure on our selling prices 
we have multi year supply agreements with several gpos 
during fiscal  we experienced approximately  in unfavorable price variance  as a result of these agreements 
however  these agreements help secure our products with these customers and have led to new business 
while in the near term this has negatively impacted gross profit  further increases in volumes are expected from these contracts 
foreign currency favorable currency exchange rates resulted in approximately of additional revenue being recognized by our european diagnostics operating segment during fiscal  compared to currency exchange rates having virtually no impact on the fiscal consolidated sales results 
during fiscal  currency exchange rates had an approximate  unfavorable impact on revenue 

table of contents life science operating segment sales for our life science operating segment increased in fiscal  due primarily to a  revenue contribution from the bioline group acquired in july excluding the impact of the bioline group  sales for the operating segment declined for the year  as this business continues to experience both pricing pressure and reduced order volumes in bulk antigens  antibodies and related reagents 
for fiscal  we expect overall revenue growth of our life science operating segment to be in the range of to  led by the bioline group  which we expect to generate double digit increases in sales of its molecular reagent products 
we expect sales of our bulk antigen  antibody and reagent products to decline slightly in fiscal due to a slowing immunoassay demand profile 
as a result of the order volume trends in bulk antigens  antibodies and reagents  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced the closure of our saco  maine facility  and began the consolidation of our manufacturing operations from this facility with our memphis  tennessee facility 
we expect the consolidation of manufacturing operations in memphis will provide a lower overall cost structure and should be completed during the second fiscal quarter of total costs to complete the consolidation of facilities are expected to be approximately  consisting of fixed asset impairments  inventory impairments  stay bonuses and moving costs  among other similar items 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized  of these costs  and the balance will be recognized during fiscal  primarily during the first half of the fiscal year 
significant customers our us diagnostic operating segment s sales through two national distributors were of the us diagnostics operating segment s total sales  or of consolidated sales  for fiscal this compares to fiscal  in which sales through these distributors comprised of us diagnostics operating segment sales and of consolidated sales 
the lower percentage of sales reflects the fact that the majority of our illumigene product sales are direct  as well as the comparative decline in these distributors inventory stocking of influenza and other products 
our life science operating segment s sales of purified antigens and reagents to two diagnostic manufacturing customers were of the life science operating segment s total sales for fiscal or of our consolidated sales for fiscal  compared to and of fiscal life science operating segment and consolidated sales  respectively 
the lower percentage of sales results primarily from the addition of the bioline group 

table of contents operating segment revenues our reportable operating segments are us diagnostics  european diagnostics and life science 
the us diagnostics operating segment consists of manufacturing operations in cincinnati  ohio  and the sale and distribution of diagnostic test kits in the us and countries outside of europe  africa and the middle east 
the european diagnostics operating segment consists of the sale and distribution of diagnostic test kits in europe  africa and the middle east 
the life science operating segment consists of manufacturing operations in memphis  tennessee  saco  maine  boca raton  florida  london  england  luckenwalde  germany  and sydney  australia  and the sale and distribution of bulk antigens  antibodies  pcr qpcr reagents  nucleotides  competent cells and bioresearch reagents domestically and abroad 
the life science operating segment also includes the contract development and manufacture of proteins and other biologicals for use by biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies engaged in research for new drugs and vaccines 
revenues for the diagnostics operating segments  in the normal course of business  may be affected by buying patterns of major distributors  seasonality and strength of certain diseases  and foreign currency exchange rates 
revenues for the life science operating segment  in the normal course of business  may be affected by the timing and nature of arrangements for contract services work  which may have longer production cycles than bioresearch reagents and bulk antigens and antibodies  as well as buying patterns of major customers 
we believe that the overall breadth of our product lines serves to reduce the variability in consolidated revenues

sales of respiratory products during fiscal  and were approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated sales 
specifically  sales of the company s influenza products during fiscal  and represented approximately  and  respectively  of consolidated sales 
gpo contracts also impacted our gross profit margins during fiscal and these contracts provide customers with favorable pricing based on purchase volumes of meridian products 
during fiscal  we experienced approximately  in unfavorable price variance  as a result of these agreements 
however  these agreements help secure our products with these customers and have led to new business 
while in the near term this has negatively impacted gross profit  further increases in volumes are expected from these contracts 
our overall operations consist of the sale of diagnostic test kits for various disease states and in alternative test formats  as well as bioresearch reagents  bulk antigens and antibodies  proficiency panels  and contract research and development and contract manufacturing services 
product sales mix shifts  in the normal course of business  can cause the consolidated gross profit margin to fluctuate by several points

the facility consolidation costs incurred to date are comprised primarily of write downs to property  equipment and inventory  and stay bonus costs for personnel scheduled to be terminated at varying times throughout fiscal additional stay bonus costs totaling approximately are expected to be incurred during fiscal  with the majority of such costs to be incurred during the first and second quarters 

table of contents operating expenses for the us diagnostics operating segment increased  for fiscal compared to fiscal and increased for fiscal compared to fiscal the overall net increase in fiscal reflects the combined effects of the following research development overall increase in spending on new product development activities related to products submitted to the fda during the year and planned for submission during fiscal  as well as spending on increased illumigene component qualification activities 
costs include increased personnel related and quality control costs of approximately and  respectively

general administrative the positive effects of overall cost containment and reduction efforts being offset by an approximate increase in stock based compensation during fiscal the overall net increase in the us diagnostics operating segment s expenses during fiscal compared to fiscal reflected the combined effects of i decreased research and development spending as a result of completing the development of our molecular illumigene c 
difficile product  including the illumipro instrument  which was launched during fiscal  and comparatively higher clinical trial costs for certain immunoassay products in  ii decreased sales and marketing expenses due to lower c 
difficile and respiratory product sales resulting in lower bonus and commission costs for our sales organization  and iii increased general and administrative expenses as a result of higher compensation costs  including stock based compensation costs related to time vested restricted stock granted in november operating expenses for the european diagnostics operating segment increased  for fiscal compared to fiscal and increased for fiscal compared to fiscal the fiscal increase was primarily attributable to costs associated with the aforementioned reorganization of our sales and marketing leadership during the fiscal second quarter 
operating expenses for the life science operating segment increased  for fiscal compared to fiscal and increased  for fiscal compared to fiscal  excluding one time transaction costs of  the increase in resulted from the previously noted addition of the bioline group s full year operating expenses and the costs related to consolidating the maine and tennessee facilities 
the increase in resulted primarily from increased salaries and benefits related to filling open positions  increased research and development resource allocations  and the addition of the bioline group s operating expenses of  
table of contents the amount of stock based compensation expense reported for fiscal  and was   and  respectively 
during november  we granted to certain employees restricted stock that was contingent upon meridian achieving a specified net earnings level for fiscal because meridian s fiscal net earnings did not reach the minimum level in  these awards were not earned and no stock based compensation has been recorded for these awards 
in november  we granted restricted shares and restricted share units to certain employees  with half of each employee s grant being time vested restricted shares or restricted share units vesting in total in four years  and the remaining half being subject to attainment of a specified earnings target for fiscal dividends were paid on these shares and units throughout fiscal while the earnings target was not met  on september   the compensation committee of the board of directors chose to convert the performance based restricted shares to time vested restricted shares vesting in total after four years in recognition of the achievement in of several strategic initiatives that position the company for future growth 
expense totaling was recorded in fiscal as a result of this conversion  and is included in the total amount of stock based compensation set forth above 
similarly  in november  we granted restricted shares and restricted share units to certain employees  with half of each employee s grant being time vested restricted shares or restricted share units vesting in full in four years  and the remaining half being subject to attainment of a specified earnings target for fiscal although dividends were paid on these shares and units throughout fiscal  because meridian s net earnings did not reach the minimum level in fiscal  the performance based awards were not earned and no stock based compensation has been recorded for these performance based awards 
operating income operating income decreased and in fiscal and  respectively  as a result of the factors discussed above 
other income and expense interest income was  and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decreases during the periods reflect i lower interest yields in the current interest rate environment  ii the use of cash early in the fiscal fourth quarter to acquire the bioline group  and iii the use of cash in fiscal to fund facility expansions in cincinnati and memphis  and to build illumigene inventory 
the increase in other income  net  during fiscal can primarily be attributed to the addition of the bioline group  as it contributed grant income from a foreign government agency of approximately receipt of grant income to this level  if at all  is not expected to continue in fiscal due to the local country s rules regarding ownership by a us parent 
income taxes the effective rate for income taxes was  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal was primarily attributable to the release of certain reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the passage of the relevant statutes of limitations and the nondeductible nature of bioline acquisition costs 
the effective rate increase in resulted primarily from the non deductible nature of bioline group transaction costs and the expiration of the federal research and experimentation tax credit effective december  
table of contents impact of inflation to the extent feasible  we have consistently followed the practice of adjusting our prices to reflect the impact of inflation on salaries and fringe benefits for employees and the cost of purchased materials and services 
inflation and changing prices did not have a material adverse impact on our gross margin  revenue or operating income in fiscal  and liquidity and capital resources comparative cash flow analysis our cash flow and financing requirements are determined by analyses of operating and capital spending budgets  consideration of acquisition plans  and consideration of common share dividends 
we have historically maintained a credit facility to augment working capital requirements and to respond quickly to acquisition opportunities 
our investment portfolio presently contains overnight repurchase agreements 
we used  from our investment portfolio to complete the acquisition of the bioline group during july we have an investment policy that guides the holdings of our investment portfolio 
our objectives in managing the investment portfolio are to i preserve capital  ii provide sufficient liquidity to meet working capital requirements and fund strategic objectives such as acquisitions  and iii capture a market rate of return commensurate with market conditions and our policy s investment eligibility criteria 
as we look forward  we will continue to manage the holdings of our investment portfolio with preservation of capital being the primary objective 
at the present time  we do not expect current conditions in the financial markets  or overall economic conditions to have a significant impact on our liquidity needs  financial condition  or results of operations  although no assurances can be made in this regard 
we intend to continue to fund our working capital requirements and dividends from current cash flows from operating activities and cash on hand 
we also have additional sources of liquidity through our  bank credit facility  if needed 
to date  except for the italian matter discussed below  we have not experienced any significant deterioration in the aging of our customer accounts receivable nor in our vendors ability to supply raw materials and services and extend normal credit terms 
approximately  of our accounts receivable at september  is due from italian hospital customers whose funding ultimately comes from the italian government 
the magnitude of the sovereign debt crisis in europe  and italy in particular  is significant 
we have experienced a deterioration in the aging of our italian accounts receivable and continue to monitor the situation closely 
our liquidity needs may change if overall economic conditions worsen and or liquidity and credit within the financial markets remains tight for an extended period of time  and such conditions impact the collectability of our customer accounts receivable  or impact credit terms with our vendors  or disrupt the supply of raw materials and services 

table of contents fluctuations in overall stock market valuations may raise questions as to the potential impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets 
our annual goodwill impairment review takes place as of june th each year 
there have been no impairments from these annual reviews 
as of october   our stock price was per share  compared to our book value per share of as of september  this relationship  stock price trading at a x multiple of book value  is an indicator that the fluctuation in overall stock market valuations and its impact on our stock price has not been a triggering event for impairment of our goodwill and other long lived assets 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased to  in fiscal given the relatively consistent level of net earnings  this decrease primarily reflects the effects of net working capital changes related to our investments in illumigene inventory  including instruments  and the timing of payments from customers and payments to suppliers 
net cash used for investing activities was  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal this decrease in cash used primarily results from an approximate  increase in expenditures for property  plant and equipment during fiscal  including significant facility expansions in both cincinnati and memphis  being more than offset by the comparative effects of fiscal including  but not limited to  i the acquisition of the bioline group  net cash used and ii the sale of our student loan auction rate securities  net cash received 
net cash used for financing activities was  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a increase in dividend payments being more than offset by an increase in proceeds and tax benefits from the exercise of stock options 
net cash flows from operating activities and cash on hand are anticipated to be adequate to fund working capital requirements  capital expenditures and dividends during the next twelve months 
during the last seven fiscal quarters  the per share amount of our cash dividend has exceeded the per share amount of our diluted earnings 
during fiscal  management expects that this relationship will change  meaning the per share amount of our diluted earnings will exceed the per share amount of our current cash dividend  although no assurances can be made in this regard 

table of contents capital resources we have a  credit facility with a commercial bank which expires september  as of november   there were no borrowings outstanding on this facility and we had borrowing capacity available to us 
we have had no borrowings outstanding under this facility during fiscal or our capital expenditures are estimated to range between approximately  to  for fiscal  with the actual amount depending upon actual operating results and the phasing of certain projects 
such expenditures may be funded with cash and equivalents on hand  operating cash flows  and or availability under the  credit facility discussed above 
known contractual obligations known contractual obligations and their related due dates were as follows as of september  less than more than total year years years years operating leases purchase obligations uncertain income tax positions liability and interest total meridian and its subsidiaries are lessees of i office and warehouse buildings in cincinnati  boston  florida  australia  belgium  france  holland  germany and the uk  ii automobiles for use by the diagnostic direct sales forces in the us and europe  and iii certain office equipment such as facsimile machines and copier machines across all business units  under operating lease agreements that expire at various dates 
meridian s purchase obligations are primarily outstanding purchase orders for inventory and service items 
these contractual commitments are not in excess of expected production requirements over the next twelve months 
as of september   our liabilities for uncertain tax positions and related interest and penalties were and  respectively 
due to inherent uncertainties in the timing of settlement of tax positions  we are unable to estimate the timing of the effective settlement of these obligations 
other commitments and off balance sheet arrangements license agreements meridian has entered into various license agreements that require payment of royalties based on a specified percentage of sales of related products to 
meridian expects that payments under these agreements will amount to approximately  in fiscal these royalty payments primarily relate to the us diagnostics operating segment 
meridian entered into a license agreement in october with a third party that provides rights to a molecular technology for infectious disease testing in the united states  europe and other geographic markets 
the agreement  as amended  calls for remaining payments of up to approximately  based on the achievement of certain product development milestones and on going royalties once products are available for commercial sale 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
market risk exposure foreign currency risk we have market risk exposure related to foreign currency transactions 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk related to our european distribution operations where the billing currency is the euro for most of our customers in these markets 
we also are exposed to foreign currency risk related to the supply of certain diagnostic test kits by manufacturers located in germany and spain 
these foreign currency risks are opposite one another  providing a natural hedge with respect to consolidated gross profit and operating income 
additionally  as a result of the july bioline group acquisition  we are exposed to foreign currency risks related to the bioline group s operations in australia australian dollar  germany euro  and the uk british pound 
assessing foreign currency exposures is a component of our overall ongoing risk management process  with such currency risks managed as we believe appropriate

such accounting principles require management to make judgments about estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
management believes that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding the accompanying consolidated financial statements because the application of such polices requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions and the carrying values of related assets and liabilities are material 

table of contents revenue recognition our revenues are derived primarily from product sales 
revenue is generally recognized from sales when product is shipped and title has passed to the buyer 
revenue for the us diagnostics operating segment is reduced at the date of sale for estimated rebates that will be claimed by customers 
rebate agreements are in place with certain independent national distributors and are designed to reimburse such distributors for their cost in handling our products 
management estimates accruals for rebate agreements based on data provided by these customers  estimates of inventories of our products held by these customers  historical statistics  current trends and other factors 
changes to the accruals are recorded in the period that they become known 
revenue for our diagnostics operating segments includes bundled product revenue for our illumigene molecular test system 
the bundled product includes an instrument  instrument accessories and test kits 
if not sold outright  amounts invoiced for the illumigene test kits cover the instrument  accessories and test kits 
revenue is recognized based on kit sales 
if not sold outright  costs for the instruments are recognized in cost of sales over the period that we have a pricing agreement in effect with the customer  generally three years 
life science revenue for contract services may come from research and development services or manufacturing services  including process development work  or a combination of both 
revenue is recognized based on each of the deliverables in a given arrangement having distinct and separate customer pricing 
pricing is often subject to a competitive bidding process 
contract research and development services may be performed on a time and materials basis or fixed fee basis 
for time and materials arrangements  revenue is recognized as services are performed and billed 
for fixed fee arrangements  revenue is recognized upon completion and acceptance by the customer 
for contract manufacturing services  revenue is generally recognized upon delivery of product and acceptance by the customer 
in some cases  customers may request that we store on their behalf  clinical grade biologicals that we produce under contract manufacturing agreements 
these cases arise when customers do not have clinical grade storage facilities or do not want to risk contamination during transport 
for such cases  revenue may be recognized on a bill and hold basis 
no such bill and hold arrangements existed at september  or september  inventories our inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on a first in  first out fifo basis for substantially all of our inventories 
we establish reserves against cost for excess and obsolete materials  finished goods whose shelf life may expire before sale to customers  and other identified exposures 
management estimates these reserves based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions were to be less favorable than such estimates  additional inventory write downs would be required and recorded in the period known 
such adjustments would negatively affect gross profit margin and overall results of operations 

table of contents intangible assets our intangible assets include identifiable intangibles and goodwill 
identifiable intangibles include customer lists  supply agreements  manufacturing technologies  patents  licenses and trade names 
all of meridian s identifiable intangibles have finite lives 
goodwill is subject to an annual impairment review or more frequently if impairment indicators arise by applying a fair value based test 
there have been no impairments from these analyses 
identifiable intangibles with finite lives are subject to impairment testing 
identifiable intangibles with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that such assets may not be recoverable at their current carrying value 
whether an event or circumstance triggers impairment is determined by comparing an estimate of the asset s undiscounted future cash flows to its carrying value 
if impairment has occurred  it is measured by a fair value based test 
there were no events or circumstances in fiscal  or indicating that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
our ability to recover intangible assets  both identifiable intangibles and goodwill  is dependent upon the future cash flows of the related acquired businesses and assets 
management is required to make judgments and assumptions regarding future cash flows  including sales levels  gross profit margins  operating expense levels  working capital levels  and capital expenditures 
with respect to identifiable intangibles  management also makes judgments and assumptions regarding useful lives 
management considers the following factors in evaluating events and circumstances for possible impairment i significant under performance relative to historical or projected operating results  ii negative industry trends  iii sales levels of specific groups of products related to specific identifiable intangibles  iv changes in overall business strategies  and v other factors 
if actual cash flows are less favorable than projections  this could trigger impairment of intangible assets and other long lived assets 
if impairment were to occur  this would negatively affect overall results of operations 
income taxes our provision for income taxes includes federal  foreign  state and local income taxes currently payable and those deferred because of temporary differences between income for financial reporting purposes and income for tax purposes 
we prepare estimates of permanent and temporary differences between income for financial reporting purposes and income for tax purposes 
these differences are adjusted to actual upon filing of our tax returns  typically occurring in the third and fourth quarters of the current fiscal year for the preceding fiscal year s estimates 

table of contents our deferred tax assets include net operating loss carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions 
the realization of tax benefits related to net operating loss carryforwards is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the applicable jurisdictions 
management assesses the level of deferred tax asset valuation allowance by taking into consideration historical and future projected operating results  future reversals of taxable temporary differences  as well as tax planning strategies 
the amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in future years if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
undistributed earnings in our non us subsidiaries are considered by management to be permanently re invested in such subsidiaries 
consequently  us deferred tax liabilities on such earnings have not been recorded 
we believe that such us taxes would be largely offset by foreign tax credits for taxes paid locally 
from time to time  our tax returns in federal  state and foreign jurisdictions are examined by the applicable tax authorities 
to the extent that adjustments result from the completion of these examinations or the lapsing of statutes of limitation  they will affect tax liabilities in the period known 
we believe that the results of any tax authority examinations would not have a significant adverse impact on financial condition or results of operations
