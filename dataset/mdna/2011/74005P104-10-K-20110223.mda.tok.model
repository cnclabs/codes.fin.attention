related party transactions the company s related parties are primarily unconsolidated equity affiliates 
the company did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated with independent parties 
environmental matters praxair s principal operations relate to the production and distribution of atmospheric and other industrial gases  which historically have not had a significant impact on the environment 
however  worldwide costs relating to environmental protection may continue to grow due to increasingly stringent laws and regulations  and praxair s ongoing commitment to rigorous internal standards 
climate change praxair operates in jurisdictions that have  or are developing  laws and or regulations to reduce or mitigate the perceived adverse effects of greenhouse gas ghg emissions and faces a highly uncertain regulatory environment in this area 
for example  the us environmental protection agency epa has promulgated rules requiring monitoring and controlling ghg emissions and one of these rules regulates ghg emissions from light duty vehicles and certain large manufacturing facilities  many of which are praxair suppliers or customers 
among other impacts  such regulations are expected to raise the costs of energy  which is a significant cost for praxair 
nevertheless  praxair s customer contracts routinely provide rights to recover increased electricity  natural gas  and other costs that are incurred by the company 
praxair anticipates continued growth in its hydrogen business  as hydrogen is essential to refineries which use it to remove sulfur from transportation fuels in order to meet ambient air quality standards in the united states 
hydrogen production plants and a large number of other manufacturing and electricity generating plants 
table of contents have been identified under california law as a source of carbon dioxide emissions and these plants have also become subject to recently promulgated cap and trade regulations in that state 
praxair believes it will be able to mitigate some potential costs through the terms of its product supply contracts  however  legislation that limits ghg emissions may impact growth in this area by increasing operating costs and or decreasing demand 
to manage these potential business risks from potential ghg emission regulation  praxair actively monitors current developments  evaluates the direct and indirect business risks  and takes appropriate actions 
among others  actions include increasing relevant resources and training  consulting with vendors  insurance providers and industry experts  incorporating ghg provisions in commercial agreements  and conducting regular reviews of the business risks with management 
although there are considerable uncertainties  praxair believes that the business risk from potential regulations can be effectively managed through its commercial contracts 
additionally  praxair does not anticipate any material effects regarding its plant operations or business arising from potential physical risks of climate change 
also  praxair continuously seeks opportunities to reduce its own energy use and ghg footprint 
at the same time  governmental regulation of ghg and other emissions and the growth of renewable energy alternatives may provide praxair with business opportunities 
praxair continues to develop new applications technologies that can lower emissions  including ghg emissions  in praxair s processes and help customers lower energy consumption and increase product throughout 
stricter regulation of water quality in emerging economies such as china provide a growing market for a number of gases  eg  oxygen for wastewater treatment 
renewable fuel standards in the european union and us create a market for second generation biofuels which are users of industrial gases such as oxygen  carbon dioxide  and hydrogen 
costs relating to the protection of the environment environmental protection costs in included approximately million in capital expenditures and million of expenses 
environmental protection expenditures decreased million during  primarily due to new projects coming on line 
praxair anticipates that future annual environmental protection expenditures will be similar to  subject to any significant changes in existing laws and regulations 
based on historical results and current estimates  management does not believe that environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position  the consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any given year

the funded status deficit for the international plans decreased by million at december  versus as the increase in plan assets was largely offset by an increase in the pbo from lower discount rates 

table of contents global pension contributions were million in  million in and million in estimates of contributions are in the range million to million 
the increase in pension contributions in and versus was primarily due to the decline in the value of pension assets as a result of the performance of the global securities markets and lower discount rates 
praxair assumes an expected return on plan assets for in the u 
s of 
in  consolidated pension expense is expected to be approximately million versus million in the increase is due primarily to an increase in the amortization of net actuarial gains losses 
the amortization is recognized based on the amount of net actuarial gains losses above certain thresholds and over the period of either the average remaining service lives or average remaining life expectancies of the employees or retirees 
opeb the net periodic benefit cost for postretirement benefits other than pensions opeb was million in and  and million in the funded status deficit decreased million during due primarily to a plan change in the us and benefit payments partially offset by the lower discount rates used in versus in  consolidated net periodic benefit costs for the opeb plans is expected to be approximately million compared to million in the decrease is primarily due to the favorable impact of a plan amendment within the us plans 
see the critical accounting policies section and note to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of the company s retirement benefits  including a description of the various retirement plans and the assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost and funded status 
insurance praxair purchases insurance to limit a variety of risks  including those related to property  business interruption  third party liability and workers compensation 
currently  the company self retains the first million per occurrence for workers compensation  general and vehicle liability and retains million to million per occurrence at its various properties worldwide 
to mitigate its aggregate loss potential above varying retentions  the company purchases insurance coverage from highly rated insurance companies at what it believes are reasonable coverage levels 
at december  and  the company had recorded a total of million and million  respectively  representing an estimate of the retained liability for the ultimate cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet dates 
the estimated liability is established using statistical analyses and is based upon historical experience  actuarial assumptions and professional judgment 
these estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency and are subject to a significant degree of inherent variability 
if actual claims differ from the company s estimates  they will be adjusted at that time and financial results could be impacted 
praxair recognizes estimated insurance proceeds relating to damages at the time of loss only to the extent of incurred losses 
any insurance recoveries for business interruption and for property damages in excess of the net book value of the property are recognized only when realized

see note to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures surrounding uncertain income tax positions 
off balance sheet arrangements as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  at december   praxair had entered into various guarantees and other arrangements  and had undrawn outstanding letters of credit from financial institutions 
these arrangements were entered into in connection with normal business operations and they are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on praxair s consolidated financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
critical accounting policies the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding praxair s financial statements and accompanying notes prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
their application places significant importance on management s judgment as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
praxair s financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected if actual results differ from estimates made 
these policies are determined by management and have been reviewed by praxair s audit committee 
depreciable lives of property  plant and equipment praxair s net property  plant and equipment at december  was  million  representing of the company s consolidated total assets 
depreciation expense for the year ended december  was million  or of total operating costs 
management judgment is required in the determination of the estimated depreciable lives that are used to calculate the annual depreciation expense and accumulated depreciation 
property  plant and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over the assets estimated useful lives on a straight line basis for financial reporting purposes 
the estimated useful life represents the projected period of time that the asset will be productively employed by the company and is determined by management based on many factors  including historical experience with similar assets  technological life cycles  geographic locations and contractual supply relationships with on site customers 
circumstances and events relating to these assets  such as on site contract modifications  are monitored to ensure that changes in asset lives or impairments see asset impairments are identified and prospective depreciation expense or impairment expense is adjusted accordingly 
praxair s largest asset values relate to cryogenic air separation production plants with depreciable lives of principally years 
based upon the assets as of december   if depreciable lives of machinery and equipment  on average  were increased or decreased by one year  annual depreciation expense would be decreased by approximately million or increased by approximately million  respectively 

table of contents pension benefits pension benefits represent financial obligations that will be ultimately settled in the future with employees who meet eligibility requirements 
because of the uncertainties involved in estimating the timing and amount of future payments  significant estimates are required to calculate pension expense and liabilities related to the company s plans 
the company utilizes the services of several independent actuaries  whose models are used to facilitate these calculations 
several key assumptions are used in actuarial models to calculate pension expense and liability amounts recorded in the financial statements 
management believes the three most significant variables in the models are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate  and the expected rate of compensation increase 
the actuarial models also use assumptions for various other factors  including employee turnover  retirement age  and mortality 
praxair management believes the assumptions used in the actuarial calculations are reasonable  reflect the company s experience and expectations for the future and are within accepted practices in each of the respective geographic locations in which it operates 
actual results in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors 
the weighted average expected long term rates of return on pension plan assets were for us plans and for international plans for the year ended december  and  respectively  at december  
these rates are determined annually by management based on a weighted average of current and historical market trends  historical and expected portfolio performance and the current and expected portfolio mix of investments 
a change in these expected long term rates of return  with all other variables held constant  would change praxair s pension expense by approximately million 
the company has consistently used a market related value of assets rather than the fair value at the measurement date to determine annual pension expense 
the market related value recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period 
as a result  changes in the fair value of assets from year to year are not immediately reflected in the company s annual pension expense 
instead  annual pension expense in future periods will be impacted as deferred investment gains or losses are recognized in the market related value of assets over the five year period 
the consolidated market related value of assets was  million  or million higher than the fair value of assets of  million at december  these net deferred investment losses of million will be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets ratably over the next four years and will impact future pension expense 
future actual investment gains or losses will impact the market related value of assets and  therefore  will impact future annual pension expense in a similar manner 
the weighted average discount rates for pension plan liabilities were for us plans and for international plans at december  and  respectively  at december  
these rates are used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities and are determined annually by management 
the discount rate for the us plan is established utilizing a bond matching model provided by the company s independent actuaries 
the portfolio of bonds includes only corporate bonds graded aa by moody s or standard poor s and matches the us plan s projected cash flows to the spot rates and calculates the single equivalent discount rate which produces the same present value 
the discount rates for the remaining international plans are based on market yields for high quality fixed income investments representing the approximate duration of the pension liabilities on the measurement date 
a increase decrease in discount rates  with all other variables held constant  would decrease increase praxair s pension expense by approximately million and would impact the projected benefit obligation pbo by approximately million 
the weighted average expected rate of compensation increase was for us plans and for international plans at december  and  respectively  at december  
the estimated annual compensation increase is determined by management every year and is based on historical trends and market indices 
a change in the expected rate of compensation increase  with all other variables held constant  would change praxair s pension expense by approximately million and would impact the pbo by approximately million 

table of contents asset impairments goodwill at december   the company had goodwill of  million  which represents the aggregate of the excess purchase price for acquired businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
the company performs a goodwill impairment test annually in the second quarter or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred  and no impairments were indicated 
the company has continuously re evaluated the likelihood of goodwill impairments in its reporting units subsequent to the second quarter test  and does not believe there is indication of impairment for any of its reporting units 
at december   praxair s enterprise value was approximately billion outstanding shares multiplied by the year end stock price plus debt  and without any control premium while its total capital was billion 
the impairment test requires that the company estimate and compare the fair value of its reporting units to their carrying value  including goodwill 
reporting units are determined based on one level below the operating segment level 
fair value is determined through the use of projected future cash flows  multiples of earnings and sales and other factors 
such analysis requires the use of certain future market assumptions and discount factors  which are subjective in nature 
estimated values can be affected by many factors beyond the company s control such as business and economic trends  government regulation  and technological changes 
management believes that the assumptions used to determine fair value are appropriate and reasonable 
although current calculations indicate that no reporting units are at risk of goodwill impairment  changes in circumstances or conditions affecting these assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value determination  which could then result in a material impairment charge to the company s results of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures concerning the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an individual asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
to assess recoverability  the company compares the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated from the asset or asset group to the carrying amount of the asset or asset group 
if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group  an impairment charge reducing the carrying amount to fair value is required 
fair value is determined based on the most appropriate valuation technique  including discounted cash flows 
this analysis requires management to make various subjective estimates and assumptions  including the amount of projected future cash flows related to the asset or asset group  the useful life over which cash flows will occur and the asset s residual value  if any 
income taxes at december   praxair had deferred tax assets of million net of valuation allowances of million  and deferred tax liabilities of  million 
at december   uncertain tax positions totaled million see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
income tax expense was million for the year ended december  in the preparation of consolidated financial statements  praxair estimates income taxes based on diverse legislative and regulatory structures that exist in various jurisdictions where the company conducts business 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent tax benefits or obligations that arise from temporary differences due to differing treatment of certain items for accounting and income tax purposes 
praxair evaluates 
table of contents deferred tax assets each period to ensure that estimated future taxable income will be sufficient in character eg capital gain versus ordinary income treatment  amount and timing to result in their recovery 
a valuation allowance is established when management determines that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized to reduce the assets to their realizable value 
considerable judgments are required in establishing deferred tax valuation allowances and in assessing exposures related to tax matters 
as events and circumstances change  related reserves and valuation allowances are adjusted to income at that time 
praxair s tax returns are subject to audit and local taxing authorities could challenge the company s tax positions 
the company s practice is to review tax filing positions by jurisdiction and to record provisions for uncertain income tax positions  including interest and penalties when applicable 
praxair believes it records and or discloses such potential tax liabilities as appropriate and has reasonably estimated its income tax liabilities and recoverable tax assets 
if new information becomes available  adjustments are charged against income at that time 
management does not anticipate that such adjustments would have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or liquidity  however  it is possible that the final outcomes could have a material impact on the company s reported results of operations 
contingencies the company accrues liabilities for non income tax contingencies when management believes that a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated  while contingent gains are recognized only when realized 
if new information becomes available or losses are sustained in excess of recorded amounts  adjustments are charged against income at that time 
management does not anticipate that in the aggregate such losses would have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or liquidity  however  it is possible that the final outcomes could have a material impact on the company s reported results of operations 
praxair is subject to various claims  legal proceedings and government investigations that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
these actions are based upon alleged environmental  tax  antitrust and personal injury claims  among others see note to the consolidated financial statements 
such contingencies are significant and the accounting requires considerable management judgments in analyzing each matter to assess the likely outcome and the need for establishing appropriate liabilities and providing adequate disclosures 
praxair believes it records and or discloses such potential contingencies as appropriate and has reasonably estimated its liabilities 
new accounting standards see note to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning new accounting standards and the impact of the implementation of these standards on the company s financial statements 
fair value measurements praxair does not expect changes in the aggregate fair value of its financial assets and liabilities to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk praxair is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
the objective of financial risk management at praxair is to minimize the negative impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the company s earnings  cash flows and equity 
to manage these risks  praxair uses various derivative financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  currency swaps  forward contracts  currency options and commodity contracts 
praxair only uses commonly traded and non leveraged instruments 
these contracts are entered into primarily with major banking institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
also  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of praxair s accounting policies and use of such instruments 
the following discussion presents the sensitivity of the market value  earnings and cash flows of praxair s financial instruments to hypothetical changes in interest and exchange rates assuming these changes occurred at december  the range of changes chosen for these discussions reflects praxair s view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one year period 
market values represent the present values of projected future cash flows based on interest rate and exchange rate assumptions 
interest rate and debt sensitivity analysis at december   praxair had debt totaling  million  million at december  
at december   there were two interest rate swap agreements outstanding with notional amounts totaling million that convert fixed rate interest to variable rate interest on the million notes due and the million notes that mature in at december   there was one interest rate swap agreement outstanding that converts fixed rate interest to variable rate interest on the million notes that mature in when considered necessary  interest rate swaps are entered into as hedges of underlying financial instruments to effectively change the characteristics of the interest rate without actually changing the underlying financial instrument 
for fixed rate instruments  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate instruments  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
at december   praxair had fixed rate debt of  million and floating rate debt of  million  representing and  respectively  of total debt 
at december   praxair had fixed rate debt of  million and floating rate debt of  million  representing and  respectively  of total debt 
holding other variables constant such as foreign exchange rates  swaps and debt levels  a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would increase the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately million million in 
at december  and  the after tax earnings and cash flows impact for the subsequent year resulting from a one percentage point increase in interest rates would be approximately million and million  respectively  holding other variables constant 
exchange rate sensitivity analysis praxair s exchange rate exposures result primarily from its investments and ongoing operations in south america primarily brazil  argentina  colombia and venezuela  europe primarily italy  spain and germany  canada  mexico  asia primarily china  india  korea and thailand and other business transactions such as the procurement of equipment from foreign sources 
among other techniques  praxair utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts and options to hedge these exposures 
at december   praxair had  million notional amount  million at december  of foreign exchange contracts of which  million  million in were to hedge recorded balance sheet exposures and million million in were to hedge anticipated future net income 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
holding other variables constant  if there were a adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates for the portfolio  the fair market value of foreign currency contracts outstanding at december  and would decrease by approximately million and million  respectively  which would be largely offset by an offsetting gain or loss on the foreign currency fluctuation of the underlying exposure being hedged
