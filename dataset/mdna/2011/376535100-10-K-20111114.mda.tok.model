item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this form k 
except per share amounts  dollar amounts are in thousands unless otherwise indicated 
overview general we were incorporated under the general corporation laws of the state of maryland on may  our investment objective is to achieve a high level of current income by investing in debt securities  consisting primarily of senior notes  senior subordinated notes and junior subordinated notes  of established private businesses in the united states that are substantially owned by leveraged buyout funds  individual investors or are family owned businesses  with a particular focus on senior notes 
in addition  we may acquire from other funds existing loans that meet this profile 
we also seek to provide our stockholders with long term capital growth through the appreciation in the value of warrants or other equity instruments that we may receive when we make loans 
we operate as a closed end  non diversified management investment company  and have elected to be treated as a bdc under the investment company act of  as amended the act 
in addition  for tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a ric under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
we seek to invest in small and medium sized private us businesses that meet certain criteria  including some but not all of the following the potential for growth in cash flow  adequate assets for loan collateral  experienced management teams with a significant ownership interest in the borrower  profitable operations based on the borrower s cash flow  reasonable capitalization of the borrower usually by leveraged buyout funds or venture capital funds and the potential to realize appreciation and gain liquidity in our equity position  if any 
we anticipate that liquidity in our equity position will be achieved through a merger or acquisition of the borrower  a public offering of the borrower s stock or by exercising our right to require the borrower to repurchase our warrants  though there can be no assurance that we will always have these rights 
we lend to borrowers that need funds to finance growth  restructure their balance sheets or effect a change of control 
we invest either by ourselves or jointly with other funds and or management of the portfolio company  depending on the opportunity 
if we are participating in an investment with one or more co investors  our investment is likely to be smaller than if we were investing alone 
business environment while economic conditions generally appear to be improving  we remain cautious about a long term economic recovery 
the recent recession in general  and the disruptions in the capital markets in particular  have impacted our liquidity options and increased the cost of debt and equity capital 
many of the companies in which we have made investments  as well as those that we evaluate for investment  are impacted by these economic conditions  and if these conditions persist  it may affect their ability to repay our loans or engage in a liquidity event  such as a sale  recapitalization or initial public offering 
the economic conditions could also disproportionately impact some of the industries in which we have invested  causing us to be more vulnerable to losses in our portfolio  which could cause the number of our non performing assets to increase and the fair market value of our portfolio to decrease 
we do not know when market conditions will continue to improve again or if adverse conditions will again intensify  and we do not know the full extent to which the economic downturn will affect us 
if market instability persists or intensifies  we may experience difficulty in raising capital 
market conditions have affected the trading price of our common stock and our ability to finance new investments through the issuance of equity 
on november   the closing market price of our common stock was  a discount to our september  nav per share of 
when our stock trades below nav  as it has periodically traded for more than three years  our ability to issue equity is constrained by provisions of the act  which generally prohibits the issuance and sale of our common stock below nav per share without stockholder approval other than through sales to our then existing stockholders pursuant to a rights offering 
at our annual meeting of stockholders held on february   stockholders approved a proposal which authorizes us to sell shares of our common stock at a price below our then current nav per share subject to certain limitations including  but not limited to  that the cumulative number of shares issued and sold pursuant to such authority does not exceed of our then outstanding common stock immediately prior to each such sale for a period of one year from the date of approval  provided that our board of directors makes certain 
table of contents determinations prior to any such sale 
at the upcoming annual stockholders meeting scheduled for february   our stockholders will again be asked to vote in favor of renewing this proposal for another year 
challenges in the current market are intensified for us by certain regulatory limitations under the code and the act  as well as contractual restrictions under the agreement governing the credit facility that further constrain our ability to access the capital markets 
to maintain our qualification as a ric  we must satisfy  among other requirements  an annual distribution requirement to pay out at least of our ordinary income and short term capital gains to our stockholders 
because we are required to distribute our income in this manner  and because the illiquidity of many of our investments makes it difficult for us to finance new investments through the sale of current investments  our ability to make new investments is highly dependent upon external financing 
our external financing sources include the issuance of equity securities  debt securities or other leverage such as borrowings under our line of credit 
our ability to seek external debt financing  to the extent that it is available under current market conditions  is further subject to the asset coverage limitations of the act  which require us to have at least a asset coverage ratio  meaning generally that for every dollar of debt  we must have two dollars of assets 
the unstable economic conditions may also continue to decrease the value of collateral securing some of our loans  as well as the value of our equity investments  which has impacted and may continue to impact our ability to borrow under the credit facility 
additionally  the credit facility contains covenants regarding the maintenance of certain minimum net worth requirements  which are affected by the decrease in value of our portfolio 
failure to meet these requirements would result in a default which  if we are unable to obtain a waiver from our lenders  would result in the acceleration of our repayment obligations under the credit facility 
as of september   we were in compliance with all of the credit facility covenants 
we expect that  given these regulatory and contractual constraints in combination with current market conditions  debt and equity capital may be costly or difficult for us to access in the near term 
however  we believe that our recent public offering of term preferred stock discussed in detail further below in equity activity increases our ability to make conservative investments in businesses that we believe will weather the current economic conditions and will be likely to produce attractive long term returns for our stockholders 
investment highlights during the fiscal year ended september   we extended million in new debt and equity investments to new portfolio companies  and we extended million of investments to existing portfolio companies through revolver draws or additions to term notes 
also  during the fiscal year ended september   we exited five portfolio companies for aggregate proceeds of approximately million  and we received scheduled and unscheduled contractual principal repayments of approximately million from existing portfolio companies 
since our initial public offering in august  we have made different loans to  or investments in  companies for a total of approximately billion  before giving effect to principal repayments on investments and divestitures 
investment activity during the fiscal year ended september   we executed the following transactions with certain of our portfolio companies purchases during the year ended september   we extended million of senior term or senior subordinated syndicated loan investments to new portfolio companies and million of investments to two new proprietary portfolio companies north american aircraft services llc and westland technologies  inc 
in monitoring the market activity during the year ended september   we noted favorable syndicate loan marketplace conditions and consequently increased our investment in such loans 
the majority of our senior syndicated loan investments occurred during the quarters ended march and june  
table of contents repayments and exits during the year ended september   borrowers made principal repayments totaling million in the aggregate  consisting of million in unscheduled payoffs as well as million in contractual amortization  revolver repayments and principal payments 
included in the principal payments were payoffs of four portfolio companies at par  interfilm holdings  inc  puerto rico cable acquisition company  inc  pinnacle treatment centers  inc and airvana network solutions  inc 
additionally  we sold one portfolio company  finn corporation  for in net proceeds 
workouts in january  we purchased common stock for million from existing shareholders of sunshine media holdings sunshine media  a publisher of regional bb trade magazines  which gave us a controlling interest in the company and resulted in the reclassification of the investment from non control non affiliate to control during the quarter ended march  additionally  we have extended million to sunshine media through revolver draws since january in july  we increased our investment in viapack  inc viapack  a manufacturer of polyethylene film  by adding a line of credit facility and purchasing preferred equity  which gave us a controlling interest in the company and resulted in the reclassification of the investment from non control non affiliate to control during the quarter ended september  the facility had million drawn as of september  in august  we restructured our loan to sci cable  inc sci  a cable  internet and voice services provider  through a ucc article sale 
this resulted in a new control entity  kansas cable holdings  inc  obtaining certain of the assets of sci and we recognized a realized loss of million during the quarter ended september  kansas cable holdings  inc replaced sci on the schedule of investments and remains on non accrual status as of september  refer to note  subsequent events in the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for investment activity occurring subsequent to september  equity activity term preferred stock offering on november   we completed an offering of million shares of series term preferred stock  par value per share term preferred stock  at a public offering price of per share under a shelf registration statement on form n file no 
 and pursuant to a prospectus dated july   as supplemented by a final prospectus supplement dated october   which was filed with the sec on october  net proceeds of the offering  after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses borne by us were approximately million and were used to repay a portion of outstanding borrowings under our line of credit 
in connection with the offering  we also granted the underwriters an option  exercisable on or before november   to purchase an additional  shares of term preferred stock from us on the same terms solely to cover over allotments  if any 
on november   the underwriters notified us of their intent to exercise their option to purchase an additional  shares of our term preferred stock 
refer to note  subsequent events in the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for discussion of the term preferred stock offering 
investment strategy our strategy is to make loans at favorable interest rates to small and medium sized us businesses 
our loans typically range from million to million  although this investment size may vary proportionately as the size of our capital base changes  generally mature in no more than seven years and accrue interest at variable rates and to a lesser extent fixed rates 
because the majority of our portfolio loans consist of term debt of private companies that typically cannot or will not expend the resources to have their debt securities rated by a credit rating agency  we expect that most  if not all  of the debt securities we acquire will be unrated 
accordingly  we cannot accurately predict what ratings these loans might receive if they were rated  and thus cannot determine whether or not they could be considered investment grade quality 

table of contents to the extent possible  our loans generally are collateralized by a security interest in the borrower s assets 
interest payments are generally made monthly or quarterly with amortization of principal generally being deferred for several years 
the principal amount of the loans and any accrued but unpaid interest generally become due in no more than seven years 
original issue discount oid arises when we extend a loan and receive an equity interest in the borrower at the same time  or purchase a loan at a discount to par 
to the extent that the price paid for the equity is not at market value  we must allocate part of the price paid for the loan  to the value of the equity 
then the amount allocated to the equity  the oid  must be amortized over the life of the loan 
the amortization of oid also produces income that must be recognized for purposes of satisfying the distribution requirements for a ric under subchapter m of the code  whereas the cash is received  if at all  when the equity instrument is sold 
as of september   we had loans with oid income  as compared to four oid loans as of september  we increased the number of syndicated loan investments in our portfolio during  which generally have an oid component 
we recorded oid income of million for the year ended september   as compared to for the year ended september  the unamortized balance of oid investments as of september  and totaled million and million  respectively 
some of our loans may contain a provision that calls for some portion of the interest payments to be deferred and added to the principal balance so that the interest is paid  together with the principal  at maturity 
this form of deferred interest is often called paid in kind pik interest and  when earned  we record pik interest as interest income and add the pik interest to the principal balance of the loans 
we seek to avoid pik interest with all potential investments under review 
during the quarter ended june   our sole pik investment was restructured and the pik interest component was eliminated  therefore as of september   we had no investments that bore pik interest  as compared to one investments with pik interest as of september  in addition  as a bdc under the act  we are required to make available significant managerial assistance to our portfolio companies 
our investment adviser  gladstone management corporation the adviser provides these services on our behalf through its officers who are also our officers 
currently  neither we nor our adviser charges a fee for managerial assistance  however  if our adviser does receive fees for managerial assistance  our adviser will credit the managerial assistance fees to the base management fee due from us to our adviser 
our adviser and gladstone securities  llp gladstone securities a broker dealer registered with the finra  each an affiliate of ours  receive fees for certain services they separately provide to certain of our portfolio companies 
such fees are generally paid directly to our adviser or gladstone securities  as applicable 
when our adviser receives such fees  of certain of those fees and of others are credited against the base management fee that we pay to our adviser 
gladstone securities provides certain of our portfolio companies with investment banking and due diligence services  these fees do not impact the overall fees that we pay the adviser 
our adviser also receives fees for monitoring and reviewing portfolio company investments 
these fees are recurring and are generally paid annually or quarterly in advance to our adviser throughout the life of the investment 
fees of this nature are recorded as revenue by our adviser when earned and are not credited against the base management fee 
we may receive fees for the origination and closing services we provide to portfolio companies through our adviser 
these fees are paid directly to us and are recognized as other income upon closing of the originated investment 
prior to making an investment  we ordinarily enter into a non binding term sheet with the potential borrower 
these non binding term sheets are generally subject to a number of conditions  including  but not limited to  the satisfactory completion of our due diligence investigations of the potential borrower s business  reaching agreement on the legal documentation for the loan  and the receipt of all necessary consents 
upon execution of the non binding term sheet  the potential borrower generally pays the adviser a non refundable fee for services rendered by the adviser through the date of the non binding term sheet 
these fees are received by the adviser and are offset against the base management fee payable to the adviser  which has the effect of reducing our expenses to the extent of any such fees received by the adviser 
in the event that we expend significant effort in considering and negotiating a potential investment that ultimately is not consummated  we generally will seek reimbursement from the proposed borrower for our reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the transaction  including legal fees 
any amounts collected for expenses incurred by the adviser in connection with unconsummated investments will be reimbursed to the adviser 
amounts collected for these expenses incurred by us will be reimbursed to us and will be recognized in the period in which such reimbursement is received  however  there can be no guarantee that we will be successful in collecting any such reimbursements

the second part of the incentive fee is a capital gains based incentive fee that is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each fiscal year or upon termination of the advisory agreement  as of the termination date  and equals of our realized capital gains as of the end of the fiscal year 
in determining the capital gains based incentive fee payable to our adviser  we will calculate the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains and cumulative aggregate realized capital losses since our inception  and the aggregate unrealized capital depreciation as of the date of the calculation  as applicable  with respect to each of the investments in our portfolio 
the adviser has not earned the capital gains based portion of the incentive fee since our inception 
we pay our direct expenses including  but not limited to  directors fees  legal and accounting fees  stockholder related expenses  and directors and officers insurance under the advisory agreement

as of september   six investments were on non accrual  for an aggregate of approximately million at cost  or of the aggregate cost of our investment portfolio 

table of contents the weighted average yield varies from year to year based on the current stated interest rate of interest bearing investments 
the weighted average yield was for the year ended september  as compared to for the prior year 
the increase in the weighted average yield on our portfolio for the year ended september  resulted primarily from the repayment of loans with lower stated interest rates and the restructuring of certain loans into higher interest rate loans  partially offset by the purchase of syndicated loans  which generally bear lower interest rates than our existing proprietary debt investments 
interest income from loans to certain employees of our adviser  in connection with the exercise of employee stock options  decreased slightly  primarily as a result of significant repayments on the principal amounts in these decreases were offset almost entirely by increases in the interest rates on the loans due to the fact that certain significant loans were in default  triggering penalty interest provisions for all of fiscal other income decreased for the year ended september  as compared to the prior year  mainly due to decreases in success fees  which we recognize when payment is received 
success fees earned during the year ended september  totaled million  which we received primarily from interfilm holdings  inc and pinnacle treatment centers  inc for actual exits in  and also from westlake hardware  inc as a prepaid success fee

table of contents operating expenses operating expenses  net of credits from the adviser for fees earned and voluntary irrevocable and unconditional waivers to the base management and incentive fees  decreased for the year ended september  as compared to the prior year 
this reduction was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees incurred in connection with the credit facility  which were partially offset by an increase in professional fees 
loan servicing fees decreased for the year ended september  as compared to the prior year 
these fees were incurred in connection with a loan servicing agreement between business loan and our adviser  which is based on the size and mix of the portfolio 
the decrease was primarily due to the reduction in the size of our investment portfolio 
the base management fee which is net of loan servicing fees increased for the year ended september  as compared to the prior year 
however  the gross management fee consisting of the loan servicing fees plus the base management fee decreased from the prior year

table of contents previously defined  resulting in increased amortization of deferred financing fees during the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  compensation expense increased for the year ended september  as compared to the prior year due to the conversion of stock option loans of two former employees from recourse to non recourse loans 
the conversions were non cash transactions and were accounted for as repurchases of the shares previously received by the employees upon exercise of the stock options in exchange for the non recourse notes 
the repurchases were accounted for as treasury stock transactions at the fair value of the shares  totaling million

distributions in order to qualify as a ric and to avoid corporate level tax on the income we distribute to our stockholders  we are required  under subchapter m of the code  to distribute at least of our ordinary income and short term capital gains to our stockholders on an annual basis 
in accordance with these requirements  we declared and paid monthly cash distributions of per common share for each month during the years ended september  and from october through march and from april through september  we declared and paid monthly cash distributions of and per common share  respectively 
for the year ended september   our distribution payments were approximately million 
we declared these distributions based on our estimates of net investment income for the fiscal year 
section a disclosure our board of directors estimates the source of the distributions at the time of their declaration as required by section a of the act 
on a monthly basis  if required under section a  we post a section a notice through the depository trust company s legal notice system lens and also send to our registered stockholders a written section a notice along with the payment of distributions for any payment which includes a distribution estimated to be paid from any other source other than net investment income 
the estimates of the source of the distribution are interim estimates based on us gaap that are subject to revision  and the exact character of the distributions for tax purposes cannot be determined until the final books and records are finalized for the calendar year 
following the calendar year end  after definitive information has been determined by us  if we have made distributions of taxable income or return of capital  we will deliver a form div to our stockholders specifying such amount and the tax characterization of such amount 
therefore  these estimates are made solely in order to comply with the requirements of section a of the act and should not be relied upon for tax reporting or any other purposes and could differ significantly from the actual character of distributions for tax purposes 
equity on october   we filed a registration statement the registration statement on form n file no 
that was amended on december  and which the sec declared effective on january  post effective 
table of contents amendments to such registration statement were filed and it was declared effective by the sec on july  the registration statement permits us to issue  through one or more transactions  up to an aggregate of million in securities  consisting of common stock  preferred stock  subscription rights  debt securities and warrants to purchase common stock  including through a combined offering of such securities 
to date  under the registration statement  we have issued million in term preferred stock pursuant to the registration statement  have granted the underwriters an option to purchase another million of term preferred stock  and have entered into an agreement described in greater detail below  to potentially issue up to million shares of common stock from time to time in the future 
on november   we completed an offering of million shares of term preferred stock at a price of per share pursuant to the registration statement 
net proceeds of the offering  after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses borne by us were approximately million and were used to repay a portion of outstanding borrowings under our line of credit 
we are required to redeem all of the outstanding term preferred stock on december  at a redemption price equal to per share plus an amount equal to accumulated but unpaid dividends  if any  to the date of redemption 
the term preferred stock will be recorded as a liability in accordance with gaap and as such will affect our asset coverage  exposing us to additional leverage risks 
no preferred stock had been issued as of september  on may   the company and the adviser entered into an equity distribution agreement the agreement with bb t capital markets  a division of scott stringfellow  llc the agent  under which we may  from time to time  issue and sell through the agent  as sales agent  up to million shares the shares of our common stock  par value per share  based upon instructions from the company including  at a minimum  the number of shares to be offered  the time period during which sales are requested to be made  any limitation on the number of shares that may be sold in any one day and any minimum price below which sales may not be made 
sales of shares through the agent  if any  will be executed by means of either ordinary brokers transactions on the nasdaq global select market in accordance with rule under the securities act of  as amended  or such other sales of the shares as shall be agreed by the company and the agent 
the compensation payable to the agent for sales of shares with respect to which the agent acts as sales agent shall be equal to of the gross sales price of the shares for amounts of shares sold pursuant to the agreement 
to date  we have not issued any shares pursuant to this agreement 
we anticipate issuing equity securities to obtain additional capital in the future 
however  we cannot determine the terms of any future equity issuances or whether we will be able to issue equity on terms favorable to us  or at all 
additionally  when our common stock is trading below nav  as it has consistently traded for most of the last months  we will have regulatory constraints under the act on our ability to obtain additional capital in this manner 
generally  the act provides that we may not issue and sell our common stock at a price below our nav per share  other than to our then existing stockholders pursuant to a rights offering  without first obtaining approval from our stockholders and our independent directors 
as of september   our nav per share was and as of november  our closing market price was per share 
to the extent that our common stock trades at a market price below our nav per share  we will generally be precluded from raising equity capital through public offerings of our common stock  other than pursuant to stockholder approval or a rights offering 
the asset coverage requirement of a bdc under the act effectively limits our ratio of debt to equity to to the extent that we are unable to raise capital through the issuance of equity  our ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt may also be inhibited to the extent of our regulatory debt to equity ratio limits 
at our annual meeting of stockholders held on february   our stockholders approved a proposal that authorizes us to sell shares of our common stock at a price below our then current nav per share for a period of one year  provided that our board of directors makes certain determinations prior to any such sale 
we have not issued any common stock since february at the upcoming annual stockholders meeting scheduled for february   our stockholders will again be asked to vote in favor of renewing this proposal for another year 
revolving credit facility on march   we  through business loan  entered into a fourth amended and restated credit agreement  which provides for a million revolving line of credit arranged by key equipment finance inc keybank as administrative agent 
branch banking and trust company bb t and ing capital llc ing also joined the credit facility as committed lenders 
subject to certain terms and conditions  the credit facility may be expanded to a total of million through the addition of other committed lenders to the facility 
on november  the amendment date  we amended the credit facility 
prior to the amendment date  advances under the credit facility bore interest at a day libor subject to a minimum rate of  plus per annum  with a commitment fee of per annum on undrawn amounts 
as of the amendment date  advances under the credit facility bear interest at a day libor or commercial paper rate subject to a 
table of contents minimum rate of  plus per annum  with a commitment fee of per annum on undrawn amounts when the facility is drawn more than and per annum on undrawn amounts when the facility is drawn less than 
in addition  effective as of the amendment date  we are no longer obligated to pay an annual minimum earnings shortfall fee to the committed lenders  which was calculated as the difference between the weighted average of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and of the commitment amount of the credit facility  multiplied by per annum  less commitment fees paid during the year 
during the quarter ended december   we reversed the projected annual minimum earnings shortfall fee of million that had been accrued as of september  we paid a million fee in connection with the november amendment 
in august  the credit facility was expanded by million  which resulted in a million line of credit 
all other terms of the existing line of credit remained the same 
the credit facility matures on march   and  if the facility is not renewed or extended by this date  all unpaid principal and interest will be due and payable on march  in addition  if the credit facility is not renewed on or before march   we will be required to use all principal collections from our loans to pay outstanding principal on the credit facility 
interest is payable monthly during the term of the credit facility 
available borrowings are subject to various constraints imposed under the credit facility  based on the aggregate loan balance pledged by business loan  which varies as loans are added and repaid  regardless of whether such repayments are prepayments or made as contractually required 
the administrative agent also requires that any interest or principal payments on pledged loans be remitted directly by the borrower into a lockbox account with keybank as custodian 
keybank  who also serves as the trustee of the account  generally remits the collected funds to us once a month 
the credit facility contains covenants that require business loan to maintain its status as a separate legal entity  prohibit certain significant corporate transactions such as mergers  consolidations  liquidations or dissolutions  and restrict material changes to our credit and collection policies 
the credit facility also limits payments on distributions to the aggregate net investment income for each of the twelve month periods ended september  and business loan is also subject to certain limitations on the type of loan investments it can apply toward availability credit in the borrowing base  including restrictions on geographic concentrations  sector concentrations  loan size  dividend payout  payment frequency and status  average life and lien property 
the credit facility further requires business loan to comply with other financial and operational covenants  which obligate business loan to  among other things  maintain certain financial ratios  including asset and interest coverage and a minimum number of obligors required in the borrowing base of the credit agreement 
additionally  we are subject to a performance guaranty that requires us to maintain i a minimum net of million plus of all equity and subordinated debt raised after may   ii asset coverage with respect to senior securities representing indebtedness of at least  in accordance with section of the act and iii its status as a bdc under the act and as a ric under the code 
the facility requires a minimum of obligors in the borrowing base and as of september   business loan had obligors 
as of september   we were in compliance with all of the facility covenants contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements at september   we were not party to any signed commitments for potential investments 
however  we have lines of credit and capital commitments with certain of our portfolio companies that have not been fully drawn or called  respectively 
since these commitments have expiration dates and we expects many will never be fully drawn or called  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we estimate the fair value of these unused and uncalled commitments as of september  and to be minimal 
in addition to the lines of credit and capital commitments with our portfolio companies  we  from time to time  have also extended certain guaranties on behalf of some our portfolio companies 
as of september   there were no outstanding guaranties 
as described above  in november  we completed the offering of million shares of term preferred stock 
the term preferred stock provides for a fixed dividend equal to per year  payable monthly which equates to approximately million per year 
additionally  in accordance with the terms of the term preferred stock  we will be obligated to redeem these shares for cash on december  and  in certain circumstances  potentially earlier 
the aggregate 
table of contents redemption amount will be million  plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends through the redemption date 
additionally  until november   the underwriters for the offering have an option to purchase an additional  shares of term preferred stock to cover over allotments  if any 
on november   the underwriters notified us of their intent to exercise their option to purchase an additional  shares of our term preferred stock 
if this option is exercised in full  our annual dividend obligations on the term preferred stock would increase to approximately million and the aggregate redemption amount of the term preferred stock  exclusive of any accumulated and unpaid dividends  would increase to million 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported consolidated amounts of assets and liabilities  including disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and revenues and expenses during the period reported 
actual results could materially differ from those estimates 
we have identified our investment valuation process  as our most critical accounting policy 
investment valuation the most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments recorded 
general valuation policy we value our investments in accordance with the requirements of the act 
as discussed more fully below  we value securities for which market quotations are readily available and reliable at their market value 
we value all other securities and assets at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors 
asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
asc provides a consistent definition of fair value that focuses on exit price in the principal  or most advantageous  market and prioritizes  within a measurement of fair value  the use of market based inputs over entity specific inputs 
asc also establishes the following three level hierarchy for fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date 
level inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets  level inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
level inputs are in those markets for which there are few transactions  the prices are not current  little public information exists or instances where prices vary substantially over time or among brokered market makers  and level inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement 
unobservable inputs are those inputs that reflect our own assumptions that market participants would use to price the asset or liability based upon the best available information 
see note  investments in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding fair value measurements and our adoption of asc we use generally accepted valuation techniques to value our portfolio unless we have specific information about the value of an investment to determine otherwise 
from time to time we may accept an appraisal of a business in which we hold securities 
these appraisals are expensive and occur infrequently but provide a third party valuation opinion that may differ in results  techniques and scopes used to value our investments 
when these specific third party appraisals are engaged or accepted  we would use estimates of value provided by such appraisals and our own assumptions including estimated remaining life  current market yield and interest rate spreads of similar securities  as of the measurement date  to value the investment we have in that business 
in determining the value of our investments  our adviser has established an investment valuation policy the policy 
the policy has been approved by our board of directors  and each quarter our board of directors reviews whether our adviser has applied the policy consistently and votes whether or not to accept the recommended valuation of our investment portfolio 

table of contents the policy  which is summarized below  applies to the following categories of securities publicly traded securities  securities for which a limited market exists  and securities for which no market exists 
valuation methods publicly traded securities we determine the value of publicly traded securities based on the closing price for the security on the exchange or securities market on which it is listed and primarily traded on the valuation date 
to the extent that we own restricted securities that are not freely tradable  but for which a public market otherwise exists  we will use the market value of that security adjusted for any decrease in value resulting from the restrictive feature 
securities for which a limited market exists we value securities that are not traded on an established secondary securities market  but for which a limited market for the security exists  such as certain participations in  or assignments of  syndicated loans  at the quoted bid price 
in valuing these assets  we assess trading activity in an asset class  evaluate variances in prices and other market insights to determine if any available quote prices are reliable 
if we conclude that quotes based on active markets or trading activity may be relied upon  firm bid prices are requested  however  if a firm bid price is unavailable  we base the value of the security upon the ibp offered by the respective originating syndication agent s trading desk  or secondary desk  on or near the valuation date 
to the extent that we use the ibp as a basis for valuing the security  our adviser may take further steps to consider additional information to validate that price in accordance with the policy 
in the event these limited markets become illiquid such that market prices are no longer readily available  we will value our syndicated loans using alternative methods  such as estimated net present values of the future cash flows or dcf 
the use of a dcf methodology follows that prescribed by asc  which provides guidance on the use of a reporting entity s own assumptions about future cash flows and risk adjusted discount rates when relevant observable inputs  such as quotes in active markets  are not available 
when relevant observable market data does not exist  the alternative outlined in asc is the valuation of investments based on dcf 
for the purposes of using dcf to provide fair value estimates  we consider multiple inputs such as a risk adjusted discount rate that incorporates adjustments that market participants would make both for nonperformance and liquidity risks 
as such  we develop a modified discount rate approach that incorporates risk premiums including  among others  increased probability of default  or higher loss given default  or increased liquidity risk 
the dcf valuations applied to the syndicated loans provide an estimate of what we believe a market participant would pay to purchase a syndicated loan in an active market  thereby establishing a fair value 
we apply the dcf methodology in illiquid markets until quoted prices are available or are deemed reliable based on trading activity 
as of september   we believe that the indicative bid prices are reliable indicators of fair value 
however  because of the private nature of this marketplace meaning actual transactions are not publicly reported  we believe that these valuation inputs are classified as level within the fair value hierarchy as defined in asc securities for which no market exists the valuation methodology for securities for which no market exists falls into four categories portfolio investments comprised solely of debt securities  portfolio investments in controlled companies comprised of a bundle of securities  which can include debt and equity securities  portfolio investments in non controlled companies comprised of a bundle of investments  which can include debt and equity securities  and portfolio investments comprised of non publicly traded non control equity securities of other funds 
portfolio investments comprised solely of debt securities debt securities that are not publicly traded on an established securities market  or for which a limited market does not exist non public debt securities  and that are issued by portfolio companies where we have no equity or equity like securities  are fair valued in accordance with the terms of the policy  which utilizes opinions of value submitted to us by spse 
we may also submit pik interest to spse for their evaluation when it is determined that pik interest is likely to be received 
in the case of non public debt securities  we have engaged spse to submit opinions of value for our debt securities that are issued by portfolio companies in which we own no equity  or equity like securities 
spse s opinions of value are based on the valuations prepared by our portfolio management team as described below 
we request that spse also evaluate and assign values to success fees conditional interest included in some loan securities when we determine that there is reasonable probability of receiving a success fee on a given loan 
spse will only evaluate the debt portion of our investments for which we specifically request evaluation  and may decline to make requested evaluations for any reason at its sole discretion 
upon completing our collection of data with respect to the investments which may include the 
table of contents information described below under credit information  the risk ratings of the loans described below under loan grading and risk rating and the factors described hereunder  this valuation data is forwarded to spse for review and analysis 
spse makes its independent assessment of the data that we have assembled and assesses its independent data to form an opinion as to what they consider to be the market values for the securities 
with regard to its work  spse has issued the following paragraph spse provides evaluated price opinions which are reflective of what spse believes the bid side of the market would be for each loan after careful review and analysis of descriptive  market and credit information 
each price reflects spse s best judgment based upon careful examination of a variety of market factors 
because of fluctuation in the market and in other factors beyond its control  spse cannot guarantee these evaluations 
the evaluations reflect the market prices  or estimates thereof  on the date specified 
the prices are based on comparable market prices for similar securities 
market information has been obtained from reputable secondary market sources 
although these sources are considered reliable  spse cannot guarantee their accuracy 
spse opinions of value of our debt securities that are issued by portfolio companies where we have no equity or equity like securities are submitted to our board of directors along with our adviser s supplemental assessment and recommendation regarding valuation of each of these investments 
our adviser generally accepts the opinion of value given by spse  however  in certain limited circumstances  such as when our adviser may learn new information regarding an investment between the time of submission to spse and the date of the board assessment our adviser s conclusions as to value may differ from the opinion of value delivered by spse 
our board of directors then reviews whether our adviser has followed its established procedures for determinations of fair value  and votes to accept or reject the recommended valuation of our investment portfolio 
our adviser and our management recommended  and the board of directors voted to accept  the opinions of value delivered by spse on the loans in our portfolio as denoted on the consolidated schedule of investments included in our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
because there is a delay between when we close an investment and when the investment can be evaluated by spse  new loans are not valued immediately by spse  rather  management makes its own determination about the value of these investments in accordance with our valuation policy using the methods described herein 
portfolio investments in controlled companies comprised of a bundle of investments  which can include debt and equity securities the fair value of these investments is determined based on the total enterprise value of the portfolio company  or issuer  utilizing a liquidity waterfall approach 
for non public debt securities and equity or equity like securities eg preferred equity  common equity  or other equity like securities that are purchased together as part of a package  where we have control or could gain control through an option or warrant security  both the debt and equity securities of the portfolio investment would exit in the mergers and acquisitions market as the principal market  generally through a sale or recapitalization of the portfolio company 
in accordance with asc  we apply the in use premise of value which assumes the debt and equity securities are sold together 
under this liquidity waterfall approach  we continue to use the enterprise value methodology utilizing a liquidity waterfall approach to determine the fair value of these investments under asc if we have the ability to initiate a sale of a portfolio company as of the measurement date 
under this approach  we first calculate the total enterprise value of the issuer by incorporating some or all of the following factors the issuer s ability to make payments  the earnings of the issuer  recent sales to third parties of similar securities  the comparison to publicly traded securities  and dcf or other pertinent factors 
in gathering the sales to third parties of similar securities  we may reference industry statistics and use outside experts 
once we have estimated the total enterprise value of the issuer  we subtract the value of all the debt securities of the issuer  which are valued at the contractual principal balance 
fair values of these debt securities are discounted for any shortfall of total enterprise value over the total debt outstanding for the issuer 
once the values for all outstanding senior securities which include the debt securities have been subtracted from the total enterprise value of the issuer  the remaining amount  if any  is used to determine the value of the issuer s equity or equity like securities 
if  in our adviser s judgment  the liquidity waterfall approach does not accurately reflect the value of the debt component  our adviser may recommend that we use a valuation by spse or  if that is unavailable  a dcf valuation technique 

table of contents portfolio investments in non controlled companies comprised of a bundle of investments  which can include debt and equity securities we value non public debt securities that are purchased together with equity or equity like securities from the same portfolio company  or issuer  for which we do not control or cannot gain control as of the measurement date  using a hypothetical secondary market as our principal market 
in accordance with asc  we determine the fair value of these debt securities of non control investments assuming the sale of an individual debt security using the in exchange premise of value 
as such  we estimate the fair value of the debt component using estimates of value provided by spse and our own assumptions in the absence of observable market data  including synthetic credit ratings  estimated remaining life  current market yield and interest rate spreads of similar securities as of the measurement date 
subsequent to june   for equity or equity like securities of investments for which we do not control or cannot gain control as of the measurement date  we estimate the fair value of the equity using the in exchange premise of value based on factors such as the overall value of the issuer  the relative fair value of other units of account including debt  or other relative value approaches 
consideration also is given to capital structure and other contractual obligations that may impact the fair value of the equity 
further  we may utilize comparable values of similar companies  recent investments and indices with similar structures and risk characteristics or our own assumptions in the absence of other observable market data and may also employ dcf valuation techniques 
portfolio investments comprised of non publicly traded non control equity securities of other funds we value any uninvested capital of the non control fund at par value and value any invested capital at the value provided by the non control fund 
due to the uncertainty inherent in the valuation process  such estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the values that would have been obtained had a ready market for the securities existed  and the differences could be material 
additionally  changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned 
there is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith  as fair value depends upon circumstances of each individual case 
in general  fair value is the amount that we might reasonably expect to receive upon the current sale of the security in an arms length transaction in the security s principal market 
valuation considerations from time to time  depending on certain circumstances  the adviser may use the following valuation considerations  including but not limited to the nature and realizable value of the collateral  the portfolio company s earnings and cash flows and its ability to make payments on its obligations  the markets in which the portfolio company does business  the comparison to publicly traded companies  and dcf and other relevant factors 
because such valuations  particularly valuations of private securities and private companies  are not susceptible to precise determination  may fluctuate over short periods of time  and may be based on estimates  our determinations of fair value may differ from the values that might have actually resulted had a readily available market for these securities been available 
credit information our adviser monitors a wide variety of key credit statistics that provide information regarding our portfolio companies to help us assess credit quality and portfolio performance 
we and our adviser participate in the periodic board meetings of our portfolio companies in which we hold control and affiliate investments and also require them to provide annual audited and monthly unaudited financial statements 
using these statements or comparable information and board discussions  our adviser calculates and evaluates the credit statistics 
loan grading and risk rating as part of our valuation procedures above  we risk rate all of our investments in debt securities 
for syndicated loans that have been rated by an nrsro as defined in rule a under the act  we use the nrsro s risk rating for such security 
for all other debt securities  we use a proprietary risk rating system 
our risk rating system uses a scale of to  with being the lowest probability of default 
this system is used to estimate the probability of default on debt securities and the probability of loss if there is a default 
these types of systems are referred to as risk rating systems and are used by banks and rating agencies 
the risk rating system covers both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the business and the securities we hold 
for the debt securities for which we do not use a third party nrsro risk rating  we seek to have our risk rating system mirror the risk rating systems of major risk rating organizations  such as those provided by an nrsro 
while we seek to 
table of contents mirror the nrsro systems  we cannot provide any assurance that our risk rating system will provide the same risk rating as an nrsro for these securities 
the following chart is an estimate of the relationship of our risk rating system to the designations used by two nrsros as they risk rate debt securities of major companies 
because our system rates debt securities of companies that are unrated by any nrsro  there can be no assurance that the correlation to the nrsro set out below is accurate 
we believe our risk rating would be significantly higher than a typical nrsro risk rating because the risk rating of the typical nrsro is designed for larger businesses 
however  our risk rating has been designed to risk rate the securities of smaller businesses that are not rated by a typical nrsro 
therefore  when we use our risk rating on larger business securities  the risk rating is higher than a typical nrsro rating 
the primary difference between our risk rating and the rating of a typical nrsro is that our risk rating uses more quantitative determinants and includes qualitative determinants that we believe are not used in the nrsro rating 
it is our understanding that most debt securities of medium sized companies do not exceed the grade of bbb on an nrsro scale  so there would be no debt securities in the middle market that would meet the definition of aaa  aa or a 
therefore  our scale begins with the designation as the best risk rating which may be equivalent to a bbb from an nrsro  however  no assurance can be given that a on our scale is equal to a bbb on an nrsro scale 
company s system first nrsro second nrsro description a baa bbb probability of default pd during the next ten years is and the expected loss el is or less baa bbb pd is and the el is to ba bb pd is and the el is to ba bb pd is and the el is to ba bb pd is and the el is to b b pd is and the el is to b b pd is and the el is to b b pd is and the el is to caa ccc pd is and the el is to caa ccc pd is and the el is to caa cc pd is and the el is to n a d pd is or there is a payment default and the el is greater than a the default rates set forth are for a ten year term debt security 
if a debt security is less than ten years  then the probability of default is adjusted to a lower percentage for the shorter period  which may move the security higher on our risk rating scale 
the above scale gives an indication of the probability of default and the magnitude of the loss if there is a default 
generally  when a loan becomes days or more past due or if our qualitative assessment indicates that the debtor is unable to service its debt or other obligations  we will place the loan on non accrual status and cease recognizing interest income on that loan until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due 
however  we remain contractually entitled to this interest 
interest payments received on non accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to the cost basis depending upon management s judgment 
non accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest are paid and in management s judgment  are likely to remain current  or due to a restructuring such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible 
at september   three non control non affiliate investment and five control investments were on non accrual with an aggregate cost basis of approximately million  or of the cost basis of all investments in the company s portfolio  and an aggregate fair value of approximately million  or of the fair value of all investments in the company s portfolio 
at september   two non control non affiliate investments and four control investments were on non accrual with an aggregate cost basis of approximately million  or of the cost basis of all investments in the company s portfolio  and an aggregate fair value of approximately million  or of the fair value of all investments in the company s portfolio 
additionally  we do not risk rate our equity securities

as a ric  we are not subject to federal income tax on the portion of our taxable income and gains distributed to stockholders 
to qualify as a ric  we must meet certain source of income  asset diversification and annual distribution requirements 
under the annual distribution requirements  we are required to distribute to stockholders at least of our investment company taxable income  as defined by the code 
our policy is to pay out as distributions up to of that amount 
in an effort to avoid certain excise taxes imposed on rics  we currently intend to distribute  during each calendar year  an amount at least equal to the sum of of our ordinary income for the calendar year  of our capital gains in excess of capital losses for the one year period ending on october of the calendar year  and any ordinary income and net capital gains from preceding years that were not distributed during such years 
under the ric modernization act the ric act  for excise tax years beginning january   the minimum distribution requirement for capital gains income has been raised to 
additionally  under the ric act  the company will be permitted to carry forward capital losses incurred in taxable years beginning after september   for an unlimited period 
however  any losses incurred during those future taxable years will be required to be utilized prior to the losses incurred in pre enactment taxable years  which carry an expiration date 
as a result of this ordering rule  pre enactment capital loss carryforwards may be more likely to expire unused 
additionally  post enactment capital loss carryforwards will retain their character as either short term or long term capital losses rather than being considered all short term as permitted under the previous regulation 
we sought and received approval for a change in accounting method from the irs related to our tax treatment for success fees 
as a result  we  in effect  will continue to account for the recognition of income from the success fees upon receipt  or when the amount becomes fixed 
prior to january   we had treated the success fee amount as a capital gain for tax characterization purposes 
however  starting january   the tax characterization of the success fee amount was and will be treated as ordinary income 
the approved change in accounting method does not require us to retroactively change the capital gains treatment of the success fees received prior to january  revenue recognition interest income recognition interest income  adjusted for amortization of premiums and acquisition costs and for the accretion of discounts  is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected 
generally  when a loan becomes days or more past due or if our qualitative assessment indicates that the debtor is unable to service its debt or other obligations  we will place the loan on non accrual status and cease recognizing interest income on that loan until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollar amounts in thousands  unless otherwise indicated market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments 
the prices of securities held by the us may decline in response to certain events  including those directly involving the companies whose securities are owned by us  conditions affecting the general economy  overall market changes  local  regional or global political  social or economic instability  and interest rate fluctuations 
the primary risk we believe we are exposed to is interest rate risk 
because we borrow money to make investments  our net investment is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest those funds 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income 
we use a combination of debt and equity capital to finance our investing activities 
we may use interest rate risk management techniques to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
such techniques may 
table of contents include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the act 
we have analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on interest income net of interest expense 
we target to have approximately of the loans in our portfolio at fixed rates  with approximately made at variable rates 
as of september   our portfolio consisted of the following variable rates with a floor variable rates without a floor or ceiling fixed rates total all of our variable rate loans have rates associated with either the current libor or prime rate 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in interest rates on our net increase in net assets resulting from operations  we have performed the following analysis  which assumes that our balance sheet remains constant and no further actions are taken to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity 
basis point change a increase in interest income increase in interest expense net increase in net assets resulting from operations up basis points up basis points up basis points a as of september   our effective average libor was  thus  a basis point decrease could not occur 
although management believes that this analysis is indicative of our existing interest rate sensitivity  it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality  size and composition of our loan portfolio on the balance sheet and other business developments that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the results under this hypothetical analysis 
we may also experience risk associated with investing in securities of companies with foreign operations 
we currently do not anticipate investing in debt or equity of foreign companies  however  some potential portfolio companies may have operations located outside the us these risks include  but are not limited to  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  imposition of foreign taxes  changes in exportation regulations and political and social instability
