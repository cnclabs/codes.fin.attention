the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we are the leading independent provider of enterprise data integration and data quality software and services 
we generate revenues from sales of software licenses for our enterprise data integration software products  including product upgrades that are not part of post contract services  and from sales of services  which consist of maintenance  consulting  education  and subscription services 
we receive revenues from licensing our products under perpetual licenses directly to end users and indirectly through resellers  distributors  and oems in the united states and internationally 
we receive service revenues from maintenance contracts  consulting services  and education services that we perform for customers that license our products either directly or indirectly 
we also receive a small but increasing amount of revenues from our customers and partners under subscription based licenses for a variety of cloud and address validation offerings 
most of our international sales have been in europe  and revenues outside of europe and north america have comprised or less of total consolidated revenues during the past three years 
we license our software and provide services to many industry sectors  including  but not limited to  energy and utilities  financial services  government and public agencies  healthcare  high technology  insurance  manufacturing  retail  services  telecommunications  and transportation 
we were able to grow our total revenues in by to million from million in license revenues grew year over year  primarily due to continued market acceptance of our products for broader data integration projects  and to a lesser degree  revenues from recent acquisitions 
services revenues increased year over year due to growth in maintenance revenues and a increase in consulting  education  and other revenues 
the maintenance revenue growth is attributable to the increased size of our installed customer base  and the increase in consulting  education  and other revenues is due to higher customer demand  increased utilization rates  and increased subscriptions 
our operating income as a percentage of revenues has increased slightly to in from in due to our dynamic market  we face both significant opportunities and challenges  and as such  we focus on the following key factors macroeconomic conditions the united states and many foreign economies continue to experience uncertainty driven by varying macroeconomic conditions 
although some of these economies have shown signs of improvement  macroeconomic recovery remains uneven 
uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment and associated global economic conditions have resulted in extreme volatility in credit  equity  and foreign currency markets  including the european sovereign debt markets and volatility in various markets including the financial services sector  which typically is the largest vertical segment that we serve 
in addition  in  we experienced a decline in european public sector 
table of contents transactions  and we continue to expect uncertainty in european public sector spending 
furthermore  we have made incremental investments in asia pacific and latin america  and have maintained a high level of investments in europe  the middle east  and africa emea 
there are significant risks with overseas investments  and our growth prospects in these regions are uncertain 
competition inherent in our industry are risks arising from competition with existing software solutions  including solutions from ibm  oracle  and sap  technological advances from other vendors  and the perception of cost savings by solving data integration challenges through customer hand coding development resources 
our prospective customers may view these alternative solutions as more attractive than our offerings 
additionally  the consolidation activity in our industry including oracle s acquisition of bea systems  goldengate  hyperion solutions  siebel  silvercreek  sun microsystems  and sunopsis  ibm s acquisition of ascential software  cast iron systems  cognos  datamirror  initiate systems  and spss  and sap s acquisition of business objects  which had previously acquired firstlogic  and sybase  and tibco software acquisition of netrics pose challenges as competitors market a broader suite of software products or solutions to our existing or prospective customers 
product introductions and enhancements to address the expanding data integration and data quality needs of our customers and prospective customers  we introduce new products and technology enhancements on a regular basis  including products we acquire 
for example  in january  we extended our existing mdm offering through the acquisition of siperian 
in february  we launched informatica data cloud store  the industry first infrastructure as a service offering to archive database and enterprise application data to the cloud in a cost effective and secure manner 
in march  we acquired west and their family of ultra messaging products 
in june  we delivered the informatica cloud summer release 
in december  we announced informatica cloud express  the first cloud data integration service with usage based pricing 
the introduction of new products  integration of acquired products and enhancement of existing products  is a complex process involving inherent risks  and to which we devote significant resources 
we cannot predict the impact of new or enhanced products on our overall sales and we may not generate sufficient revenues to justify their costs 
quarterly and seasonal fluctuations historically  purchasing patterns in the software industry have followed quarterly and seasonal trends and are likely to do so in the future 
specifically  it is normal for us to recognize a substantial portion of our new license orders in the last month of each quarter and sometimes in the last few weeks or days of each quarter  though such fluctuations are mitigated somewhat by recognition of backlog orders 
in recent years  the fourth quarter has had the highest level of license revenues and order backlog  and we generally have weaker demand for our software products and services in the first and third quarters of the year 
the first  second  and fourth quarters of and followed these seasonal trends 
however  license revenues in the third quarter were essentially flat with the second quarter in both years 
the current uncertain macroeconomic conditions make our historical seasonal trends more difficult to predict 
to address these potential risks  we have focused on a number of key initiatives  including certain cost containment measures  the strengthening of our partnerships  the broadening of our distribution capability worldwide  the targeting of our sales force and distribution channel on new products  and strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses  products  and technologies 
if we are unable to execute these key initiatives successfully  we may not be able to sustain the growth rates we have experienced recently 
as a result of improvements in our business prospects and with the expectation of uneven yet continued progress towards macroeconomic recovery  we have increased our hiring and  as noted above  have recently completed acquisitions 
we concentrate on maintaining and strengthening our relationships with our existing strategic partners and building relationships with additional strategic partners 
these partners include systems integrators  resellers and distributors  and strategic technology partners  including enterprise application providers  database vendors  and enterprise information integration vendors  in the united states and internationally 
for example  in november  we announced a partnership with cloudera  a provider of apache hadoop based data management software and services  to provide solutions for addressing the challenges associated with managing large scale data  including structured  complex and social data 
additionally  in july  we entered into a partnership with dun bradstreet with respect to informatica cloud  and in may  we announced a partnership with emc to resell our information lifecycle management ilm and mdm products and services 
in addition  we are partners with hewlett packard  intel  microsoft  oracle  salesforce 
com  and sap  among others 
see risk factors we rely on our relationships with our strategic partners 
if we do not maintain and strengthen these relationships  our ability to generate revenue and control expenses could be adversely affected  which could cause a decline in the price of our common stock in part i  item a of this report 
we have broadened our distribution efforts  and we have continued to expand our sales both in terms of selling data warehouse products to the enterprise level and of selling more strategic data integration solutions beyond data warehousing  including enterprise data integration  data quality  master data management  bb data exchange  application information lifecycle management  
table of contents complex event processing  ultra messaging  and cloud data integration to our customers enterprise architects and chief information officers 
we also have opened the informatica marketplace  which allows buyers and sellers to share and leverage data integration solutions 
additionally  we have expanded our international sales presence in recent years by opening new offices  increasing headcount  and through acquisitions 
as a result of this international expansion  as well as the increase in our direct sales headcount in the united states  our sales and marketing expenses have increased 
in the long term  we expect these investments to result in increased revenues and productivity and ultimately higher profitability 
if we experience an increase in sales personnel turnover  do not achieve expected increases in our sales pipeline  experience a decline in our sales pipeline conversion ratio  or do not achieve increases in sales productivity and efficiencies from our new sales personnel as they gain more experience  then it is unlikely that we will achieve our expected increases in revenue  sales productivity  or profitability from our international operations 
we have experienced some increases in revenues and sales productivity in the united states in the past few years 
we experienced a continued increase in sales productivity in the united states in while we have not yet achieved the same level of sales productivity internationally as we have in the united states  we did experience a slight increase in international sales productivity in to address the risks of introducing new products  we have continued to invest in programs to help train our internal sales force and our external distribution channel on new product functionalities  key differentiations  and key business values 
these programs include user conferences for customers and partners  our annual sales kickoff conference for all sales and key marketing personnel  webinars for our direct sales force and indirect distribution channel  in person technical seminars for our pre sales consultants  the building of product demonstrations  and creation and distribution of targeted marketing collateral 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states  which require us to make estimates  judgments  and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments  and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these assumptions  judgments  and estimates are made 
these estimates  judgments  and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
any material differences between these estimates and actual results will impact our consolidated financial statements 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our estimates  judgments  and assumptions and make changes accordingly 
we also discuss our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe that the estimates  judgments  and assumptions involved in the accounting for revenue recognition  facilities restructuring charges  income taxes  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  acquisitions  stock based compensation  and allowance for doubtful accounts have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
we discuss below the critical accounting estimates associated with these policies 
historically  our estimates  judgments  and assumptions relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
see note summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report for further information on our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with gaap prescribed for the software industry 
the accounting rules related to revenue recognition are complex and are affected by interpretations of such rules 
these rules and their interpretations are often subject to change 
consequently  the revenue recognition process requires management to make significant judgments  for example  to determine if collectability is probable 
we derive revenues from software license fees  maintenance fees which entitle the customer to receive product support and unspecified software updates  professional services  consisting of consulting and education services  and other revenues  primarily consisting of subscriptions for address validation and cloud services 
we follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue 
the basis for recognizing software license revenue is determined by software revenue recognition asc  revenue recognition for construction type and production type contracts asc  and the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition  which is discussed in the subsection revenue recognition in note summary of significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
substantially all of our software licenses are perpetual licenses under which the customer acquires the perpetual right to use the software as provided and subject to the conditions of the license agreement 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
in applying these criteria to revenue transactions  we must exercise judgment and use estimates to determine the amount of software  maintenance  and professional services revenue to be recognized at each period 
we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable prior to recognizing revenue 
we must make interpretations of our customer 
table of contents contracts and exercise judgments in determining if the fees associated with a license arrangement are fixed or determinable 
we consider factors including extended payment terms  financing arrangements  the category of customer end user customer or reseller  rights of return or refund  and our history of enforcing the terms and conditions of customer contracts 
if the fee due from a customer is not fixed or determinable due to extended payment terms  revenue is recognized when payment becomes due or upon cash receipt  whichever is earlier 
revenue arrangements from resellers and distributors are recognized on a sell through basis upon shipment to the end user provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met  which in most cases is when cash is collected 
further  we make judgments in determining the collectability of the amounts due from our customers that could possibly impact the timing of revenue recognition 
we assess credit worthiness and collectability  and when a customer is not deemed credit worthy  revenue is recognized when payment is received 
our software license arrangements include the following multiple elements license fees from our core software products and or product upgrades that are not part of post contract services  maintenance fees  consulting  and or education services 
we use the residual method to recognize license revenue upon delivery when the arrangement includes elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists to allocate the fee to the undelivered elements of the arrangement 
vsoe is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately 
if vsoe does not exist for any undelivered software product element of the arrangement  all revenue is deferred until all elements have been delivered  or vsoe is established 
if vsoe does not exist for any undelivered services elements of the arrangement  all revenue is recognized ratably over the period that the services are expected to be performed 
we are required to exercise judgment in determining if vsoe exists for each undelivered element 
consulting services  if included as part of the software arrangement  generally do not require significant modification or customization of the software 
if  in our judgment  the software arrangement includes significant modification or customization of the software  then software license revenue is recognized as the consulting services revenue is recognized 
consulting revenues are primarily related to implementation of services and product configurations 
these services are performed on a time and materials basis and  occasionally  on a fixed fee basis 
revenue is generally recognized as these services are performed 
if uncertainty exists about our ability to complete the project  our ability to collect the amounts due  or in the case of fixed fee consulting arrangements  our ability to estimate the remaining costs to be incurred to complete the project  revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is resolved 
other revenues  primarily consisting of subscriptions for address validation and cloud services  are recognized as the services are delivered 
multiple contracts with a single counterparty executed within close proximity of each other are evaluated to determine if the contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single arrangement 
we recognize revenues net of applicable sales taxes  financing charges that we have absorbed  and amounts retained by our resellers and distributors  if any 
our agreements do not permit returns  and historically we have not had any significant returns or refunds  therefore  we have not established a sales return reserve at this time 
facilities restructuring charges during the fourth quarter of  we recorded significant charges restructuring plan related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters  to take advantage of more favorable lease terms and reduce our operating expenses 
the accrued restructuring charges represent the net present value of lease obligations and estimated broker commissions and other costs principally leasehold improvements and asset write offs  offset by actual and estimated gross sublease income  which is net of estimated broker commissions and tenant improvement allowances  expected to be received over the remaining lease terms 
in addition  we significantly increased the restructuring charges restructuring plan in the third and fourth quarters of due to changes in our assumptions used to calculate the original charges as a result of our decision to relocate our corporate headquarters 
these liabilities include management s estimates pertaining to sublease activities 
inherent in the assessment of the costs related to our restructuring efforts are estimates related to the probability weighted outcomes of the significant actions to accomplish the restructuring 
we will continue to evaluate the commercial real estate market conditions periodically to determine if our estimates of the amount and timing of future sublease income are reasonable based on current and expected commercial real estate market conditions 
our estimates of sublease income may vary significantly depending  in part  on factors that may be beyond our control  such as the global economic downturn  time periods required to locate and contract suitable subleases  and market rates at the time of subleases 
currently  we have subleased our excess facilities in connection with our and facilities restructuring for durations that comprise a majority of the remaining lease terms through future adjustments to the charges could result from any default by a sublessor  which could impact the time period that the buildings will be vacant  expected sublease rates  expected sublease terms  and the expected time it will take to sublease 

table of contents see note facilities restructuring charges of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes 
under this method  income tax expenses or benefits are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
we account for any income tax contingencies in accordance with asc the measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of currently enacted tax laws 
the effects of any future changes in tax laws or rates have not been taken into account with the exception of revaluing deferred taxes for california relating to and thereafter 
as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes and tax contingencies in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in net deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realizable  and to the extent we believe that a deferred tax asset is not likely to be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
in assessing the need for any additional valuation allowance  we considered all the evidence available to us  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  legislative developments  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income  and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
accounting for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets we assess goodwill for impairment annually on october of each year and whenever an event or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
consistent with our determination that we have only one reporting segment  we have determined that there is only one reporting unit and goodwill for impairment at the entity level 
we test goodwill using the two step process required by asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
in the first step  we compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit to the fair value based on quoted market prices of our common stock 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value  goodwill is not considered impaired and no further testing is required 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  goodwill is potentially impaired and the second step of the impairment test must be performed 
in the second step  if such comparison reflects potential impairment  we would compare the implied fair value of the goodwill  as defined by asc  to its carrying amount to determine the amount of impairment loss  if any 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment tests on october    and and concluded that there was no impairment 
we evaluate intangible assets  other than goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset 
the company measures any amount of impairment based on the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset 
the company did not recognize any impairment charges of long lived assets in   or we have made assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives which are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe that the assumptions and estimates that we have made are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
business combinations in  the company adopted asc  business combinations  which revised the accounting guidance for acquisitions in comparison to prior years 
the guidance requires the company to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets  support obligations assumed  estimated restructuring liabilities  and pre acquisition contingencies 
as a result of the adoption of the revised accounting guidance in asc  the company accounting for acquisitions in and after in comparison to the accounting for acquisitions prior to differs 
under the new accounting pronouncement  the company expenses transaction costs and restructuring expenses related to the acquisition as incurred 
prior to  direct transaction costs were included as part of the purchase price  and restructuring expenses were included as part of the assumed 
table of contents obligations in deriving the purchase price allocation 
further  pursuant to asc  the company identifies pre acquisition contingencies and determines their respective fair values as of the end of the purchase price allocation period 
the company records any adjustments to pre acquisition contingencies in the company operating results in the period in which the adjustment is determined 
furthermore  any adjustments to estimates of acquisition related tax contingencies are recorded to goodwill during the measurement period and in the company operating results after the conclusion of the measurement period 
prior to  any such adjustments were included as part of the purchase price allocation 
moreover  the company identifies in process research and development costs  determines their respective fair values  and includes them as part of the purchase price allocation 
in process research and development costs  under the new guidance  meet the definition of an asset  and the company classifies them as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the asset is put to use or deemed to be impaired 
prior to  in process research and development was expensed at the acquisition date 
accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
although we believe the estimates and assumptions that we have made are reasonable and appropriate  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
the following are some of the examples of critical estimates that we have applied in our acquisitions future expected cash flows from software license sales  support agreements  consulting contracts  other customer contracts  and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand and competitive position as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy of our estimates and assumptions 
in connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions  we estimate the fair value of the support obligations assumed 
the estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build up approach 
the cost build up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin 
the estimated costs to fulfill the support obligations are based on the historical costs related to fulfilling the obligations 
the sum of these costs and operating profit approximates  in theory  the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the support obligations 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of asc  stock compensation 
stock based awards granted include stock options  restricted stock units rsus  and stock purchased under the company employee stock purchase plan espp 
stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards and is recognized as an expense ratably on a straight line basis over its requisite service period 
it requires a certain amount of judgment to select the appropriate fair value model and calculate the fair value of stock based awards  including estimating stock price volatility and expected life 
further  estimates of forfeiture rates could shift stock based compensation expense from one period to the next 
we have estimated the expected volatility as an input into the black scholes merton valuation formula when assessing the fair value of options granted 
our current estimate of volatility is based upon a blend of average historical and market based implied volatilities of our stock price 
our volatility rates were   and for   and  respectively 
the decrease in volatility rates in from and in from was due to a decline in the implied components of our volatility rates 
our historical volatility in decreased slightly compared to and remained relatively unchanged in compared to our implied volatility rates declined in compared to and in compared to to the extent that the volatility rate in our stock price increases in the future  our estimates of the fair value of options granted will increase accordingly 
we do not expect that changes in the volatility rates to impact our future stock based compensation expense materially due to the limited amount of recent option grants 
we derived our expected life of the options that we granted in from the historical option exercises  post vesting cancellations  and estimates concerning future exercises and cancellations for vested and unvested options that remain outstanding 
we increased our expected life estimate from years in to years in the higher expected life of options was mainly due to lower forfeitures in we do not expect that changes in the expected life to impact our future stock based compensation expense materially due to the limited amount of recent option grants 

table of contents in addition  we apply an expected forfeiture rate in determining the amount of stock based compensation 
we use historical forfeitures to estimate our future forfeiture rates 
we increased our forfeiture rate for stock options from in to in while the total stock options forfeited was relatively consistent  the number of stock options granted to employees decreased 
the impact on our stock compensation for due to the change in our forfeiture rate was negligible 
the forfeiture rate for rsus remained at for both and we believe that the estimates that we have used for the calculation of the variables to arrive at stock based compensation expense are reasonable and appropriate 
the assumptions entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock based awards are subjective estimates  and changes to these estimates will cause the fair value of our stock based awards and related stock based compensation expense that we record to vary 
we will continue to monitor the historical performance of these variables and will modify our methodology and assumptions in the future as needed

the increase in license revenues in from was primarily due to an increase in the volume of transactions  partially offset by a decrease in the average size of the transactions 
our growth in license revenues reflects the continued market acceptance of our products beyond data warehousing and the adoption of new technologies 
the number of transactions greater than million increased to in from and  in and  respectively 
the total number of new customers that we added in   and  including the number of customers added through acquisitions  was   and  respectively

consulting and education  and other services revenues consulting  education  and other services revenues were million or of total revenues in  million or of total revenues in  and million or of total revenues in the million or increase in compared to was primarily due to an increase in consulting revenues in north america as a result of higher customer demand  increased utilization rates  and increased subscriptions 
the million or decrease in compared to was primarily due to our customers trend toward deferring spending and reducing education and consulting budgets 
the decline occurred primarily in the first half of and stabilized subsequently during the second half as the macroeconomic environment improved 
we expect our revenues from consulting  education  and other services to increase in from the levels 

table of contents international revenues our international revenues were million or of total revenues in  million or of total revenues in  and million or of total revenues in  representing an increase of million or in from and an increase of million or in from international revenues in all major geographic regions increased in compared to the million or increase in from was primarily due to an increase in international license revenues in europe and asia pacific and an increase in maintenance revenue in all major geographic regions as a result of a larger and growing installed customer base 
the million or increase in from was primarily due to an increase in international maintenance revenue as a result of a larger and growing installed customer base  and an increase in international license and service revenues in latin america and in europe 
we expect international revenues as a percentage of total revenues in to be relatively consistent with potential future revenues new orders  backlog  and deferred revenue our potential future revenues include backlog consisting primarily of product license orders that have not shipped as of the end of a given quarter  product license orders received from certain distributors  resellers  oems  and end users not included in deferred revenues  where revenue is recognized based on cash receipt collectively and above are referred as aggregate backlog  and deferred revenues 
our deferred revenues consist primarily of the following maintenance revenues that we recognize over the term of the contract  typically one year  license product orders that have shipped but where the terms of the license agreement contain acceptance language or other terms that require that the license revenues be deferred until all revenue recognition criteria are met or recognized ratably over an extended period  and consulting and education services revenues that have been prepaid but for which services have not yet been performed 
we typically ship products shortly after the receipt of an order  which is common in the software industry  and historically our backlog of license orders awaiting shipment at the end of any given quarter has varied 
however  our backlog historically decreases from the prior quarter at the end of the first and third quarters and increases at the end of the fourth quarter 
the increase  however  was less pronounced at the end of aggregate backlog and deferred revenues at december  were approximately million compared to million at december  this increase in was primarily due to an increase in deferred maintenance revenues and an increase in license backlog 
aggregate backlog and deferred revenues as of any particular date are not necessarily indicative of future results

cost of license revenues was million or of license revenues in  million or of license revenues in  and million or of license revenues in the million or increase in from 
table of contents was primarily due to a proportional increase in license revenues 
the million or decrease in from was primarily due to the smaller proportion of royalty based products being shipped in we expect that our cost of license revenues as a percentage of license revenues in to be consistent with or slightly higher than levels 
cost of service revenues our cost of service revenues is a combination of costs of maintenance  consulting  education  and other services revenues 
our cost of maintenance revenues consists primarily of costs associated with customer service personnel expenses and royalty fees for maintenance related to third party software providers 
cost of consulting revenues consists primarily of personnel costs and expenses incurred in providing consulting services at customers facilities 
cost of education services revenues consists primarily of the costs of providing education classes and materials at our headquarters  sales and training offices  and customer locations 
cost of other services revenue consists primarily of fees paid to postal authorities and other third parties for content and hosting costs for our subscription services

investing activities net cash used in investing activities were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
we acquire property and equipment in our normal course of business 
the amount and timing of these purchases and the related cash outflows in future periods depend on a number of factors  including the hiring of employees  the rate of upgrade of computer hardware and software used in our business  as well as our business outlook 
we have identified our investment portfolio as available for sale  and our investment objectives are to preserve principal and provide liquidity while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
we may sell an investment at any time if the credit rating of the investment declines  the yield on the investment is no longer attractive  or we need additional cash 
we invest only in money market funds and marketable debt securities 
we believe that the purchase  maturity  or sale of our investments has no material impact on our overall liquidity 
we have used cash to acquire businesses and technologies that enhance and expand our product offerings  and we anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future 
due to the nature of these transactions  it is difficult to predict the amount and timing

as part of the acquisition purchase price  we wrote off million in prepaid royalties to addressdoctor 
in september  we acquired all the capital stock of agent logic  which specializes in the development and marketing of complex event processing software which supports security initiatives in highly complex environments  for million  of which million is held in an escrow fund as security for losses accrued by informatica in the event of certain breaches of the merger agreement by agent logic 
the escrow fund will remain in place for a period of months  although a portion of the escrow funds were paid out in september in january  we acquired siperian  a privately held company  in a cash merger transaction valued at approximately million  of which approximately million was placed in an escrow fund as security for losses accrued by informatica in the event of certain breaches of the merger agreement by siperian 
as a result of this acquisition  we assumed certain facility leases and certain liabilities and commitments 
the escrow fund will remain in place until july   although a portion of the escrow funds were paid out in february in february  we made a million investment in the preferred stock of another privately held company  which was classified as level for fair value measurement purposes

although we expect to continue to receive some proceeds from the issuance of common stock to option holders and participants of espp in future periods  the timing and amount of such proceeds are difficult to predict and are contingent on a number of factors  including the price of our common stock  the number of employees participating in our stock option plans and our employee stock purchase plan  and overall market conditions

we have million available to repurchase additional shares of our common stock or redeem our convertible senior notes under this program as of december  in january  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional million of our outstanding common stock and notes under the repurchase program 
purchases can be made from time to time in the open market and will be funded from our available cash 
the primary purpose of these programs is to enhance shareholder value by partially offsetting the dilutive impact of stock based incentive plans 
the number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases are based on several factors  including the price of our common stock  our liquidity and working capital needs  general business and market conditions  and other investment opportunities 
the repurchased shares are retired and reclassified as authorized and unissued shares of common stock 
see part ii  item of this report for more information regarding the stock repurchase program 
we may continue to repurchase shares and convertible senior notes from time to time  as determined by management as authorized by the board of directors 
we believe that our cash balances and the cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
however  we may be required to raise or desire additional funds for selective purposes  such as acquisitions  and may raise such additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing or from other sources 
after march   we may from time to time redeem the notes  in whole or in part  for cash  at a redemption price equal to the full principal amount of the notes  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
further  on march  and then upon march   and march   or upon the occurrence of certain events including a change in control  holders of the notes may require the company to repurchase all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price in cash equal to the full principal amount of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest as of the relevant date 
in february  we called for redemption on march  all of the remaining notes 
while we expect holders to convert the notes into shares prior to the redemption date  if our stock price declines and the interest rates rise significantly  we may be required to settle the notes in cash 
if we are unable to meet the obligations out of cash flows from operations or other available funds  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings 
we may not be able to borrow money or sell more of our equity securities to meet our cash needs for reasons including the tightening of the capital markets 
even if we are able to do so  it may not be on terms that are favorable or reasonable to us 
credit agreement in september  we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement that matures in september the credit agreement provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility in an amount of up to million  with an option for us to request to increase the revolving loan commitments by an aggregate amount of up to million with new or additional commitments  for a total credit facility of up to million 
no amounts were outstanding under the credit agreement as of december  and a total of million remained available for borrowing 
the credit agreement contains customary representations and warranties  covenants and events of default  including the requirement to maintain a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of to and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of to

our contractual obligations at december  include the lease term for our headquarters office in redwood city  california  which is from december  to december  minimum contractual lease payments are million  million  and million for the years ending december    and  respectively 
the above commitment table does not include approximately million of long term income tax liabilities recorded in accordance with asc  income taxes 
we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of these potential future payments in individual years beyond months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes 
as a result  this amount is not included in the table above 
for further information  see note income taxes of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
contractual obligations purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of certain goods and services are not included in the preceding table 
we cannot determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum  or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the table above 
we estimate the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations

of these future minimum lease payments  we have million recorded in accrued facilities restructuring charges at december  this accrual  in addition to minimum lease payments of million  includes estimated operating expenses of million  is net of estimated sublease income of million  and is net of the present value impact of million recorded in accordance with asc  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
we estimated sublease income and the related timing thereof based on existing sublease agreements and current market conditions  among other factors 
our estimates of sublease income may vary significantly from actual amounts realized depending  in part  on factors that may be beyond our control  such as the time periods required to locate and contract suitable subleases and the market rates at the time of such subleases 
in relation to our excess facilities  we may decide to negotiate and enter into lease termination agreements  if and when the circumstances are appropriate 
these lease termination agreements would likely require that a significant amount of the remaining future lease payments be paid at the time of execution of the agreement  but would release us from future lease payment obligations for the abandoned facility 
the timing of a lease termination agreement and the corresponding payment could materially affect our cash flows in the period of payment 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different 
we have sublease agreements for leased office space at the pacific shores center in redwood city  california 
in the event the sublessees are unable to fulfill their obligations  we would be responsible for rent due under the leases 
we expect at this time that the sublessees will fulfill their obligations under the terms of the current lease agreements 
in february  we entered into two lease agreements for two buildings at the pacific shores center in redwood city  california our former corporate headquarters  which we occupied from august through december these two lease agreements will expire in july off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements  transactions  or relationships with special purpose entities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk we market and sell our software and services through our direct sales force and indirect channel partners in north america  europe and middle east  asia pacific  latin america  and russia 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is their local currencies  except for informatica cayman ltd  which uses euros as its functional currency 
our exposure to foreign exchange risk is related to the magnitude of foreign net profits and losses denominated in foreign currencies  in particular the euro and british pound sterling  as well as our net position of monetary assets and monetary liabilities held by our foreign subsidiaries in their non functional currencies 
these exposures have the potential to produce either gains or losses within our consolidated results 
our foreign operations  however  in most instances act as a natural hedge since both operating expenses as well as revenues are generally denominated in their respective local currency 
in these instances  although an unfavorable change in the exchange rate of foreign currencies against the us dollar will result in lower revenues when translated into us dollars  the operating expenses will be lower as well 
our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the australian dollar  brazilian real  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  euro  indian rupee  israeli shekel  japanese yen  and swiss franc 
cash flow hedge activities we have attempted to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations through initiation of certain cash flow hedge programs starting in the fourth quarter of the purpose of these programs is to reduce volatility in cash flows and expenses caused by movement in certain foreign currency exchange rates  in particular the euro  indian rupee  and israeli shekel 
under these programs  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other 
table of contents comprehensive income loss and is reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings 
the foreign exchange contracts initiated in the fourth quarter of expired in january  and the company entered into additional foreign exchange contracts in december under the company s hedging programs with monthly expiration dates through january the table below presents the notional amounts of the foreign exchange forward contracts that informatica committed to purchase in the fourth quarter of for euros  indian rupees  and israeli shekels  which were outstanding as of december  in thousands foreign amount usd equivalent functional currency notional amount sold notional amount purchased notional amount sold notional amount purchased weighted average rate euro indian rupee israeli shekel see note summary of significant accounting policies  note accumulated other comprehensive income  note derivative financial instruments  and note commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion 
we record the effective portion of changes in fair value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
when the forecasted transaction occurs  we reclassify the effective portion related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to operating expenditures 
if the hedge program becomes ineffective or if the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur for any reason  or it becomes probable that it will not occur  we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer  or type of investment 
our investments consist primarily of us government and agency notes and bonds  corporate bonds  commercial paper and municipal securities 
all investments are carried at market value  which approximates cost 
see note cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
the following table presents the fair value of cash equivalents and short term investments that are subject to interest rate risk and the average interest rate as of december  and dollars in thousands december  cash equivalents and short term investments average rate of return our cash equivalents and short term investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
as of december   we had net unrealized gains of million associated with these securities 
if market interest rates were to change immediately and uniformly by basis points from levels as of december   the fair market value of the portfolio would change by approximately million 
additionally  we have the ability to hold our investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not necessarily expect to realize an adverse impact on income or cash flows 
at this time  we do not expect a significant change in our average rate of return in
