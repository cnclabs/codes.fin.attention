item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to the historical information  the discussion contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements due to applications of our critical accounting policies and factors including  but not limited to  those set forth under the caption risk factors in item a of part i of this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading provider of clean and intelligent energy management applications and services for the smart grid  which include comprehensive demand response  data driven energy efficiency  energy price and risk management  and enterprise carbon management applications and services 
our energy management applications and services enable cost effective energy management strategies for our c i customers and our electric power grid operator and utility customers by reducing real time demand for electricity  increasing energy efficiency  improving energy supply transparency  and mitigating emissions 
we use our network operations center  or noc  and comprehensive demand response application  demandsmart  to remotely manage and reduce electricity consumption across a growing network of c i customer sites  making demand response capacity available to electric power grid operators and utilities on demand while helping c i customers achieve energy savings  improved financial results and environmental benefits 
as of december   we managed over  mw of demand response capacity across a c i customer base of approximately  accounts and  sites throughout multiple electric power grids 
we build on our position as a leading demand response services provider by using our noc and energy management application platform to deliver a portfolio of additional energy management applications and services to new and existing c i  electric power grid operator and utility customers 
these additional energy management applications and services include our efficiencysmart  supplysmart and carbonsmart applications and services 
since inception  our business has grown substantially 
we began by providing demand response services in one state in and had expanded to providing our portfolio of energy management applications and services in several regions throughout the united states  as well as internationally in canada and the united kingdom by december  significant recent developments in february  we and darren brady  our then current senior vice president and chief operating officer  agreed that mr 
brady would resign as senior vice president and chief operating officer effective february  in january  we acquired mm pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger  which we refer to as the mm merger agreement 
mm is a leading provider of wireless technology solutions for energy management and demand response 
the total merger consideration paid by us at closing was million  plus an additional million paid as a result of mm having a positive capitalization amount at closing  of which million was paid in shares of our common stock and the balance of which was paid in cash 
an aggregate of million of the merger consideration  consisting of cash and shares of our common stock  was retained by us and will be paid to the stockholders of mm upon the satisfaction of certain conditions contained in the mm merger agreement 
in january  we also acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of global energy  a provider of energy efficiency and demand response programmatic solutions and innovative technology applications 
the total purchase price paid by us at closing was million  of which million was paid in shares of our common stock and the balance of which was paid in cash 

table of contents in december and june  each of james turner and adam grosser  respectively  resigned from our board of directors 
in february  dr 
susan f 
tierney was elected to serve as a member of our board of directors 
in april  we and one of our subsidiaries entered into a second loan modification agreement to the svb credit facility  which increased our borrowing limit from million to million  as well as modified certain of our financial covenant debt compliance requirements 
we and svb further modified the svb credit facility in july and february to  among other things  extend the maturity date of the svb credit facility through march  in march  we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of smallfoot and zox 
smallfoot was in the process of developing wireless systems that manage and coordinate electricity demand for small commercial facilities and zox was in the process of developing hardware and software for automated utility meter reading 
the purchase price for these acquisitions was equal to approximately million  of which million was paid in shares of our common stock and the balance of which was paid in cash 
revenues and expense components revenues we derive recurring revenues from the sale of our energy management applications and services 
we do not recognize any revenues until persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and we deem collection to be reasonably assured 
our revenues from our demand response services primarily consist of capacity and energy payments  including ancillary services payments 
we derive revenues from demand response capacity that we make available in open market programs and pursuant to contracts that we enter into with electric power grid operators and utilities 
in certain markets  we enter into contracts with electric power grid operators and utilities  generally ranging from three to years in duration  to deploy our demand response services 
we refer to these contracts as utility contracts 
where we operate in open market programs  our revenues from demand response capacity payments may vary month to month based upon our enrolled capacity and the market payment rate 
where we have a utility contract  we receive periodic capacity payments  which may vary monthly or seasonally  based upon enrolled capacity and predetermined payment rates 
under both open market programs and utility contracts  we receive capacity payments regardless of whether we are called upon to reduce demand for electricity from the electric power grid  and we recognize revenue over the applicable delivery period  even where payments are made over a different period 
we generally demonstrate our capacity either through a demand response event or a measurement and verification test 
this demonstrated capacity is typically used to calculate the continuing periodic capacity payments to be made to us until the next demand response event or measurement and verification test establishes a new demonstrated capacity amount 
in most cases  we also receive an additional payment for the amount of energy usage that we actually curtail from the grid during a demand response event 
we refer to this as an energy payment 
as program rules may differ for each open market program in which we participate and for each utility contract  we assess whether or not we have met the specific service requirements under the program rules and recognize or defer revenues as necessary 
we recognize demand response capacity revenues when we have provided verification to the electric power grid operator or utility of our ability to deliver the committed capacity under the open market program or utility contract 
committed capacity is verified through the results of an actual demand response event or a measurement and verification test 
once the capacity amount has been verified  the revenues are recognized and future revenues become fixed or determinable and are recognized monthly over the performance period until the next demand response event or measurement and verification test 
in subsequent demand response events or measurement and verification tests  if our verified capacity is below the previously verified amount  the electric power grid operator or utility customer will reduce future payments based on the adjusted verified capacity amounts 
under certain utility contracts and open market program participation rules  our performance and related fees are measured and determined over 
table of contents a period of time 
if we can reliably estimate our performance for the applicable performance period  we will reserve the entire amount of estimated penalties that will be incurred  if any  as a result of estimated underperformance prior to the commencement of revenue recognition 
if we are unable to reliably estimate the performance and any related penalties  we defer the recognition of revenues until the fee is fixed or determinable 
any changes to our original estimates of net revenues are recognized as a change in accounting estimate in the earliest reporting period that such a change is determined 
we defer incremental direct costs incurred related to the acquisition or origination of a utility contract or open market program in a transaction that results in the deferral or delay of revenue recognition 
as of december  and  the incremental direct costs deferred were approximately million and million  respectively 
these deferred expenses would not have been incurred without our participation in a certain open market program and will be expensed in proportion to the related revenue being recognized 
during the years ended december   and  we deferred contract origination costs of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  we capitalize the costs of our production and generation equipment utilized in the delivery of our demand response services and expense this equipment over the lesser of its useful life or the term of the contractual arrangement 
these capitalized costs of million and million at december  and  respectively  are included in property and equipment in our consolidated balance sheets 
we believe that this accounting treatment appropriately matches expenses with the associated revenue 
as of december   we had over  mw under management in our demand response network  meaning that we had entered into definitive contracts with our c i customers representing over  mw of demand response capacity 
we generally begin earning revenues from our mw under management within approximately one month from the date on which we enable the mw  or the date on which we can reduce the mw from the electricity grid if called upon to do so 
the most significant exception is the pjm forward capacity market  which is a market from which we derive a substantial portion of our revenues 
because pjm operates on a june to may program year basis  a mw that we enable after june of each year may not begin earning revenue until june of the following year 
this results in a longer average revenue recognition lag time in our c i customer portfolio from the point in time when we consider a mw to be under management to when we earn revenues from that mw 
certain other markets in which we currently participate  such as the iso ne market  or choose to participate in the future operate or may operate in a manner that could create a delay in recognizing revenue from the mw that we enable in those markets 
additionally  not all of our mw under management may be enrolled in a demand response program or may earn revenue in a given program period or year based on the way that we manage our portfolio of demand response capacity 
revenues generated from open market sales to pjm  a grid operator customer  accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenues for the years ended december   and under certain utility contracts and open market programs  such as pjm s emergency load response program  the period during which we are required to perform may be shorter than the period over which we receive payments under that contract or program 
in these cases  we record revenue  net of reserves for estimated penalties related to potential delivered capacity shortfalls  over the mandatory performance obligation period  and a portion of the revenues that have been earned is recorded and accrued as unbilled revenue 
our unbilled revenue of million as of december  will be billed and collected through may  our unbilled revenue of million as of december  was collected through may  due to the lower pricing that will take effect in the pjm market in and  as well as the discontinuance of the ilr program beginning in and an expected decrease in mw enrolled in the pjm market in as compared to  we currently expect that our revenues derived from the pjm market will significantly decrease as a percentage of our total annual revenues in and as compared to prior years  and that our ability to grow our overall revenues in and at levels consistent with prior years will be negatively impacted 
had the lower pricing that will take effect in the pjm market beginning in been in effect during the year ended december   our revenues for that period would have been lower by approximately million to million 
in addition and in connection with the pjm statement  in the event that ferc does not grant us declaratory relief  or agrees with the pjm statement and modifies the pjm market rules in the future to reflect the pjm statement  or to the extent pjm is otherwise successful at 
table of contents modifying the market rules in the future  our revenues for and beyond could be significantly reduced  currently estimated to be in the range of million to million  however  the ultimate financial impact could deviate from this range and will depend on several factors  including the details of any modified market rule or ferc ruling and the associated timing and market impact of any such rule or ruling 
revenues generated from open market sales to iso ne  a grid operator customer  accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenues for the years ended december   and in addition to demand response revenues  we generally receive either a subscription based fee  consulting fee or a percentage savings fee for arrangements under which we provide our other energy management applications and services  specifically our efficiencysmart  supplysmart and carbonsmart applications and services 
revenues derived from our efficiencysmart  supplysmart and carbonsmart applications and services were million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and our revenues have historically been higher in our second and third fiscal quarters compared to other quarters in our fiscal year due to seasonality related to the demand response market 
cost of revenues cost of revenues for our demand response services consists primarily of amounts owed to our c i customers for their participation in our demand response network and are generally recognized over the same performance period as the corresponding revenue 
we enter into contracts with our c i customers under which we deliver recurring cash payments to them for the capacity they commit to make available on demand 
we also generally make an additional payment when a c i customer reduces consumption of energy from the electric power grid during a demand response event 
the equipment and installation costs for our devices located at our c i customer sites  which monitor energy usage  communicate with c i customer sites and  in certain instances  remotely control energy usage to achieve committed capacity are capitalized and depreciated over the lesser of the remaining estimated customer relationship period or the estimated useful life of the equipment  and this depreciation is reflected in cost of revenues 
we also include in cost of revenues our amortization of capitalized internal use software costs related to our demandsmart application  the monthly telecommunications and data costs we incur as a result of being connected to c i customer sites and our internal payroll and related costs allocated to a c i customer site 
certain costs such as equipment depreciation and telecommunications and data costs are fixed and do not vary based on revenues recognized 
these fixed costs could impact our gross margin trends described below during interim periods 
cost of revenues for our efficiencysmart  supplysmart and carbonsmart applications and services include our amortization of capitalized internal use software costs related to those applications and services  third party services  equipment depreciation and the wages and associated benefits that we pay to our project managers for the performance of their services 
gross profit and gross margin gross profit consists of our total revenues less our cost of revenues 
our gross profit has been  and will be  affected by many factors  including a the demand for our energy management applications and services  b the selling price of our energy management applications and services  c our cost of revenues  d the way in which we manage  or are permitted to manage by the relevant electric power grid operator or utility  our portfolio of demand response capacity  e the introduction of new clean and intelligent energy management applications and services  f our demand response event performance and g our ability to open and enter new markets and regions and expand deeper into markets we already serve 
our outcomes in negotiating favorable contracts with our c i customers  as well as with our electric power grid operator and utility customers  the effective management of our portfolio of demand response capacity and our demand response event performance are the primary determinants of our gross profit and gross margin 

table of contents operating expenses operating expenses consist of selling and marketing  general and administrative  and research and development expenses 
personnel related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories 
we grew from full time employees at december  to full time employees at december  we expect to continue to hire employees to support our growth for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we incur significant up front costs associated with the expansion of the number of mw under our management  which we expect to continue for the foreseeable future 
although we expect our overall operating expenses to increase in absolute dollar terms for the foreseeable future as we grow our mw under management  further increase our headcount and expand the development of our energy management applications and services  we expect our overall annual operating expenses to decrease as a percentage of total annual revenues as we leverage our existing employee base and continue generating revenues from our energy management applications and services 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of a salaries and related personnel costs  including costs associated with share based payment awards  related to our sales and marketing organization  b commissions  c travel  lodging and other out of pocket expenses  d marketing programs such as trade shows and e other related overhead 
commissions are recorded as an expense when earned by the employee 
we expect increases in selling and marketing expenses in absolute dollar terms for the foreseeable future as we further increase the number of sales professionals and  to a lesser extent  increase our marketing activities 
we expect annual selling and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of total annual revenues as we leverage our current sales and marketing personnel 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of a salaries and related personnel costs  including costs associated with share based payment awards and bonuses  related to our executive  finance  human resource  information technology and operations organizations  b facilities expenses  c accounting and legal professional fees  d depreciation and amortization and e other related overhead 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollar terms for the foreseeable future as we invest in infrastructure to support our continued growth 
we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of total annual revenues as we leverage our current infrastructure and employee base 
however  amortization expense from intangible assets acquired in future acquisitions could potentially increase our general and administrative expenses in future periods 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of a salaries and related personnel costs  including costs associated with share based payment awards  related to our research and development organization  b payments to suppliers for design and consulting services  c costs relating to the design and development of new energy management applications and services and enhancement of existing energy management applications and services  d quality assurance and testing and e other related overhead 
during the years ended december   and  we capitalized internal software development costs of million  million and million  respectively  and the amount is included as software in property and equipment at december  we capitalized million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  related to a company wide enterprise resource planning systems implementation project 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollar terms for the foreseeable future as we develop new technologies and to decrease as a percentage of total revenues in the long term as we leverage our existing technology 

table of contents stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with accounting standards codification  or asc   stock compensation 
as such  all share based payments to employees  including grants of stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units  are recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values as of the date of grant 
for stock options granted prior to january   the fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model  and for stock options granted on or after january   the fair value of each award is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice valuation model 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded expenses of approximately million  million and million  respectively  in connection with share based payment awards to employees and non employees 
with respect to option grants through december   a future expense of non vested options of approximately million is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
with respect to restricted stock and restricted stock units issued through december   a future expense of unvested restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards of approximately million is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
other income and expense  net other income and expense consist primarily of interest income earned on cash balances  gain or loss on transactions designated in currencies other than our or our subsidiaries functional currency and other non operating income 
we historically have invested our cash in money market funds  treasury funds  commercial paper  municipal bonds and auction rate securities 
we do not currently hold any auction rate securities 
interest expense interest expense consists of interest on our capital lease obligations  fees associated with the svb credit facility  and fees associated with issuing letters of credit and other financial assurances 
consolidated results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues the following table summarizes our revenues for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands december  dollar percentage change change revenues demand response efficiencysmart  supplysmart and carbonsmart total revenues for the year ended december   our demand response revenues increased by million  or  as compared to the year ended december  the increase in our demand response revenues was 
table of contents primarily attributable to changes in our mw under management in the following existing operating areas dollars in thousands revenue increase december  to december  pjm tennessee valley authority new england new york california other total increased demand response revenues the amounts included in this category relate to increases in various demand response programs  none of which are individually material 
in addition to an increase in our mw under management  the increase in our demand response revenues for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was also attributable to the effective management of our portfolio of demand response capacity and more favorable pricing in certain operating areas 
additionally  approximately of the increase in demand response revenues was attributable to an increase in energy payment revenues due to more demand response events occurring in as compared to these increases were offset by the commencement of a new iso ne program  which started on june   under which we enrolled fewer mw with lower pricing compared to a prior  similar iso ne program in which we participated 
for the year ended december   our efficiencysmart  supplysmart and carbonsmart applications and services revenues increased by million as compared to the year ended december  primarily due to our acquisition of cogent  a company specializing in comprehensive energy consulting  engineering and building commissioning solutions to c i customers  which occurred in december we currently expect our revenues to increase slightly for the year ending december  as compared to the same period in as we further increase our mw under management in all operating regions  enroll new c i customers in our demand response programs  expand the sales of our efficiencysmart  supplysmart and carbonsmart applications and services to our new and existing c i customers and pursue more favorable pricing opportunities with our c i customers 
although we expect an increase in our mw under management in the pjm market in as compared to  until pjm prices return in to more historical levels  we expect our revenues derived from the pjm market to decrease as a percentage of total annual revenues in and as significantly lower capacity prices in this market take effect for those years 
these lower prices in pjm will negatively impact our ability to grow our overall revenues in and at levels consistent with prior years 
for example  had the lower pricing that will take effect in the pjm market beginning in been in effect during the year ended december   our revenues for that period would have been lower by approximately million to million 
in addition  the discontinuance of the ilr program by pjm beginning in will reduce the flexibility that we currently have to manage our portfolio of demand response capacity in the pjm market and will negatively impact our future revenues 
we also expect a decrease in mw enrolled in the pjm market in as compared to  which could also negatively impact our revenues in in connection with the pjm statement  in the event that ferc does not grant us declaratory relief  or agrees with the pjm statement and modifies the pjm market rules in the future to reflect the pjm statement  or to the extent pjm is otherwise successful at modifying the market rules in the future  our revenues for and beyond could be significantly reduced  currently estimated to be in the range of million to million  however  the ultimate financial impact could deviate from this range and will depend on several factors  including the details of any modified market rule or ferc ruling and the associated timing and market impact of any such rule or ruling 

table of contents gross profit and gross margin the following table summarizes our gross profit and gross margin percentages for our energy management applications and services for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  gross profit gross margin gross profit gross margin our gross profit increased during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in primarily due to the substantial increase in our revenues  as well as the effective management of our portfolio of demand response capacity and strong demand response event performance  particularly in the pjm region from which we currently derive a substantial portion of our revenues 
our gross margin decreased during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in primarily due to lower prices in the iso ne market  an increase in cost of revenues in a certain demand response program where the associated revenues were deferred and recognition of certain project start up costs related to an enterprise energy management arrangement pursuant to which revenue recognition has not yet commenced 
additionally  our gross margin decreased during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in due to increased depreciation and amortization of capitalized costs and an impairment charge of million recognized during the year ended december  related to certain demand response and back up generator equipment 
we currently expect that our gross margin for the year ending december  will be similar to our gross margin for the year ended december   and that our gross margin for the three months ending september  will be the highest gross margin among our four quarterly reporting periods in  consistent with our gross margin pattern in  due to seasonality related to the demand response market 
in addition  until the prices in the pjm market improve in  we expect the lower capacity prices that will take effect in the pjm market in and to negatively impact our ability to grow our overall gross profits and gross margins in and at levels consistent with prior years 
moreover  the discontinuance of the ilr program by pjm beginning in will reduce the flexibility that we currently have to manage our portfolio of demand response capacity in the pjm market and will negatively impact our future gross profits and gross margins 
we also expect a decrease in mw enrolled in the pjm market in as compared to  which could also negatively impact our gross profits and gross margins in in connection with the pjm statement  in the event that ferc does not grant us declaratory relief  or agrees with the pjm statement and modifies the pjm market rules in the future to reflect the pjm statement  or to the extent pjm is otherwise successful at modifying the market rules in the future  our gross profits for and beyond could be further reduced and our gross margins for the same period could be negatively impacted 
operating expenses the following table summarizes our operating expenses for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  percentage change operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative research and development total in certain forward capacity markets in which we choose to participate  such as pjm  we may enable our c i customers  meaning we may install our equipment at a c i customer site to allow for the curtailment of 
table of contents mw from the electric power grid  up to twelve months in advance of enrolling the c i customer in a particular program 
this market feature creates a longer average revenue recognition lag time across our c i customer portfolio from the point in time when we consider a mw to be under management to when we earn revenues from that mw 
because we incur operational expenses  including salaries and related personnel costs  at the time of enablement  there has been a trend of incurring operating expenses associated with enabling our c i customers in advance of recognizing the corresponding revenues

table of contents increase in stock based compensation for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily due to stock based compensation expenses associated with our current and former chief financial officer and other officers and directors  including the costs related to accelerating the vesting of a certain portion of our former chief financial officer s options to purchase shares of our common stock

other income  net other income for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in other income for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was primarily due to the global decrease in interest rates  which affected the yields on our investments and  to a lesser extent  lower average investment balances and the recognition of net foreign currency transactions 
interest expense interest expense for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
interest expense includes interest on our outstanding debt  letters of credit origination fees  and amortization of deferred financing fees 
the increase in interest expense for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was due to a million increase in fees associated with outstanding letters of credit  primarily attributable to the arrangement that we entered into with a third party in may in connection with bidding capacity into a certain open market bidding program 
this was offset by a million decrease in fees associated with our outstanding debt due to the replacement of our debt facility with bluecrest capital finance  lp  or bluecrest  with the svb credit facility  which occurred in august income taxes we had a provision for income taxes of million for each of the years ended december  and  which primarily related to the amortization of tax deductible goodwill that generated a deferred tax liability that cannot be offset by net operating losses or other deferred tax assets since its reversal is considered 
table of contents indefinite in nature 
we provided a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets because the realization of any future tax benefits could not be sufficiently assured as of december  and liquidity and capital resources overview since inception  we have generated significant cumulative losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
as of december   our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents totaling million  an increase of million from the december  balance of million 
as of december   we were contingently liable for million in connection with outstanding letters of credit under the svb credit facility 
as of december  and  we had restricted cash balances of million and million  respectively  which relate to amounts to collateralize unused outstanding letters of credit and cover financial assurance requirements in certain of the programs in which we participate 
at december  and december   our excess cash was primarily invested in money market funds 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents at december  and our anticipated net cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs  including investing activities  for at least the next months 
our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  without limitation  the rate at which we sell certain of our energy management applications and services to electric power grid operators and utilities and the increasing rate at which letters of credit or security deposits are required by those electric power grid operators and utilities  the introduction and market acceptance of new energy management applications and services  the expansion of our sales and marketing and research and development activities  and the geographic expansion of our business operations 
to the extent that our cash and cash equivalents and our anticipated cash flows from operating activities are insufficient to fund our future activities or planned future acquisitions  we may be required to raise additional funds through bank credit arrangements  including the potential expansion  renewal or replacement of the svb credit facility  or public or private equity or debt financings 
we also may raise additional funds in the event we determine in the future to effect one or more acquisitions of businesses  technologies or products 
in addition  we may elect to raise additional funds even before we need them if the conditions for raising capital are favorable 
accordingly  we have filed a shelf registration statement with the sec to register shares of our common stock and other securities for sale  giving us the opportunity to raise funding when needed or otherwise considered appropriate at prices and on terms to be determined at the time of any such offerings 
we currently have the ability to sell approximately million of our securities under the shelf registration statement 
any equity or equity linked financing could be dilutive to existing stockholders 
in the event we require additional cash resources  we may not be able to obtain bank credit arrangements or effect any equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 
if we fail to extend or renew the svb credit facility and we still have letters of credit issued and outstanding under the svb credit facility when it matures on march   we will be required to post of the value of the letters of credit in cash with svb to collateralize those letters of credit

additional information non gaap financial measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis  we disclose certain non gaap measures that exclude certain amounts  including non gaap net income loss  non gaap net income loss per share  adjusted ebitda and free cash flow 
these non gaap measures are not in accordance with  or an alternative for  generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the gaap measure most comparable to non gaap net income loss is gaap net income loss  the gaap measure most comparable to non gaap net income loss per share is gaap net income loss per share  the gaap measure most comparable to adjusted ebitda is gaap net income loss  and the gaap measure most comparable to free cash flow is cash flows from operating activities 
reconciliations of each of these non gaap financial measures to the corresponding gaap measure are included below 
use and economic substance of non gaap financial measures used by enernoc management uses these non gaap measures when evaluating our operating performance and for internal planning and forecasting purposes 
management believes that such measures help indicate underlying trends in our business  are important in comparing current results with prior period results  and are useful to investors and financial analysts in assessing our operating performance 
for example  management considers non gaap 
table of contents net income loss to be an important indicator of the overall performance because it eliminates the effects of events that are either not part of our core operations or are non cash compensation expenses 
in addition  management considers adjusted ebitda to be an important indicator of our operational strength and performance of our business and a good measure of our historical operating trend 
moreover  management considers free cash flow to be an indicator of our operating trend and performance of our business 
the following is an explanation of the non gaap measures that we utilize  including the adjustments that management excluded as part of the non gaap measures for the years ended december   and  respectively  as well as reasons for excluding these individual items management defines non gaap net income loss as net income loss before expenses related to stock based compensation and amortization expenses related to acquisition related intangible assets  net of related tax effects 
management defines adjusted ebitda as net income loss  excluding depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation  interest  income taxes and other income expense 
adjusted ebitda eliminates items that are either not part of our core operations or do not require a cash outlay  such as stock based compensation 
adjusted ebitda also excludes depreciation and amortization expense  which is based on our estimate of the useful life of tangible and intangible assets 
these estimates could vary from actual performance of the asset  are based on historic cost incurred to build out our deployed network and may not be indicative of current or future capital expenditures 
management defines free cash flow as net cash provided by used in operating activities less capital expenditures 
management defines capital expenditures as purchases of property and equipment  which includes capitalization of internal use software development costs 
material limitations associated with the use of non gaap financial measures non gaap net income loss  non gaap net income loss per share  adjusted ebitda and free cash flow may have limitations as analytical tools 
the non gaap financial information presented here should be considered in conjunction with  and not as a substitute for or superior to  the financial information presented in accordance with gaap and should not be considered measures of our liquidity 
there are significant limitations associated with the use of non gaap financial measures 
further  these measures may differ from the non gaap information  even where similarly titled  used by other companies and therefore should not be used to compare our performance to that of other companies

the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuations and purchase price allocations related to business combinations  expected future cash flows including growth rates  discount rates  terminal values and other assumptions and estimates used to evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill  estimated fair values of intangible assets and goodwill  amortization methods and periods  certain accrued expenses and other related charges  stock based compensation  contingent liabilities  tax reserves and recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
any differences could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in appendix a to this annual report on form k  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with asc  revenue recognition formerly staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in all of our arrangements  we do not recognize any revenues until persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and we deem collection to be reasonably assured 
in making these judgments  we evaluate these criteria as follows evidence of an arrangement 
we consider a definitive agreement signed by the customer and us or an arrangement enforceable under the rules of an open market bidding program to be representative of persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
we consider delivery to have occurred when service has been delivered to the customer and no post delivery obligations exist 
in instances where customer acceptance is required  delivery is deemed to have occurred when customer acceptance has been achieved 
fees are fixed or determinable 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable unless the fee is subject to refund or adjustment or is not payable within normal payment terms 
if the fee is subject to refund or adjustment and we cannot reliably estimate this amount  we recognize revenues when the right to a refund or adjustment lapses 
if offered payment terms significantly exceed our normal terms  we recognize revenues as the amounts become due and payable or upon the receipt of cash 
collection is reasonably assured 
we conduct a credit review at the inception of an arrangement to determine the creditworthiness of the customer 
collection is reasonably assured if  based upon our evaluation  we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  revenues are deferred and recognized upon the receipt of cash 
we enter into utility contracts and open market bidding programs to provide demand response applications and services 
demand response revenues consist of two elements revenue earned based on our ability to deliver committed capacity to our electric power grid operator and utility customers  which we refer to as capacity revenue  and revenue earned based on additional payments made to us for the amount of energy usage actually curtailed from the grid during a demand response event  which we refer to as energy event revenue 
we recognize demand response revenue when we have provided verification to the electric power grid operator or utility of our ability to deliver the committed capacity which entitles us to payments under the utility contract or open market program 
committed capacity is generally verified through the results of an actual demand response event or a measurement and verification test 
once the capacity amount has been verified  the revenue is recognized and future revenue becomes fixed or determinable and is recognized monthly until the next demand response event or test 
in subsequent verification events  if our verified capacity is below the previously verified amount  the electric power grid operator or utility customer will reduce future payments based on the adjusted verified capacity amounts 
ongoing demand response revenue recognized between demand response events or tests that are not subject to penalty or customer refund are recognized in revenue 
if the revenue is subject to refund and the amount of refund cannot be reliably estimated  the revenue is deferred until the right of refund lapses 
certain of the forward capacity programs in which we participate may be deemed derivative contracts under asc  derivatives and hedging formerly sfas no 
 accounting for derivative and hedging activities 
in such situations  we believe we meet the scope exception under asc as a normal purchase  normal sale as that term is defined in asc and  accordingly  the arrangement is not treated as a derivative contract 
revenue from energy events is recognized when earned 
energy event revenue is deemed to be substantive and represents the culmination of a separate earnings process and is recognized when the energy 
table of contents event is initiated by the electric power grid operator or utility customer and we have responded under the terms of the utility contract or open market program 
as described above  utility contracts or open market programs may include performance guarantees 
if we are unable to reliably estimate our ability to meet these guarantees  we do not recognize any revenue prior to the successful completion of the performance requirement 
in addition to demand response and energy event revenues  we generally receive either a subscription based fee  consulting fee or a percentage savings fee for arrangements under which we provide our efficiencysmart  supplysmart and carbonsmart applications and services 
we generally recognize these revenues over the service delivery period as the services are delivered 
if the revenue is subject to refund and the amount of refund cannot be reliably estimated  the revenue is deferred until the right of refund lapses 
business combinations we record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations under the purchase method of accounting 
amounts paid for each acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition 
the fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management 
we estimate the fair value of contingent consideration at the time of the acquisition using all pertinent information known to us at the time to assess the probability of payment of contingent amounts 
we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill 
we use the income approach to determine the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets  including customer contracts  customer relationships  non compete agreements and trade names 
this approach determines fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to an in process project over its useful life and then discounting these after tax cash flows back to a present value 
we base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes  expected market growth rates and expected trends  including introductions by competitors of new services and products 
we base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and market participant investment risk factors 
the use of different assumptions could materially impact the purchase price allocation and our financial condition and results of operations 
customer contracts represent contractual arrangements to provide ongoing energy management applications and services 
customer relationships represent established relationships with customers  which provide a ready channel for the sale of additional energy management applications and services 
non compete agreements represent arrangements with certain employees that limit or prevent their ability to take employment at a competitor for a fixed period of time 
tradenames represent acquired product names that we intend to continue to utilize 
we have also utilized the cost approach to determine the estimated fair value of acquired indefinite lived intangible assets related to acquired in process research and development given the stage of development as of the acquisition date and the lack of sufficient information regarding future expected cash flows 
the cost approach calculates fair value by calculating the reproduction cost of an exact replica of the subject intangible asset 
we calculate the replacement cost based on actual development costs incurred through the date of acquisition 
in determining the appropriate valuation methodology  we consider  among other factors the in process projects stage of completion  the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date  the costs already incurred  the projected costs to complete  the expected introduction date  and the estimated useful life of the technology 
we believe that the estimated in process research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects 

table of contents impairment of intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets we amortize our intangible assets that have finite lives using either the straight line method or  if reliably determinable  based on the pattern in which the economic benefit of the asset is expected to be consumed utilizing expected undiscounted future cash flows 
amortization is recorded over the estimated useful lives ranging from one to ten years 
we review our intangible assets subject to amortization to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life 
if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its undiscounted cash flows  we will write down the carrying value of the intangible asset to its fair value in the period identified 
in assessing recoverability  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and discount rates 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
we generally calculate fair value as the present value of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset using a risk adjusted discount rate 
if the estimate of an intangible asset s remaining useful life is changed  we will amortize the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset prospectively over the revised remaining useful life 
during the year ended december   as a result of a change in the expected period of economic benefit of the trade name acquired in the acquisition of cogent  we determined that an impairment indicator existed 
based on the analysis performed  we determined that this trade name was partially impaired and recorded an impairment charge of  during the year ended december   which is included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the fair market value of approximately  was determined using level inputs  as defined by asc  fair value measurements and disclosures formerly sfas no 
 fair value measurement  based on the projected future cash flows over the revised period of economic benefit discounted based on our weighted average cost of capital of 
goodwill in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other formerly fasb sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
we have determined that the reporting unit level is the entity level as discrete financial information is not available at a lower level and our chief operating decision maker  which is our chief executive officer and executive management team  collectively  make business decisions based on the evaluation of financial information at the entity level 
events that would indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment include  but are not limited to  current economic and market conditions  including a decline in market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors  business climate or operational performance of the business  and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
our annual impairment test date is november in performing the test  we utilize the two step approach prescribed under asc the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units  as defined  to the fair value of these units 
we consider a number of factors to determine the fair value of a reporting unit  including an independent valuation to conduct this test 
the valuation is based upon expected future discounted operating cash flows of the reporting unit as well as analysis of recent sales or offerings of similar companies 
we base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as the date of the impairment test on our weighted average cost of capital 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we will perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
we conducted our annual impairment test as of november  in order to complete the annual impairment test  we performed detailed analyses estimating the fair value of our reporting unit utilizing our forecast for the fiscal year ending december  with updated long term growth assumptions 
as a result of completing the first step  the fair value exceeded the carrying value  and as such the second step of the 
table of contents impairment test was not required 
to date  we have not been required to perform the second step of the impairment test 
the fair value of the entity is determined by use of a market approach based on the quoted market price of our common stock and the number of shares outstanding 
we believe that we are not at risk of failing the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
the estimate of fair value requires significant judgment 
any loss resulting from an impairment test would be reflected in operating loss in our consolidated statements of operations 
the annual impairment testing process is subjective and requires judgment at many points throughout the analysis 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
impairment of property and equipment we review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
if these assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment is recognized in earnings and equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
if these assets are not impaired  but their useful lives have decreased  the remaining net book value is amortized over the revised useful life 
during the three months ended december   we identified a potential impairment indicator related to certain demand response and back up generator equipment as a result of lower than estimated demand response event performance by these assets 
as a result of this potential indicator of impairment  we performed an impairment test during the three months ended december  the applicable long lived assets were measured for impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows were largely independent of the cash flows of other assets or liabilities 
we determined that the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset group over its remaining estimated useful life would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset group 
we determined the fair value of the asset group using a discounted cash flow technique based on level inputs  as defined by asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  or asc  and a discount rate of  which we determined represents a market rate of return for the assets being evaluated for impairment 
we determined that the fair value of the asset group was million compared to the carrying value of the asset group of million  and as a result recorded an impairment charge of million during the three months ended december   which is reflected in cost of revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the impairment charge was allocated to the individual assets within the asset group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets 
during the three months ended september   we identified an impairment indicator related to certain demand response equipment as a result of lower than estimated demand response event performance in certain demand response programs and the removal of demand response equipment from service during the three months ended september  as a result of this impairment indicator  we performed an impairment test during the three months ended september  and recognized an impairment charge of million during the three months ended september   representing the difference between the carrying value and fair market value of the demand response equipment  which is included in cost of revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the fair market value was determined utilizing level inputs  as defined by asc  based on the projected future cash flows discounted using the estimated market participant rate of return for this type of asset 
during the three months ended june   we identified an impairment indicator related to certain demand response and back up generator equipment as a result of lower than estimated demand response event performance by these assets 
the applicable long lived assets were measured for impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows were largely independent of the cash flows of other assets or liabilities 
we determined that the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset group over its remaining estimated useful life would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset group 
we determined the fair value of the asset group using a discounted cash flow technique based on level inputs  as defined by 
table of contents asc  and a discount rate of  which we determined to represent a market rate of return for the assets being evaluated for impairment 
we determined that the fair value of the asset group was million compared to the carrying value of the asset group of million  and as a result recorded an impairment charge of million during the three months ended june   which is reflected in cost of revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the impairment charge was allocated to the individual assets within the asset group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets 
for the year ended december   the carrying value of a portion of our demand response and generation equipment exceeded the undiscounted future cash flows based upon the anticipated retirement dates 
as a result  we recognized an impairment charge of million representing the difference between the carrying value and fair market value of demand response and generation equipment  which is included in cost of revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the fair market value of approximately million was determined utilizing level inputs  as defined by asc  based on the projected future cash flows discounted using the estimated market participant rate of return for this type of asset 
we recognized an impairment charge of million for the year ended december   which is included in cost of revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   approximately million of our generation equipment was utilized in open market demand response programs 
the recoverability of this generation equipments carrying value is largely dependent on the rates that we are compensated for its committed capacity within these programs 
these rates represent market rates and can fluctuate based on the supply and demand of capacity 
although these market rates are established up to three years in advance of the service delivery  these market rates have not yet been established for the entire remaining useful life of this generation equipment 
in performing the relevant impairment analysis  we estimate the expected future market rates based on current existing market rates and trends 
a decline in the expected future market rates of greater than could result in an impairment charge related to this generation equipment 
software development costs we capitalize eligible costs associated with software developed or obtained for internal use 
we capitalize the payroll and payroll related costs of employees who devote time to the development of internal use computer software 
we amortize these costs on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the software  which is generally two to three years 
our judgment is required in determining the point at which various projects enter the stages at which costs may be capitalized  in assessing the ongoing value and impairment of the capitalized costs  and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized 
software development costs of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  have been capitalized 
we capitalized million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  related to a company wide enterprise resource planning systems implementation project 
stock based compensation our amended and restated stock option and incentive plan  which we refer to as the plan  and our amended and restated employee  director and consultant stock plan  which we refer to as the plan  provide for the grant of incentive stock options  nonqualified stock options  restricted and unrestricted stock awards and other stock based awards to our eligible employees  directors and consultants 
options granted under both the plan and the plan are exercisable for a period determined by us  but in no event longer than ten years from the date of the grant 
option awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
options  restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards generally vest ratably over four years  with certain exceptions 
the plan expired upon our ipo in may any forfeitures under the plan that occurred after the effective date of the ipo are available for future grant under the plan up to a maximum of  shares 
during the years ended december  and  we issued  shares of our common stock and  shares of our common stock  respectively  to certain executives to satisfy a portion 
table of contents of our compensation obligations to those individuals 
as of december    shares were available for future grant under the plan 
for stock options granted prior to january   the fair value of each option was estimated at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
for stock options granted on or after january   the fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice valuation model 
the lattice model considers characteristics of fair value option pricing that are not available under the black scholes model 
similar to the black scholes model  the lattice model takes into account variables such as expected volatility  dividend yield rate  and risk free interest rate 
however  in addition  the lattice model considers the probability that the option will be exercised prior to the end of its contractual life and the probability of termination or retirement of the option holder in computing the value of the option 
for these reasons  we believe that the lattice model provides a fair value that is more representative of actual experience and future expected experience than the value calculated using the black scholes model 
volatility measures the amount that a stock price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate during a period 
as there was no public market for our common stock prior to the effective date of the ipo  we determined volatility based on an analysis of reported data for a peer group of companies that issued options with substantially similar terms 
the expected volatility of options granted has been determined using an average of the historical volatility measures of this peer group of companies  as well as the historical volatility of our common stock beginning january  during the three months ended september   we determined that we had sufficient history to utilize company specific volatility in accordance with asc  stock compensation  or asc  and we are now calculating volatility using a component of implied volatility and historical volatility to determine the value of share based payments 
the risk free interest rate is the rate available as of the option date on zero coupon united states government issues with a term equal to the expected life of the option 
we have not paid dividends on our common stock in the past and do not plan to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future 
in addition  the terms of the svb credit facility preclude us from paying dividends 
during the year ended december   we updated our estimated exit rate pre vesting and post vesting applied to options  restricted stock and restricted stock units based on an evaluation of demographics of our employee groups and historical forfeitures for these groups in order to determine our option valuations as well as our stock based compensation expense 
the changes in estimate of the volatility  exit rate pre vesting and exit rate post vesting did not have a material impact on our stock based compensation expense recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option 
we have determined a forfeiture rate of as of december  ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded expenses of approximately million  million and million  respectively  in connection with share based payment awards to employees and non employees 
with respect to grants through december   a future expense of non vested options of approximately million is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years and a future expense of restricted stock and restricted stock units of approximately million is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
for awards with graded vesting  we allocate compensation costs on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
accordingly  we amortized the fair value of each option over each option s service period  which is generally the vesting period 
our accounting for stock options issued to non employees requires valuing and remeasuring such stock options to the current fair value until the performance date has been reached 
stock based compensation expense recorded for the years ended december   and related to stock options to non employees was not material 

table of contents accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between financial reporting and taxes bases of our assets and liabilities 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse 
we have incurred consolidated net losses since our inception and as a result  we had not recognized net united states deferred taxes as of december  or december  our deferred tax liabilities primarily relate to deferred taxes associated with our acquisitions and property and equipment 
our deferred tax assets relate primarily to net operating loss carryforwards  accruals and reserves  and stock based compensation 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
in accordance with asc  income taxes  we are required to evaluate uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements formerly fasb interpretation no 
 or fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 

asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement criteria for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
asc also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition and defines the criteria that must be met for the benefits of a tax position to be recognized 
we had no unrecognized tax benefits as of december  and in the ordinary course of global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
in our opinion  it is not required that we have a provision for income taxes for any years subject to audit 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
in the event our assumptions are incorrect  the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb ratified asc update no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu asu amends existing revenue recognition accounting pronouncements that are currently within the scope of asc subtopic previously included within eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf 
asu provides for two significant changes to the existing multiple element revenue recognition guidance 
first  asu deletes the requirement to have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for undelivered elements in an arrangement and will result in more deliverables being treated as separate units of accounting 
the second change modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables 
these changes may result in entities recognizing more revenue up front  and entities will no longer be able to apply the residual method and defer the fair value of undelivered elements 
upon adoption of asu  each separate unit of accounting must have a selling price  which can be based on management s estimate when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item  and the arrangement consideration is allocated based on the elements relative selling price 
entities may elect to adopt asu either through prospective application to all revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after the date of adoption or through a retrospective application to all revenue arrangements for all periods presented in the financial statements 
we will adopt asu on a prospective basis for all revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after january  we do not expect that the adoption of asu will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

table of contents in january  the fasb issued asu  improving disclosure about fair value measurements  or asu asu requires additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements  amends disclosures about post retirement benefit plan assets and provides clarification regarding the level of disaggregation of fair value disclosures by investment class 
asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for certain level activity disclosure requirements that are effective for reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments asc  financial instruments formerly sfas no 
 disclosure of fair value of financial instruments  requires disclosure about fair value of financial instruments 
financial instruments principally consist of cash equivalents  marketable securities  accounts receivable  and debt obligations 
the fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying amount 
foreign exchange risk our international business is subject to risks  including  but not limited to unique economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
we maintain sales and service offices outside the united states 
the expenses of our international offices are denominated in local currencies 
in addition  our foreign sales are denominated in local currencies 
fluctuations in the foreign currency rates could affect our sales  cost of revenues and profit margins and could 
table of contents result in exchange losses 
in addition  currency devaluations can result in a loss if we hold deposits of that currency 
we believe that the operating expenses of our international subsidiaries that are incurred in local currencies will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our operating results and certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are affected by changes in the relative strength of the us dollar against the applicable foreign currency 
our expenses denominated in foreign currencies are positively affected when the us dollar strengthens against the applicable foreign currency and adversely affected when the us dollar weakens 
however  we believe that the foreign currency exchange risk is not significant 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in foreign currencies that we transact in would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
during the years ended december   and  we incurred foreign exchange losses of   and  respectively 
interest rate risk as of december   we had no outstanding debt under the svb credit facility 
this is a result of repaying our outstanding borrowings of approximately million under the svb credit facility during the fourth quarter of the recent market events have not required us to materially modify or change our financial risk management strategies with respect to our exposure to interest rate risk 
we manage our cash and cash equivalents portfolio considering investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
our investment portfolio consists primarily of cash and cash equivalents  money market funds  and commercial paper 
we have  in the past  held municipal auction rate securities that have since been redeemed 
as our investments are made with highly rated securities  we are not anticipating any significant impact in the short term from a change in interest rates
