the following discussion may contain forward looking statements  and our actual results may differ significantly from the results suggested by these forward looking statements 
some factors that may cause our results to differ materially from the results and events anticipated or implied by such forward looking statements are described in item a risk factors 
overview we are a leading global fuel logistics company  principally engaged in the marketing  sale and distribution of aviation  marine  and land fuel products and related services on a worldwide basis 
we compete by providing our customers value added benefits  including single supplier convenience  competitive pricing  the availability of trade credit  price risk management  logistical support  fuel quality control and fuel procurement outsourcing 
we have three reportable operating business segments aviation  marine  and land 
we primarily contract with third parties for the delivery and storage of fuel products and in some cases own storage and transportation assets for strategic purposes 
in our aviation segment  we offer fuel and related services to major commercial airlines  second and third tier airlines  cargo carriers  regional and low cost carriers  fixed based operators  corporate fleets  fractional operators  private aircraft  military fleets and to the us and foreign governments  and we also offer card processing services in connection with the purchase of aviation fuel and related services 
in our marine segment  we offer fuel and related services to a broad base of marine customers  including international container and tanker fleets  commercial cruise lines and time charter operators  as well as to the us and foreign governments 
in our land segment  we offer fuel and related services to petroleum distributors operating in the land transportation market  retail petroleum operators  and industrial  commercial and government customers 
additionally  we also operate a small number of retail gas stations in the us in our aviation and land segments  we primarily purchase and resell fuel  and we do not act as brokers 
profit from our aviation and land segments is primarily determined by the volume and the gross profit achieved on fuel resales  and in the case of the aviation segment  a percentage of processed charge card revenue 
in our marine 
table of contents segment  we primarily purchase and resell fuel and also act as brokers for others 
profit from our marine segment is determined primarily by the volume and gross profit achieved on fuel resales and by the volume and commission rate of the brokering business 
our profitability in our segments also depends on our operating expenses  which may be significantly affected to the extent that we are required to provide for potential bad debt 
our revenue and cost of revenue are significantly impacted by world oil prices  as evidenced in part by our revenue and cost of revenue fluctuations in recent fiscal years  while our gross profit is not necessarily impacted by changes in world oil prices 
however  due to our inventory average costing methodology  significant movements in fuel prices during any given financial period can have a significant impact on our gross profit  either positively or negatively depending on the direction  volatility and timing of such price movements 
we may experience decreases in future sales volumes and margins as a result of the ongoing deterioration in the world economy  transportation industry  natural disasters and continued conflicts and instability in the middle east  asia and latin america  as well as potential future terrorist activities and possible military retaliation 
in addition  because fuel costs represent a significant part of our customers operating expenses  volatile and or high fuel prices can adversely affect our customers businesses  and consequently the demand for our services and our results of operations 
our hedging activities may not be effective to mitigate volatile fuel prices and may expose us to counterparty risk 
see item a risk factors of this form k 
reportable segments we have three reportable operating segments aviation  marine and land 
corporate expenses are allocated to the segment based on usage  where possible  or on other factors according to the nature of the activity 
we evaluate and manage our business segments using the performance measurement of income from operations 
financial information with respect to our business segments is provided in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to unbilled revenue and related costs of sales  bad debt  share based payment awards  derivatives  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets and certain accrued liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other significant accounting policies  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of fuel is recognized when the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured and title passes to the customer  which is when the delivery of fuel is made to our customer directly from us  the supplier or a third party subcontractor 
our fuel sales are generated as a fuel reseller as well as from on hand inventory supply 
when acting as a fuel reseller  we generally purchase fuel from the supplier  mark it up and contemporaneously resell the fuel to the customer  normally taking delivery for purchased fuel at the same 
table of contents place and time as the delivery is made to the customer 
we record the gross sale of the fuel as we generally take inventory risk  have latitude in establishing the sales price  have discretion in the supplier selection  maintain credit risk and are the primary obligor in the sales arrangement 
revenue from fuel related services is recognized when services are performed  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we record the sale of fuel related services on a gross basis as we generally have latitude in establishing the sales price  have discretion in supplier selection  maintain credit risk and are the primary obligor in the sales arrangement 
commission from fuel broker services is recognized when services are performed and collectability is reasonably assured 
when acting as a fuel broker  we are paid a commission by the supplier 
revenue from charge card transactions is recognized at the time the purchase is made by the customer using the charge card 
revenue from charge card transactions is generated from processing fees 
share based payment awards we account for share based payment awards on a fair value basis 
under fair value accounting  the grant date fair value of the share based payment award is amortized as compensation expense  on a straight line basis  over the vesting period for both graded and cliff vesting awards 
annual compensation expense for share based payment awards is reduced by an expected forfeiture amount on the outstanding share based payment awards 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of option awards 
the estimation of the fair value of option awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rates and expected dividends 
the expected term of option awards represents the estimated period of time from grant until exercise or conversion and is based on vesting schedules and expected post vesting  exercise and employment termination behavior 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the period that is equivalent to the award s expected life 
any adjustment to the historical volatility as an indicator of future volatility would be based on the impact to historical volatility of significant non recurring events that would not be expected in the future 
risk free interest rates are based on the us treasury yield curve at the time of grant for the period that is equivalent to the award s expected life 
dividend yields are based on the historical dividends of world fuel over the period that is equivalent to the award s expected life  as adjusted for stock splits 
the estimated fair value of common stock  restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the grant date market value of our common stock  as defined in the respective plans under which the awards were granted 
cash flows from tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for share based payment awards excess tax benefits are classified as financing cash flows 
these excess income tax benefits were credited to capital in excess of par value 
accounts receivable and allowance for bad debt credit extension  monitoring and collection are performed for each of our business segments 
each segment has a credit committee that is responsible for approving credit limits  setting and maintaining credit standards and managing the overall quality of the credit portfolio 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon a customer s payment history and creditworthiness  as determined by our review of our customer s credit information 
we extend credit on an unsecured basis to most of our customers 
accounts receivable are deemed past due based on contractual terms agreed with our customers 

table of contents we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience with our customers  current market and industry conditions affecting our customers and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
historical payment trends may not be a useful indicator of current or future credit worthiness of our customers  particularly in these unprecedented difficult economic and financial markets 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for estimated credit losses 
if credit losses exceed established allowances  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
for additional information on the credit risks inherent in our business  see item a risk factors of this form k 
inventories inventories are valued using the average cost methodology and are stated at the lower of average cost or market 
components of inventory include fuel purchase costs  the related transportation costs  storage fees  and for inventories included in a fair value hedge relationship  changes in the estimated fair market values 
derivatives we enter into financial derivative contracts in order to mitigate the risk of market price fluctuations in aviation  marine and land fuel  to offer our customers fuel pricing alternatives to meet their needs and to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we also enter into proprietary derivative transactions  primarily intended to capitalize on arbitrage opportunities related to basis or time spreads related to fuel products we sell 
we have applied the normal purchase and normal sales exception npns  as provided by accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities  to certain of our physical forward sales and purchase contracts 
while these contracts are considered derivative instruments under the guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities  they are not recorded at fair value  but rather are recorded in our consolidated financial statements when physical settlement of the contracts occurs 
if it is determined that a transaction designated as npns no longer meets the scope of the exception  the fair value of the related contract is recorded as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheet and the difference between the fair value and the contract amount is immediately recognized through earnings 
our derivatives that are subject to the accounting guidance for derivative instruments are recognized at their estimated fair market value in accordance with the accounting guidance for fair value measurements 
if the derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge  changes in the estimated fair market value of the derivative are recognized as a component of revenue or cost of revenue based on the underlying transaction type in the consolidated statement of income 
derivatives which qualify for hedge accounting may be designated as either a fair value or cash flow hedge 
for our fair value hedges  changes in the estimated fair market value of the hedge instrument and the hedged item are recognized in the same line item as a component of either revenue or cost of revenue based on the underlying transaction type in the consolidated statement of income 
for our cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the changes in the fair market value of the hedge is recognized as a component of other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheet and subsequently reclassified into the same line item as the forecasted transaction when both are settled  while the ineffective portion of the changes in the estimated fair market value of the hedge is recognized as a component of other non operating expense income in the consolidated statement of income 
cash flows for our hedging instruments used in our hedges are classified in the same category as the cash flow from the hedged items 
if for any reason hedge accounting is discontinued  then any cash flows subsequent to the date of discontinuance shall be classified consistent with the nature of the instrument 
to qualify for hedge accounting  as either a fair value or cash flow hedge  the hedging relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items must be highly effective over an extended period of time in achieving the offset of changes in fair values or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk at the inception of the hedge 
we use a regression analysis based on historical spot prices in assessing the qualification for our fair value hedges 
however  
table of contents our measurement of hedge ineffectiveness for our fair value inventory hedges utilizes spot prices for the hedged item inventory and forward or future prices for the hedge instrument 
therefore  the excluded component forward or futures prices in assessing hedge qualification  along with ineffectiveness  is included as a component of cost of revenue in earnings 
adjustments to the carrying amounts of hedged items is discontinued in instances where the related fair value hedging instrument becomes ineffective and any previously recorded fair market value changes are not adjusted until the fuel is sold 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets goodwill represents the future earnings and cash flow potential of acquired businesses in excess of the fair values that are assigned to all other identifiable assets and liabilities 
goodwill arises because the purchase price paid reflects numerous factors  including the strategic fit and expected synergies these acquisitions bring to existing operations and the prevailing market value for comparable companies 
goodwill is not subject to periodic amortization  instead  it is reviewed annually at year end or more frequently under certain circumstances for impairment 
the initial step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit  which is the same as our reporting segments  with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value of our reporting segments is estimated using discounted cash flows and market capitalization methodologies 
in connection with our acquisitions  we recorded identifiable intangible assets existing at the date of the acquisitions for customer relationships  supplier and non compete agreements and trademark trade name rights 
identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization are amortized over their estimated lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on market factors and operational considerations 
identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are reviewed annually for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
extinguishment of liability in the normal course of business  we accrue liabilities for fuel and services received for which invoices have not yet been received 
these liabilities are derecognized  or extinguished  if either payment is made to relieve our obligation for the liability or we are legally released from our obligation for the liability  such as when our legal obligations with respect to such liabilities lapse or otherwise no longer exist 
during  we derecognized vendor liability accruals due to the legal release of our obligations in the amount of million  as compared to million during  which is reflected as a reduction of cost of revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of income

our credit facility contains certain financial covenants with which we are required to comply 
our failure to comply with the financial covenants contained in our credit facility could result in an event of default 
an event of default  if not cured or waived  would permit acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility  trigger cross defaults under other agreements to which we are a party and impair our ability to obtain working capital advances and letters of credit  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

short term debt 
as of december   our short term debt of million represents the current maturities within the next twelve months of certain promissory notes related to acquisitions  loans payable to noncontrolling shareholders of a consolidated subsidiary and capital lease obligations 
we believe that available funds from existing cash and cash equivalents and our credit facility  together with cash flows generated by operations  remain sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
in addition  to further enhance our liquidity profile  we may choose to raise additional funds which may or may not be needed for additional working capital  capital expenditures or other strategic investments
