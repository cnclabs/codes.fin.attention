item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future results 
we attempt to minimize our foreign currency risk by converting our excess foreign currency held in foreign jurisdictions to us dollar denominated cash and investment accounts 
to date  we have not hedged the risks associated with foreign currency exchange exposure 
although we may do so in the future  we cannot be sure that any hedging techniques will be successful or that our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows will not be materially adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations 
as of december  and  a adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates versus the us dollar would have decreased our aggregate reported cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and investments by and  respectively 
the increase in exposure as of december  was primarily due to our increase of cash balances in non us dollar based bank accounts 
if average exchange rates in had changed unfavorably by  as compared to the prior year  our revenues for the year ended december  would have decreased 
during the year ended december   our revenues decreased as a result of a unfavorable change in average exchange rates  as compared to the prior year
