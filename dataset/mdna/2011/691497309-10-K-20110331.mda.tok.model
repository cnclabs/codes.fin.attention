table of contents part i item business business and products overview we are an international apparel design  sourcing and marketing company featuring a diverse portfolio of owned lifestyle brands  featuring tommy bahama  lilly pulitzer and ben sherman  as well as owned and licensed brands of tailored clothing and golf apparel 
we distribute our owned lifestyle branded products through a variety of upscale department stores and specialty stores as well as company owned retail stores and e commerce websites 
additionally  we operate tommy bahama restaurants  which are generally adjacent to certain of our tommy bahama retail stores 
our branded and private label tailored clothing products are distributed through department stores  specialty stores  national chains  specialty catalogs  mass merchants and internet retailers 
originally founded in  we have undergone a transformation as we migrated from our historical domestic manufacturing roots towards a focus on designing  sourcing and marketing apparel products bearing prominent trademarks owned by us 
during fiscal  approximately of our net sales  excluding sales of our discontinued operations  were from products bearing brands that we own 
we anticipate that this percentage will increase in the future with our acquisition of sugartown worldwide  inc  or sugartown  which owns the lilly pulitzer brand and operations  in december and as we continue to develop our owned brands 
a key component of our business strategy is to develop and market compelling lifestyle brands and products that are fashion right and evoke a strong emotional response from our target consumers 
as part of this strategy  we strive to exploit the potential of our existing brands and products domestically and internationally and  as suitable opportunities arise  to acquire additional lifestyle brands that we believe fit within our business model 
we consider lifestyle brands to be those brands that have a clearly defined and targeted point of view inspired by an appealing lifestyle or attitude  such as the tommy bahama  lilly pulitzer and ben sherman brands 
we believe that by generating an emotional connection with our target consumer  lifestyle brands can command higher price points at retail  resulting in higher earnings 
we also believe a successful lifestyle brand can provide opportunities for branded retail operations as well as licensing opportunities in product categories beyond our core business 
our strategy of emphasizing owned lifestyle branded apparel products is driven in part by the continued consolidation in the retail industry and the increasing concentration of apparel manufacturing in a relatively limited number of offshore markets 
we believe that these two trends will continue to make the branded apparel business model more appealing than a business focused on private label apparel  which we define as products sold exclusively to one customer under a brand name that is owned by or licensed to such customer and not owned by the seller 
significant steps we have undertaken to accomplish this transition towards our brand focused strategy have included the june acquisition of the tommy bahama brand and operations  the july acquisition of the ben sherman brand and operations  the june divestiture of our former womenswear group operations  which produced private label women sportswear  primarily for mass merchants  and the closing of all but one of our manufacturing facilities 
in fiscal  we took two very important additional steps in continuing our transition with our december  acquisition of the lilly pulitzer brand and operations and the january  divestiture of substantially all of the operations and assets of our former oxford apparel group  which produced a mix of private label and branded sportswear  primarily for department stores  mass merchants  national chains and discount retailers 
in the future  we may add additional lifestyle brands to our portfolio  if we identify appropriate lifestyle brands which meet our investment criteria 

table of contents since acquiring the tommy bahama brand and operations and the ben sherman brand and operations  we have invested significant resources in those brands through various methods including increasing their full price retail store footprints  developing and enhancing their e commerce websites and funding marketing initiatives which increase the visibility of the brands 
we anticipate further investments in tommy bahama  lilly pulitzer and ben sherman to increase the retail store footprint of the brands  further enhance the brands e commerce operations  and expand tommy bahama to markets outside of north america 
we believe our strong balance sheet and liquidity coupled with positive cash flow from operations will provide us ample liquidity to fund these investments  while at the same time allowing us to maintain the financial flexibility to opportunistically enhance our capital structure and pursue desirable acquisitions  if any 
we distribute our products through several wholesale distribution channels  including department stores  specialty stores  national chains  specialty catalogs  mass merchants and internet retailers 
approximately of our consolidated net sales in fiscal were to customers located in the united states  with the remaining net sales primarily being sales of our ben sherman products in the united kingdom and europe 
our ten largest customers represented approximately of our consolidated net sales for fiscal  with no individual customer representing more than of our consolidated net sales 
we also operate retail stores  restaurants and internet websites for some of our brands 
during fiscal  direct to consumer sales from our retail stores  restaurants and internet websites accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales 
our business is primarily operated through four operating groups consisting of tommy bahama  lilly pulitzer  ben sherman  and lanier clothes 
generally  each operating group is differentiated by its own distinctive brands or products  product styling  pricing strategies  distribution channels and target consumers 
each operating group is managed to maximize the long term sustainable return on capital invested and to develop its brands and operations in coordination with our overall strategic plans 
we believe that maintaining and growing our owned and licensed brands are critical to our success 
our owned brands include the following tommy bahama lilly pulitzer ben sherman billy london oxford golf nickelson arnold brant we currently hold licenses to produce and sell certain categories of apparel products under the following brands kenneth cole dockers geoffrey beene sales of products using licensed brands accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal in addition to their branded sales  lanier clothes also sells private label products  which comprised approximately of our consolidated net sales in fiscal we operate in highly competitive domestic and international markets in which numerous us based and foreign apparel firms compete 
additionally  the apparel industry is cyclical and dependent upon the overall level of discretionary consumer spending  which changes as regional  domestic and international economic conditions change 
often  negative economic conditions have a longer and more severe impact on the apparel and retail industry than the conditions have on other 
table of contents industries 
the weak global economic conditions that began in fiscal continued to impact each of our operating groups through fiscal  although we did observe some signs of recovery 
we continue to focus on minimizing inventory markdown risk and promotional pressure  but at the same time we anticipate purchasing inventory more aggressively in if economic conditions continue to show improvement 
we believe that fiscal will be impacted by pricing pressures on raw materials  fuel  transportation and other costs necessary for the production and sourcing of apparel products 
in addition to the impact of competition and economic factors  our operations are subject to certain other risks  many of which are beyond our ability to control or predict 
important factors relating to certain risks which could impact our business include  but are not limited to  those described in part i  item a 
risk factors of this report 
operating groups our business is primarily operated through four operating groups tommy bahama  lilly pulitzer  ben sherman and lanier clothes 
we identify our operating groups based on the way our management organizes the components of our business for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance 
all amounts included in this report and in our consolidated financial statements reflect our changes in operating groups during fiscal including the acquisition of the lilly pulitzer brand and operations  resulting in the creation of our lilly pulitzer operating group  the sale of substantially all of the operations and assets of our former oxford apparel operating group  which are now classified as discontinued operations  the reclassification of our oxford golf business and our lyons  georgia distribution center operations into corporate and other  as these activities were previously included in oxford apparel  but will continue to be operated by us  and the reclassification of certain corporate service costs from oxford apparel  where they were previously allocated  to corporate and other  as there is uncertainty in whether there will be a reduction in those costs as a result of the oxford apparel sale

therefore  the corporate and other net sales and operating income loss do not equal amounts previously reported

table of contents consumer for each brand 
the design process combines feedback from buyers and sales agents along with market trend research 
during fiscal  lanier clothes acquired the majority of its products on a package purchase of finished goods basis from third party producers outside of the united states  primarily in china 
as the ability and willingness of third party manufacturers to finance raw materials continues to increase  we anticipate that lanier clothes will continue to increase the percentage of goods acquired as package purchases of finished goods rather than cmt purchases 
cmt purchases are purchases whereby we supply the fabric and purchase cut  sew and finish labor or cut  make  trim from our third party producers 
for cmt purchases  we procure and retain ownership of the fabric which we purchased throughout the manufacturing and finishing process 
lanier clothes manages production in asia and latin america through a combination of efforts from our lanier clothes offices in atlanta  georgia and third party buying agents 
lanier clothes purchased goods from approximately suppliers in fiscal the ten largest suppliers of lanier clothes provided more than of the products lanier clothes acquired from third parties during fiscal in addition to purchasing products from third parties  lanier clothes also operates a manufacturing facility  located in merida  mexico  which produced approximately of our lanier clothes products during fiscal our various lanier clothes products are manufactured from a variety of fibers  including wool  silk  linen  cotton and other natural fibers  as well as synthetics and blends of these materials

for lanier clothes  we utilize a distribution center located in toccoa  georgia  where we receive goods from our suppliers  inspect those products and ship the goods to our customers 
we seek to maintain sufficient levels of inventory to support programs for pre booked orders and to meet increased customer demand for at once ordering

table of contents trademarks as discussed above  we own trademarks  several of which are very important to our business 
generally  our significant trademarks are subject to registrations and pending applications throughout the world for use on a variety of items of apparel and  in some cases  apparel related products  accessories  home furnishings and beauty products  as well as in connection with retail services 
we continue to expand our worldwide usage and registration of certain of our trademarks 
in general  trademarks remain valid and enforceable as long as the trademarks are used in connection with our products and services and the required registration renewals are filed 
our significant trademarks are discussed within each operating group description 
important factors relating to risks associated with our trademarks include  but are not limited to  those described in part i  item a 
risk factors 
competition we sell our products in highly competitive domestic and international markets in which numerous united states based and foreign apparel firms compete 
no single apparel firm or small group of apparel firms dominates the apparel industry and our direct competitors vary by operating group and distribution channel 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the apparel industry are design  brand image  consumer preference  price  quality  marketing and customer service 
we believe our ability to compete successfully in styling and marketing is related to our ability to foresee changes and trends in fashion and consumer preference  and to present appealing products for consumers 
in some instances  particularly with respect to our private label businesses  a retailer that is our customer may compete directly with us by sourcing its products directly 
important factors relating to risks associated with competitive factors in our industry include  but are not limited to  those described in part i  item a 
risk factors 
seasonal aspects of business and order backlog although our various product lines are sold on a year round basis  the demand for specific products or styles may be seasonal 
for example  the demand for tommy bahama and lilly pulitzer products in our principal markets is generally higher in the spring season and lower in the fall season 
typically  our wholesale products are sold prior to each of the retail selling seasons  including spring  summer  fall and holiday 
as the timing of product shipments and other events affecting the retail business may vary  we do not believe that results for any particular quarter are necessarily indicative of results for the full fiscal year 
in addition  we do not believe that the fiscal distribution of net sales and operating income is necessarily indicative of the expected distribution in future years as the information below does not reflect a full year operations of lilly pulitzer and individual quarters may be impacted by certain unusual or non recurring items  economic conditions or other factors 
the following table presents the percentage of net sales and operating income by quarter unaudited for fiscal first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter net sales operating income order backlog as of january  and january   we had booked orders for our continuing operations totaling million and million  respectively  substantially all of which we expect will be or were shipped within six months after each such date 
once we receive a specific purchase order  the dollar value of such order is included in our booked orders 
a portion of our business consists of at once edi quick response programs with large retailers 
replenishment shipments under these 
table of contents programs generally have such an abbreviated order life that they are excluded from the order backlog completely 
we do not believe that this backlog information is necessarily indicative of sales to be expected for future periods as the timing of customer orders  and therefore the order backlog can be impacted by a variety of factors 
import restrictions and other government regulations we are exposed to certain risks as a result of our international operations 
almost all of our merchandise is manufactured by foreign suppliers 
during fiscal  we sourced approximately of our products acquired as part of our continuing operations from china 
we do not currently expect this concentration of sourcing from china to be materially impacted in the future solely as a result of lilly pulitzer operations 
our imported products are subject to customs  trade and other laws and regulations governing their entry into the united states and other countries where we sell our products 
from time to time and in the ordinary course of business  we become subject to claims by the united states customs service and similar government authorities in other countries for duties and related fees 
substantially all of the merchandise we acquire is subject to duties which are assessed on the value of the imported product 
duty rates vary depending on the type of garment and its fiber content 
during fiscal  cotton products represented approximately one half of our total imported products and were subject to an average duty rate of approximately  while silk and linen products represented approximately of our total imported products and were subject to an average duty rate of approximately 
duty rates are subject to change in future periods 
quotas on apparel and textiles among the world trade organization member nations were eliminated effective january  and resulted in the continued shift of sourcing and manufacturing from the western hemisphere to asia 
although china accession agreement for membership in the wto resulted in the elimination of quotas on chinese made textile and apparel products into wto countries  the united states and european countries are still allowed in certain circumstances to unilaterally impose anti dumping duties in response to a particular product being imported from china or other countries in such increased quantities as to cause  or threaten to cause  serious damage to the comparable domestic industry 
in addition  countervailing duties are other duties which can be imposed by the united states in cases where it finds that subsidies are being provided by a foreign government to its manufacturers and where this subsidized merchandise causes or threatens to cause damage to the comparable domestic us industry 
additionally  there have been some recent legislative proposals which  if adopted  would treat manipulation by china of the value of its currency as actionable under the anti dumping or countervailing duty laws 
the imposition of anti dumping or countervailing duty on products that we import would increase the cost of those products to us and we may not be able to pass on any such cost increases to our customers 
in january  the united states customs service began enforcement of a regulation requiring importer security filings 
the regulation requires us to submit additional cargo details before the cargo is loaded onto an ocean vessel bound for the united states 
we could become subject to penalties and or delays in obtaining our products from the united states customs service if we fail to comply with these existing or future regulations 
similar customs import regulations went into effect on january  in the european union  where a significant majority of ben sherman net sales are generated 
in addition  apparel and other products sold by us are subject to increasingly stringent and complex product performance and safety standards  laws and other regulations  including the consumer product safety improvement act of  california proposition and those adopted by the federal trade commission 
these regulations relate principally to product labeling  licensing requirements and certification of product safety 
we believe that we are in compliance with those regulations 
our 
table of contents licensed products and licensing partners are also subject to regulation 
our agreements require our licensing partners to operate in compliance with all laws and regulations  and we are not aware of any violations which could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on our business or results of operations 
although we have not been materially inhibited from doing business in desired markets in the past  we cannot assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and brands and enter into new markets 
our management regularly monitors proposed regulatory changes and the existing regulatory environment  including any impact on our operations or on our ability to import products from china and other countries 
important factors relating to risks associated with government regulations include  but are not limited to  those described in part i  item a 
risk factors 
employees as of january   we employed approximately  persons  of whom approximately were employed in the united states 
approximately of our employees were retail store and restaurant employees

item a 
risk factors our business faces many risks  many of which are outside of our control 
the following factors  as well as factors described elsewhere in this report or in our other filings with the sec that could materially affect our business  financial condition or operating results  should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impact our business operations or financial results 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or operating results may be adversely affected 

table of contents our business is and will continue to be heavily influenced by economic trends and general economic conditions  which may be exacerbated by global political or economic uncertainty resulting from recent events  and a deterioration or worsening of consumer confidence or consumer purchases of discretionary products may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the apparel industry is cyclical and dependent upon the overall level of discretionary consumer spending  which changes as regional  domestic and international economic conditions change 
often  the apparel industry experiences longer periods of recession and greater declines than the general economy 
overall economic conditions that affect discretionary consumer spending include  but are not limited to  employment levels  recessions  energy costs  interest rates  tax rates  personal debt levels  housing prices and stock market volatility 
uncertainty about the future may also impact the level of consumer confidence or discretionary consumer spending or result in shifts in consumer spending to products other than apparel 
any deterioration in general economic or political conditions  acts of war or terrorism or other factors that create uncertainty or alter the discretionary consumer habits in our key markets  particularly the united states and the united kingdom  could reduce our sales  increase our costs of goods sold or require us to significantly modify our current business practices and  consequently  adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
these and other events that impact our operating results could also result in adverse consequences to our business  such as our inability to comply with financial covenants under our debt instruments 
the economies of the united states  united kingdom and other parts of the world weakened as a result of the global economic crisis which commenced in and continued through we saw intermittent signs of stabilization in economic conditions in the united states and globally during fiscal  but there are no assurances that the global economy will continue to recover 
those recessionary conditions have adversely impacted retail sales of apparel and other consumer products  and have impacted our business 
in addition  concerns regarding acts of terrorism  the wars in iraq and afghanistan  political unrest throughout the middle east and the march earthquake in japan  among other events  have created significant global economic and political uncertainties that may affect consumer demand for our products in the united states and other parts of the world  as well as result in disruptions to sourcing of our products from asian markets 
these or similar factors could consequently reduce our sales and or increase our costs of goods sold 
additionally  significant changes in the operations or liquidity for any of the parties with which we conduct our business  including suppliers  customers  trademark licensees and lenders  among others  now or in the future  or in the access to capital markets for us or any such parties  could result in lower demand for our products  lower sales  higher costs or other disruptions in our business 
our success depends on the reputation and value of our owned and licensed brand names  including  in particular  tommy bahama  lilly pulitzer and ben sherman  and actions by us  our wholesale customers  licensees or others who have interests in our brands could diminish the reputation or value of our brands and adversely affect our business operations 
the success of our business depends on the reputation and value of our owned and licensed brand names 
the value of our brands could be diminished by actions taken by us  for instance by becoming overly promotional  or by our wholesale customers or others  including marketing partners  who have interests in the brands 
we cannot always control the marketing and promotion of our products by our wholesale customers or other third parties and actions by such parties that are inconsistent with our own marketing efforts or that otherwise adversely affect the appeal of our products could diminish the value or reputation of one or more of our brands and have an adverse effect on our sales and business operations 
in addition  we license certain of our brands  such as tommy bahama  lilly pulitzer and ben sherman  to third party licensees 
while we take significant steps to ensure the reputation of our 
table of contents brands is maintained through our license agreements  there can be no guarantee our brands will not be negatively impacted through our association with products outside of our core apparel products or due to the actions of a licensee 
the improper or detrimental actions of a licensee could significantly impact the perception of our brands 
the apparel industry is subject to rapidly evolving fashion trends  and we must continuously offer innovative and market appropriate products to maintain and grow our existing businesses 
failure to offer innovative and market appropriate products may adversely affect our sales and lead to excess inventory  markdowns and or dilution of our brands 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the apparel industry are design  brand image  consumer preference  price  quality  marketing and customer service 
although certain of our products carry over from season to season  the apparel industry in general is subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and shifting consumer demands 
in particular  we believe that our lifestyle branded tommy bahama  lilly pulitzer and ben sherman products may be more susceptible to changing fashion trends and consumer preferences than apparel products generally 
accordingly  we must anticipate  identify and capitalize upon emerging fashion trends 
we believe that our success depends on our ability to continuously develop  source  market and deliver a wide variety of innovative  fashionable and desirable brands and products 
these products must be offered at appropriate price points in their respective distribution channels 
sales growth from our brands will depend largely upon our ability to continue to maintain and enhance the distinctive brand identities 
due to the competitive nature of the apparel industry  there can be no assurance that the demand for our products will not decline or that we will be able to successfully evaluate and adapt our products to align with consumers preferences  fashion trends and changes in consumer demographics 
as is typical with new products  market acceptance of new price points and designs is subject to uncertainty 
the introduction or repositioning of new lines and products often requires substantial costs in design  marketing and advertising  which may not be recovered if the products are not successful 
any failure on our part to develop appealing products and update core products could result in lower sales and or harm the reputation and desirability of our brands 
additionally  since we generally make decisions regarding product designs several months in advance of the time when consumer acceptance can be measured  such a failure could leave us with a substantial amount of unsold excess inventory  which we may be forced to sell at lower price points 
any of these factors could result in a deterioration of the appeal of our brands and products  adversely affecting our business  financial condition and operating results 
our business is subject to legal  regulatory  political and economic risks  including risks relating to the importation of our products  and our products may become less competitive as a result of adverse changes affecting our operations 
as we source substantially all of our products from foreign countries  including approximately of our product purchases from china during fiscal  we are exposed to risks associated with changes in the laws and regulations governing the importing and exporting of apparel products into and from the countries in which we operate 
some of the risks associated with importing our products from foreign countries include quotas imposed by countries in which our products are manufactured or countries into which our products are imported  which limit the amount and type of goods that may be imported annually from or into these countries  changes in social  political  labor and economic conditions or terrorist acts that could result in the disruption of trade from the countries in which our manufacturers are located  the imposition of additional or new duties  tariffs  taxes or other charges and shifts in sourcing patterns as a result of such charges  significant fluctuations in the cost of raw materials  significant delays in the delivery of our products  due to security considerations  rapid fluctuations in sourcing costs  including costs for raw 
table of contents materials and labor  the imposition of antidumping or countervailing duties  fluctuations in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies  and restrictions on the transfer of funds to or from foreign countries 
the imposition of a quota arrangement between the united states and china on our products  or the elimination of duty free treatment or our inability to qualify for such benefits  would adversely impact our business by increasing our cost of goods sold 
in addition  our products are subject to increasingly stringent and complex product performance and safety standards  laws and other regulations  such as the consumer product safety improvement act of and california proposition  particularly given the concentration of our retail stores in the state of california 
failure to comply with such regulations could result in a delay  non delivery or mandated destruction of inventory shipments during key seasons  financial penalties and or harm to our reputation and business relationships  and compliance with existing and future regulations could increase our cost of goods sold 
our  or any of our suppliers  failure to comply with customs or similar laws or any other applicable regulations could restrict our ability to import products or lead to fines  penalties or adverse publicity  and future regulatory actions or trade agreements may provide our competitors with a material advantage over us or materially increase our costs 
significant fluctuations and volatility in the price of raw materials and freight may materially increase our costs  some or all of which we may be unable to pass on to our customers 
most of the products we purchase from third party producers are package purchases  and we and our third party suppliers rely on the availability of raw materials at reasonable prices 
the principal fabrics used in our business are cotton  linens  wools  silk  other natural fibers  synthetics and blends of these materials 
the prices paid for these fabrics depend on the market price for raw materials used to produce them 
we have seen a sustained increase in the costs of raw materials  particularly cotton  as a result of rising demand from the economic recovery  weather related supply disruptions  significant declines in us inventory and a sharp rise in the futures market for cotton  which has been compounded by increased costs of transportation of our products as a result of sustained increases in oil prices 
in addition  the cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing process  such as oil related commodity prices and other raw materials  such as dyes and chemicals  and other costs  can fluctuate 
we historically have not entered into any futures contracts to hedge commodity prices 
any significant increase in the price of raw materials or freight may materially increase our costs  some or all of which we may be unable to pass on to our customers 
we are dependent upon the ability of our third party producers  substantially all of whom are located in foreign countries  to meet our requirements  any failures by these producers to meet our requirements  or the unavailability of suitable producers at reasonable prices may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis or result in higher costs or reduced net sales 
we source substantially all of our products from non exclusive  third party producers located in foreign countries 
although we place a high value on long term relationships with our suppliers  generally we do not have long term contracts but  instead  conduct business on an order by order basis 
therefore  we compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers 
we regularly depend upon the ability of third party producers to secure a sufficient supply of raw materials  adequately finance the production of goods ordered and maintain sufficient manufacturing and shipping capacity 
although we monitor production in third party manufacturing locations  we cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with our manufacturers  such as the reduction of availability of production capacity  errors in complying with product specifications  insufficient quality control  failures to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs 
such difficulties may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality products to 
table of contents our customers on a timely basis  which may  in turn  have a negative impact on our customer relationships and result in lower net sales 
we also require third party producers to meet certain standards in terms of working conditions  environmental protection and other matters before placing business with them 
as a result of costs relating to compliance with these standards  we may pay higher prices than some of our competitors for products 
in addition  failure by us or our independent manufacturers to adhere to labor or other laws or business practices accepted as ethical  and the potential litigation  negative publicity and political pressure relating to any of these events  could disrupt our operations or harm our reputation 
the apparel industry is highly competitive  and we face significant competitive threats to our business from various third parties that could reduce our sales  increase our costs  reduce price points for our products  and or decrease margins 
the highly competitive apparel industry includes numerous domestic and foreign apparel designers  manufacturers  distributors  importers  licensors and retailers  some of which may also be our customers and some of whom are significantly larger and have significantly greater financial resources than we do 
the level and nature of our competition varies  and the number of our direct competitors and the intensity of competition may increase as we expand into other markets or product lines or as other companies expand into our markets or product lines 
some of our competitors may be able to adapt to changes in consumer demand more quickly  to devote greater resources to establishing brand recognition or to adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can 
additionally  certain of our competitors offer apparel for sale at significant discounts  particularly in response to weak economic conditions  which results in more pressure to reduce prices or the risk that our products may not be as desirable as lower priced products 
these competitive factors within the apparel industry may result in reduced sales  increased costs  lower prices for our products and or decreased margins 
our concentration of retail stores and wholesale customers for certain of our products exposes us to certain regional risks 
our retail locations are heavily concentrated in certain geographic areas in the united states  including florida and california for our tommy bahama retail stores  florida for our lilly pulitzer retail stores and the united kingdom for our ben sherman retail stores 
as of january   out of our tommy bahama retail stores were located in these two us states  five out of our lilly pulitzer retail stores were located in florida and more than half of our owned ben sherman retail stores  including outlets  were located in the united kingdom 
additionally  a significant portion of our wholesale sales for tommy bahama and ben sherman products are concentrated in the same geographic areas as our own retail store locations for these brands 
due to this concentration  we have heightened exposure to factors that impact these regions  including general economic conditions  weather patterns  natural disasters  changing demographics and other factors 
we depend on a group of key customers for a significant portion of our wholesale sales 
a significant adverse change in a customer relationship or in a customer financial position could negatively impact our net sales and profitability 
we generate a significant percentage of our wholesale sales from a few major customers 
during fiscal  sales to our five largest customers accounted for approximately of our consolidated wholesale sales and sales to our largest wholesale customer represented approximately of our consolidated wholesale sales 
a decrease in the number of stores that carry our products  restructuring of our customers operations  more centralized purchasing decisions  direct sourcing and greater leverage by customers  as a result of further consolidation in the retail industry or otherwise could result in lower prices  realignment of customer affiliations or other factors which could negatively impact our net sales and profitability 

table of contents we generally do not have long term contracts with any of our customers 
instead  we rely on long standing relationships with these customers and our position within the marketplace 
as a result  purchases generally occur on an order by order basis  and each relationship can generally be terminated by either party at any time 
a decision by one or more major customers to terminate its relationship with us or to reduce its purchases from us  whether motivated by competitive considerations  quality or style issues  financial difficulties  economic conditions or otherwise  could adversely affect our net sales and profitability  as it would be difficult to immediately  if at all  replace this business with new customers or increase sales volumes with other existing customers 
in addition  due to long product lead times  several of our product lines are designed and manufactured in anticipation of orders for sale 
we make commitments for fabric and production in connection with these lines 
these commitments can be made up to several months prior to the receipt of firm orders from customers  and if orders do not materialize or are canceled  we may incur expenses to terminate our fabric and production commitments or to dispose of excess inventories 
we also extend credit to several of our key customers without requiring collateral  which results in a large amount of receivables from just a few customers 
during the past several years  companies in the apparel industry  including some of our customers  have had financial difficulties and have experienced tightened credit markets and declining sales and profitability on a comparable store basis 
if one or more of our key customers experiences significant problems in the future  including as a result of general weakness in the apparel industry  our sales may be reduced  and the risk associated with extending credit to these customers may increase 
a significant adverse change in a customer financial position could cause us to limit or discontinue business with that customer  require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer receivables or limit our ability to collect amounts related to previous shipments to that customer 
these or other events related to our significant customers could adversely affect our net sales and profitability 
the acquisition of new businesses  such as our recent acquisition of the lilly pulitzer brand and operations  has certain inherent risks  including  for example  strains on our management team  unexpected acquisition costs  and  in some instances  contingent payments 
one component of our business strategy is the acquisition of new businesses or product lines as and when appropriate investment opportunities are available 
consistent with this strategy  in december  we acquired the lilly pulitzer brand and operations 
in connection with our acquisition of the lilly pulitzer brand and operations  or in any future acquisitions  we may become responsible for unexpected liabilities that we failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence 
although we have required the selling shareholders of sugartown to indemnify us against undisclosed liabilities  we cannot assure you that the indemnification  even if obtained  will be enforceable  collectible or sufficient in amount  scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the business or assets acquired 
any of these liabilities  individually or in the aggregate  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  integrating acquired businesses is a complex  time consuming and expensive process 
the integration process for newly acquired businesses  including the lilly pulitzer brand and operations  could create for us a number of challenges and adverse consequences associated with the integration of product lines  employees  sales teams and outsourced manufacturers  employee turnover  including key management and creative personnel of the acquired and existing businesses  disruption in product cycles for newly acquired product lines  maintenance of acceptable standards  controls  procedures and policies  and the impairment of relationships with customers of the acquired and existing businesses 
further  we may not be able to manage the combined operations and assets effectively or realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 

table of contents in connection with our acquisition of the lilly pulitzer brand and operations  we entered into a contingent consideration agreement with the selling shareholders that may require us to pay up to million in performance based contingent payments to those shareholders over the next four years 
although we will only be required to make these payments if the acquired business is successful  the contingent payments are payable based on that business achieving earnings targets 
if the acquired sugartown business is successful but the rest of our business is not successful  we may have difficulty making the contingent payments 
the principal shareholders of sugartown from whom we acquired the business are key members of management of our lilly pulitzer group 
it is possible that their interests with respect to the contingent payments will differ from our interests or those of our shareholders 
our operations are reliant on information technology  and any interruption or other failure in our information technology systems  including disruptions at any of our principal distribution facilities  may impair our ability to compete effectively in the apparel industry  including our ability to provide services to our customers and meet the needs of management 
the efficient operation of our business is dependent on information technology 
information systems are used in all stages of our operations from design to distribution and as a method of communication with our customers and suppliers 
additionally  certain of our operating groups utilize e commerce websites to sell goods directly to consumers 
our management also relies on information systems to provide relevant and accurate information in order to allocate resources and forecast and report our operating results 
service interruptions may occur as a result of a number of factors  including computer viruses  hacking or other unlawful activities by third parties  disasters  or failures to properly install  upgrade  integrate  protect  repair or maintain our systems and e commerce websites 
any material disruption in our information technology systems  or any failure to timely  efficiently and effectively integrate new systems  could have an adverse affect on our business or results of operations 
in addition  our ability to meet customer expectations  manage inventory and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies depends on the proper operation of our primary distribution facilities  some of which are owned and others of which are operated by third parties 
finished garments from our contractors are inspected and stored at these distribution facilities 
if any of these distribution facilities were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason  or if the goods in the distribution center were otherwise unavailable for shipment  as a result of a technology failure or otherwise  we could experience a reduction in sales  a substantial loss of inventory or higher costs and longer lead times associated with the distribution of our products during the time it takes to reopen or replace the facility or to restore the technological capabilities of the facility 
this could negatively affect our operating results and our customer relationships 
compliance with privacy and information laws and requirements could be costly  and a breach of information security or privacy could adversely affect our business 
the regulatory environment governing our use of individually identifiable data of customers  employees and others is complex and a matter of growing public concern 
privacy and information security laws and requirements change frequently  and compliance with them may require us to incur costs to make necessary systems changes and implement new administrative processes 
if a data security breach occurs  our reputation could be damaged and we could experience lost sales  fines or lawsuits 
our business could be harmed if we fail to maintain proper inventory levels 
we schedule production from third party manufacturers based on our expectations for the demand for our products 
however  various factors could result in variances from our forecasts 
as a result  we may be unable to sell the products we have ordered in advance from manufacturers or that we have in our inventory  which may result in inventory markdowns or the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices 
these events could significantly harm our operating results and impair the image of our brands 

table of contents conversely  we may not be in a position to order quality products from our manufacturers in a timely manner and or we may experience inventory shortages as demand for our products increases  which might result in unfilled orders  negatively impact customer relationships  diminish brand loyalty and result in lost revenues  any of which could harm our business 
we operate in various countries with differing laws and regulations  which may impair our ability to maintain compliance with regulations and laws 
although we attempt to abide by the laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate  the complexity of the laws and regulations to which we are subject  including customs regulations  labor laws  competition laws  consumer protection laws and domestic and international tax legislation  makes it difficult for us to ensure that we are currently  or will be in the future  compliant with all laws and regulations 
we may be required to make significant expenditures or modify our business practices to comply with existing or future laws or regulations  and unfavorable resolution to litigation or a violation of applicable laws and regulations may increase our costs and materially limit our ability to operate our business 
we may not be successful in identifying locations and negotiating appropriate lease terms for retail stores and restaurants 
an integral part of our strategy has been to develop and operate retail stores and restaurants for certain of our lifestyle brands 
net sales from retail stores and restaurants were approximately of our consolidated net sales during fiscal successful operation of our retail stores and restaurants depends  in part  on the overall ability of the retail location to attract a consumer base sufficient to make store sales volume profitable 
if we are unable to identify new locations with consumer traffic sufficient to support a profitable sales level  retail growth may consequently be limited 
further  if existing retail stores and restaurants do not maintain a sufficient customer base that provides a reasonable sales volume  it could have a negative impact on our sales  gross margin  and results of operations 
from time to time  we seek to downsize or close some of our retail store or restaurant operations  which may require a modification or termination of an existing lease  such actions may require payment of exit fees and or result in fixed asset impairment charges  the amounts of which could be material 
in addition  there has been some recent consolidation among commercial real estate developers  mall operators and or shopping center managers 
significant consolidation within the commercial real estate development  operation and or management industries impacting locations where we might operate retail stores and or restaurants or that we might otherwise consider desirable could reduce our leverage with such parties  thereby materially adversely affecting the terms of future leases for our retail stores and restaurants or making entering into long term commitments with such parties cost prohibitive 
our business  in particular our retail and restaurant operations  is subject to state and local laws and regulations for health  safety  labor and similar operational issues 
the costs of compliance with  or the violation of  such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our costs or operations  and we may be adversely impacted by negative publicity surrounding any of these issues 
we operate retail stores and restaurants in numerous jurisdictions 
our retail and restaurant operations are subject to comprehensive state and local laws and regulations on a wide range of employment  safety and other matters 
the complexity of these laws and regulations to which we are subject  which may vary widely by jurisdiction  makes it difficult for us to ensure that we are currently  or will be in the future  compliant with all laws and regulations 
we may be required to make significant expenditures or modify our business practices to comply with existing or future laws or 
table of contents regulations  and unfavorable resolution to litigation or a violation of applicable laws and regulations may increase our costs and materially limit our ability to operate our business 
in addition  the restaurant industry is highly competitive and requires compliance with a variety of federal  state and local regulations 
in particular  all of our tommy bahama restaurants serve alcohol and  therefore  maintain liquor licenses 
our ability to maintain our liquor licenses depends on our compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
the loss of a liquor license would adversely affect the profitability of a restaurant 
additionally  as a participant in the restaurant industry  we face risks related to food quality  food borne illness  injury  health inspection scores and labor relations 
regardless of whether allegations related to these matters are valid or whether we become liable  we may be materially affected by negative publicity associated with these issues 
the negative impact of adverse publicity relating to one restaurant may extend beyond the restaurant involved to affect some or all of the other restaurants  as well as the image of the tommy bahama brand as a whole 
we may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property or may otherwise have our brand names harmed 
we believe that our registered and common law trademarks and other intellectual property  as well as other contractual arrangements  including licenses and other proprietary intellectual property rights  have significant value and are important to our continued success and our competitive position due to their recognition by retailers and consumers 
approximately of our net sales in fiscal were attributable to branded products for which we own the trademark 
therefore  our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to protect and preserve our intellectual property 
we rely on laws in the united states and other countries to protect our proprietary rights 
however  we may not be able to sufficiently prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization  particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
the use of our intellectual property or similar intellectual property by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed  causing us to lose sales or otherwise harm the reputation of our brands 
additionally  there can be no assurance that the actions that we have taken will be adequate to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights 
although we have not been materially inhibited from selling products in connection with trademark disputes  as we extend our brands into new product categories and new product lines and expand the geographic scope of our marketing  including internationally  we could become subject to litigation based on allegations of the infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties 
in the event a claim of infringement against us is successful  we may be required to pay damages  royalties or license fees to continue to use intellectual property rights that we had been using  or we may be unable to obtain necessary licenses from third parties at a reasonable cost or within a reasonable time 
litigation and other legal action of this type  regardless of whether it is successful  could result in substantial costs to us and diversion of our management and other resources 
our business depends on our senior management and other key personnel  and the unexpected loss of individuals integral to our business  our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future or our failure to successfully plan for and implement succession of our senior management and key personnel may have an adverse effect on our operations  business relationships and ability to execute our strategies 
our senior management has substantial experience and expertise in the apparel and related industries 
our success depends upon disciplined execution at all levels of our organization  including the members of our senior management 
competition for qualified personnel in the apparel industry is intense  and we compete to attract and retain these individuals with other companies which may have greater financial resources 
in addition  we will need to plan for the succession of our senior management and successfully integrate new members of management within our organization 
this may 
table of contents include situations in which individuals join our company as a result of acquisitions that we make  such as the recent employment of the principals of the lilly pulitzer brand and operations to lead our lilly pulitzer group  and may be more familiar with certain of the operational aspects of acquired businesses than other members of our management 
the unexpected loss of any of our senior management  or the unsuccessful integration of new leadership  could negatively affect our operations  business relationships and ability to execute our strategies 
our foreign sourcing operations as well as the sale of products in foreign markets result in an exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
as a result of our international operations  we are exposed to certain risks in conducting business outside of the united states 
substantially all of our orders for the production of apparel in foreign countries are denominated in us dollars 
purchase prices for our products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers  either of which may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold in the future 
if the value of the us dollar decreases relative to certain foreign currencies in the future  then the prices that we negotiate for products could increase  and it is possible that we would not be able to pass this increase on to customers  which would negatively impact our margins 
if the value of the us dollar increases between the time a price is set and payment for a product  the price we pay may be higher than that paid for comparable goods by competitors that pay for goods in local currencies  and these competitors may be able to sell their products at more competitive prices 
additionally  currency fluctuations could also disrupt the business of our independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and difficult to finance 
we received us dollars for approximately of our product sales during fiscal the sales denominated in foreign currencies primarily relate to ben sherman sales in the united kingdom and europe 
an increase in the value of the us dollar compared to these other currencies in which we have sales could result in lower levels of sales and earnings in our consolidated statements of operations  although the sales in foreign currencies could be equal to or greater than amounts in prior periods 
in addition  to the extent that the stronger us dollar increases costs  and the products are sold in another currency  but the additional cost cannot be passed on to our customers  our gross margins will be negatively impacted 
we generally do not engage in hedging activities with respect to our exposure to foreign currency risk except that  on occasion  we do purchase foreign currency forward exchange contracts for our goods purchased on us dollar terms that are expected to be sold in the united kingdom and europe 
we hold licenses for the use of other parties brand names  and we cannot guarantee our continued use of such brand names or the quality or salability of such brand names 
we have entered into license and design agreements to use certain trademarks and trade names  such as kenneth cole  dockers and geoffrey beene  to market our products 
approximately of our net sales during fiscal related to the products for which we license the use of the trademark for specific product categories 
these license and design agreements will expire at various dates in the future 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew these licenses on acceptable terms upon expiration or that we will be able to acquire new licenses to use other popular trademarks 
the termination or expiration of a license agreement will cause us to lose the sales and any associated profits generated pursuant to such license and in certain cases could result in an impairment charge for related intangible assets 
in addition to certain compliance obligations  all of our significant licenses provide minimum thresholds for royalty payments and advertising expenditures for each license year  which we must pay regardless of the level of our sales of the licensed products 
if these thresholds are not met  our licensors may be permitted contractually to terminate these agreements or seek payment of minimum 
table of contents royalties even if the minimum sales are not achieved 
in addition  our licensors produce their own products and license their trademarks to other third parties  and we are unable to control the quality of these goods that others produce 
if licensors or others do not maintain the quality of these trademarks or if the brand image deteriorates  our sales and any associated profits generated by such brands may decline 
we make use of debt to finance our operations  which exposes us to risks that could adversely affect our business  financial position and operating results 
our levels of debt vary as a result of the seasonality of our business  investments in acquisitions and working capital and divestitures 
as of january   we had million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our senior secured notes and no borrowings outstanding under our us revolving credit agreement or our uk revolving credit agreement 
our debt levels may increase in the future under our existing facilities or potentially under new facilities  or the terms or forms of our financing arrangements in the future may change 
there are no assurances that in the future we will be able to refinance our debt obligations on terms that are satisfactory to us 
our indebtedness includes  and any future indebtedness may include  certain obligations and limitations  including the periodic payment of principal and interest  maintenance of certain covenants and certain other limitations related to additional debt  dividend payments  investments and dispositions of assets 
our ability to satisfy these obligations will be dependent upon our business  financial condition and operating results 
these obligations and limitations may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and limit our flexibility in carrying out our business plan and planning for  or reacting to  changes in the industry in which we operate 
in addition  we have interest rate risk on indebtedness under our us revolving credit agreement and us revolving credit agreement 
we generally do not engage in hedging activities with respect to our interest rate risk  and an increase in interest rates may require us to pay a greater amount of our funds from operations towards interest  even if the amount of borrowings outstanding remains the same 
as a result  we may have to revise or delay our business plans  reduce or delay capital expenditures or otherwise adjust our plans for operations 
we may be unable to successfully execute a key component of our business strategy  which is to grow our business through organic growth and or  if and when appropriate  acquisitions of lifestyle brands that fit within our business model  and any failure to successfully execute this aspect of our business strategy may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
one key component of our business strategy is to grow our business through organic growth and or  if and when appropriate  acquisitions of lifestyle brands that fit within our business model  such as our acquisition of the lilly pulitzer brand and operations in december organic growth may be achieved by  among other things  increasing our market share in existing markets  including to existing wholesale customers  selling our products in new markets  including international markets  increasing sales in our direct to consumer channels  and increasing the product offerings within our various operating groups 
successful growth of our business through organic growth and or acquisitions is subject to  among other things  the ability of our management to implement plans for expanding our existing businesses and our ability to find suitable acquisition candidates at reasonable prices in the future 
we may not be successful in this regard  and our inability to grow our business may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 

table of contents divestitures of certain businesses or discontinuations of certain product lines may require us to find alternative uses for our resources 
as we did in fiscal with the sale of substantially all of the operations and assets of our former oxford apparel group and as we did during fiscal and fiscal with the restructuring of our operations at ben sherman  lanier clothes and our former oxford apparel group  we may determine that it is appropriate to divest or discontinue certain operations 
divestitures of certain businesses that do not align with our strategy or the discontinuation of certain product lines which may not provide the returns that we expect or desire may result in underutilization of our resources in the event that the operations are not replaced with new lines of business either internally or through acquisition 
there can be no guarantee that if we divest certain businesses or discontinue certain product lines that we will be able to replace the sales and profits related to these businesses or appropriately utilize our remaining resources  which may result in a decline in our operating results and or result in an inappropriate capitalization of our organization 
our operations are influenced by weather patterns and natural or man made disasters 
like other companies in the apparel industry  our sales volume and operations may be adversely affected by unseasonable weather conditions or natural or man made disasters  which may cause consumers to alter their purchasing habits or result in a disruption to our operations 
because of the seasonality of our business  the concentration of a significant proportion of our customers in certain geographic regions  the concentration of our sourcing operations and the concentration of our distribution operations  the occurrence of such events could disproportionately impact our business  financial condition and operating results

table of contents item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our operations  cash flows  liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
overview we generate revenues and cash flow primarily through the design  production  sale and distribution of branded consumer apparel for men  women and children and the licensing of company owned trademarks 
our principal markets and customers are located in the united states and  to a lesser extent  the united kingdom 
we source substantially all of our products through third party manufacturers located outside of the united states and united kingdom 
we distribute our products through our direct to consumer channels  including our retail stores  e commerce websites and restaurants  as well as through our wholesale distribution channel  which includes department stores  specialty stores  national chains  specialty catalogs  mass merchants and internet retailers 
although we have seen signs of recovery in fiscal  the last three years have been particularly challenging for our operating groups due to the weak global economic conditions which began in fiscal and continued through fiscal in much of fiscal  we purchased inventory at levels which mitigated inventory markdown risk and promotional pressure  while also maintaining the integrity of our brands 
however  these precautions also limited our growth opportunities in some cases 
although the challenging economic conditions continue to have an impact on our business and the apparel industry as a whole  and we continue to focus on minimizing inventory markdown risk and promotional pressure  we have been slightly more aggressive in our inventory purchases for fiscal and anticipate continuing to purchase inventory more aggressively if the economic conditions continue to show improvement 
we believe that fiscal will be impacted by pricing pressures on raw materials  fuel  transportation and other costs necessary for the production and sourcing of apparel products 
we continue to believe it is important to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity 
we believe that the measures we have taken to reduce working capital requirements  moderate capital expenditures for retail stores  reduce our overhead structure  refinance our significant debt agreements and divest substantially all of the operations and assets of our former oxford apparel operating group have significantly enhanced our balance sheet and liquidity  while allowing us to acquire the lilly pulitzer brand and operations and continue to operate our businesses appropriately 
we believe our strong balance sheet and liquidity will allow us to aggressively develop tommy bahama  lilly pulitzer and ben sherman  our lifestyle brands  while maintaining lanier clothes high level of performance  and at the same time maintain the financial flexibility to opportunistically enhance our capital structure and pursue desirable acquisitions  if any meet our investment criteria 
the apparel and retail industry is cyclical and dependent upon the overall level of discretionary consumer spending  which changes as regional  domestic and international economic conditions change 
the impact of negative economic conditions may have a longer and more severe impact on the apparel and retail industry than the same conditions have on other industries 
therefore  even if conditions improve in the general economy  the negative impact on the apparel and retail industry may continue

fiscal included million of net sales associated with businesses in ben sherman and lanier clothes that we have exited compared to million of such sales in fiscal improved gross margins  which benefitted from the higher proportion of net sales being tommy bahama sales and including a lifo accounting charge of million compared to a lifo accounting charge of million in fiscal additionally  gross margins were negatively impacted by approximately million of charges to cost of goods sold in lilly pulitzer resulting from the write up of acquired inventory from cost to fair value pursuant to the purchase method of accounting in connection with the sale of acquired inventory  as discussed below

we sold substantially all of the operations and assets of oxford apparel in fiscal  as discussed below 
earnings from discontinued operations for fiscal included the million gain on sale associated with this transaction and eleven months of operations for the discontinued operations  whereas fiscal included twelve months of operations for the discontinued operations 
we do not anticipate significant operating activities associated with discontinued operations in the future other than the conversion of the net retained assets and liabilities of the discontinued operations as of january   into cash  substantially all of which we anticipate will occur during the first half of fiscal and the sale of inventory and recognition of the related commission income associated with goods in process as of january  acquisition of lilly pulitzer on december   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of sugartown worldwide  inc from swi holdings  inc  pursuant to a stock purchase agreement  which was treated as an asset purchase for tax purposes 
sugartown owns the lilly pulitzer trademark and designs  sources and distributes upscale collections of women dresses  sportswear and other products to specialty and department stores  as well as through direct to consumer channels  including retail stores and an e commerce site 
the operations of the acquired business are reported as our lilly pulitzer operating group from the date of acquisition 
we paid million in cash  subject to adjustment based on net working capital as of the closing date of the acquisition 
after giving effect to a preliminary working capital adjustment  the purchase price paid was approximately million  net of acquired cash of million 
in connection with the acquisition  we entered into a contingent consideration agreement on december   pursuant to which we will be obligated to pay cash payments of up to million after each of the four fiscal years following the closing of the transaction and an additional million subsequent to the end of the fourth fiscal year  contingent upon the lilly pulitzer operating group achievement of certain performance targets 
discontinued operations oxford apparel on january   we sold to lf usa inc  substantially all of the operations and assets of our former oxford apparel operating group other than accounts receivable associated with the businesses which are being sold and all assets and operations relating to our oxford golf business and our distribution center in lyons  georgia 
the purchase price paid by lf was equal to approximately million  less an adjustment based on net working capital on the closing date of the transaction 
after giving effect to the preliminary net working capital adjustment  the purchase price paid by lf at the closing of the transaction was approximately million  of which million is being held in escrow pending completion of the final working capital adjustment and other requirements 
the net working capital deficit resulted from our retention of accounts receivable and goods in transit as of the closing date  partially offset by our retention of certain accounts payable  as of the closing date  associated with oxford apparel 
the final net working capital adjustment is expected to occur within days of the closing date of the transaction 
lf also agreed to purchase our goods in transit relating to oxford apparel following the closing of the transaction 
as of january   there were approximately million of net assets associated with the discontinued operations  including a 
table of contents million receivable for the cash held in escrow 
we anticipate that these net assets  as well as certain commissions we will earn related to goods in transit and inventory in process as of the transaction date  will be converted into cash during the first half of fiscal in connection with the consummation of the transaction described above  we  among other things  entered into license agreements with lf to grant licenses subject to the limitations set forth in the applicable license agreements to lf to use the trade name oxford apparel perpetually in connection with its business  as well as to use certain other trademarks in connection with the manufacture  sale and distribution of men dress shirts for certain periods of time in the applicable territory  a services agreement with lf pursuant to which  in exchange for various fees  we will provide certain transitional support services to lf in its operation of the transferred assets  and a limited non competition agreement with lf pursuant to which we agreed subject to the exceptions set forth in the non competition agreement not to engage in certain activities for a period of three years following the completion of the transaction 
the results of operations classified as discontinued operations include the operating results for oxford apparel as reported historically  except that the operations of our oxford golf business and the operations of our lyons  georgia distribution center are reported within corporate and other as those operations were not sold and certain corporate service costs which were previously allocated to oxford apparel are included in corporate and other as there is uncertainty in whether there will be a reduction in those costs as a result of the oxford apparel sale 
we allocated all interest expense related to our us revolving credit agreement to earnings from discontinued operations as the estimated net proceeds from the transaction and the proceeds from the settlement of the retained assets and liabilities related to the discontinued operations  substantially all of which are expected to be converted into cash during the first half of fiscal  exceed the amounts outstanding under our us revolving credit agreement during each of the periods presented 
we did not allocate any interest related to our senior secured notes to discontinued operations 
the income taxes for discontinued operations reflect the residual income tax expense after calculating the income taxes for continuing operations  excluding the discontinued operations

tommy bahama apparel unit sales increased  which was a result of the improvement in all channels of distribution 
the average selling price per unit decreased by due to tommy bahama offering more items at entry level price points below and women  home and gift items  which carry a lower average unit price than men  making up a higher proportion of tommy bahama sales mix 
lilly pulitzer we acquired lilly pulitzer on december  therefore  fiscal reflects approximately six weeks of net sales that totaled million for lilly pulitzer while the prior year includes no net sales for lilly pulitzer 
ben sherman the decrease in net sales for ben sherman was primarily due to a reduction in unit sales largely resulting from our exit from and subsequent licensing of our footwear and kids businesses and our exit from our women operations during fiscal net sales related to the footwear  kids and women businesses totaled approximately million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal net sales were also negatively impacted by a decrease in the average exchange rate of the british pound sterling versus the united states dollar during fiscal compared to the average exchange rate for fiscal the impact of the exited businesses and the exchange rate were partially offset by increased in retail sales in fiscal the average selling price per unit for ben sherman increased as retail sales represented a greater proportion of total ben sherman sales during fiscal and there were fewer off price sales in fiscal fiscal included more off price sales associated with the exited businesses 
lanier clothes the decrease in net sales for lanier clothes was primarily due to a reduction in unit sales of  which was driven by lower sales in our private label businesses and the inclusion of approximately million of net sales in fiscal related to businesses that we have exited 
these decreases in net sales were partially offset by higher sales in our branded tailored clothing business 
the average selling price per unit increased as a result of the change in sales mix as private label products typically have a lower selling price than branded products and many of the sales of the products for businesses that we exited were off price  close out sales

the fiscal restructuring charges included million related to charges associated with our exit from the ben sherman women  footwear and kids operations  as well as other streamlining initiatives  and million related to the impairment of certain leasehold improvements associated with a tommy bahama new york office lease 
these increased charges to sg a were partially offset by the million of decrease in sg a in fiscal resulting from a reduction in our estimate of expected remediation costs associated with an existing environmental reserve 

table of contents amortization of intangible assets fiscal fiscal change change amortization of intangible assets the decrease in amortization of intangibles was the result of decreases in amortization for tommy bahama and ben sherman as amortization of intangible assets is typically greater in the earlier periods following an acquisition

change in fair value of contingent consideration fiscal fiscal change change change in fair value of contingent consideration in connection with the acquisition of the lilly pulitzer brand and operations  we entered into a contingent consideration agreement with the sellers  whereby we will be obligated to pay certain contingent consideration amounts based on the achievement of certain performance criteria by our lilly pulitzer operating group  which may be as much as million in the aggregate over the four years subsequent to the acquisition 
in accordance with us gaap  we have recognized a liability in our consolidated balance sheets for the fair value of this liability 
this liability will increase in fair value as we approach the date of anticipated payment  resulting in a charge to our consolidated statements of operations 
additionally  the fair value of the contingent consideration will change in future periods to the extent that our assumptions regarding the probability of the payment of the contingent consideration  discount rates and other factors change as part of our periodic assessment of the fair value of the liability 
we anticipate that the change in fair value of contingent consideration due to the passage of time only will be approximately million in fiscal  however  this charge will change if we alter any assumptions related to fair value of the contingent consideration 
the change in assumptions could result in a material change to the amount included in the statement of operations for fiscal royalties and other operating income fiscal fiscal change change royalties and other operating income the increase in royalties and other operating income was primarily due to increased royalty income in tommy bahama  as sales reported by certain licensees increased and new licensees were added as well as the impact of a payment received related to the termination of the license for tommy bahama rum in fiscal

the six weeks of fiscal operating results were negatively impacted by approximately million of charges to cost of goods sold in lilly pulitzer resulting from the write up of acquired inventory from cost to fair value pursuant to the purchase method of accounting in connection with the sale of acquired inventory 
us gaap requires that all assets acquired as part of an acquisition  including inventory  be recorded at fair value  rather than cost 
this write up is recognized as an increase to cost of goods sold as the inventory is sold in the ordinary course of business 
the remaining write up included in our inventory at january  is approximately million  which we anticipate will be recognized as cost of goods sold  in addition to normal cost of goods sold amounts  during the first quarter of fiscal as the acquired inventory is sold 
additionally  the lilly pulitzer operating results included a million charge related to the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration

aside from the impact of lifo accounting charges  the transaction costs associated with the lilly pulitzer acquisition and the reduction in the environmental reserve  the reduced operating results were primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs resulting from the resumption of our incentive compensation program  which was suspended in fiscal and is tied to our financial performance

the 
table of contents effective tax rate in fiscal is not necessarily indicative of the effective tax rates in future periods  as the effective tax rate in the future will be higher if our earnings levels increase because the incremental earnings will likely be taxed at rates more closely aligned with statutory tax rates 
net earnings fiscal fiscal change earnings from continuing operations earnings from continuing operations per diluted common share net earnings from discontinued operations net earnings from discontinued operations per diluted common share net earnings net earnings per diluted common share weighted average common shares outstanding diluted the increase in earnings from continuing operations was primarily due to higher net sales with a higher gross margin resulting from a change in sales mix and higher royalty income  but partially offset by higher sg a  each as discussed above 
the increased results of the discontinued operations reflects the million after tax gain on the sale of substantially all the operations and assets of our former oxford apparel operating group  partially offset by the impact of fiscal including months of activity prior to the sale compared with months of activity in fiscal 
we do not anticipate significant earnings from the discontinued operations in future periods  except that we do anticipate earning commissions on inventory in transit during the first half of fiscal for inventory that was in process at the time of the transaction

for the ratio of debt to total capital  debt is defined as short term and long term debt  and total capital is defined as debt plus shareholders equity 
the change in the debt to total capital ratio from january  to january  was primarily a result of the gain on the sale of our oxford apparel operations and assets in fiscal  as well as earnings from continuing operations and discontinued operations during fiscal  which resulted in an increase in shareholders equity during the year 
our debt levels and ratio of debt to total capital in future periods may not be comparable to historical amounts due to the impact of the oxford apparel sale and as we continue to assess our capital structure

in fiscal  the primary use of cash for financing activities was the payment of dividends and the repayment of loans related to certain company owned life insurance policies 
in fiscal  cash flow from operations  borrowings under our us revolving credit agreement and the proceeds from the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of our senior secured

the change in cash flow from discontinued operations primarily reflects the million of proceeds from the sale of the discontinued operations during fiscal  but also reflects that the discontinued operations were reducing working capital requirements in fiscal and increasing working capital requirements in fiscal as of january   there were approximately million of net assets associated with the discontinued operations included in our consolidated balance sheet  including a million receivable for the cash held in escrow related to the oxford apparel sale 
we anticipate that these net assets  as well as certain commissions we will earn related to inventory in process as of the transaction date  will be converted into cash in the first half of fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal cash and cash equivalents on hand were million and million at january  and january   respectively 
the change in cash was primarily due to the cash flow activities discussed below 
operating activities the operating cash flows for fiscal and fiscal were primarily the result of earnings for the relevant period  adjusted for non cash activities such as depreciation  amortization  impairment and stock compensation expense as well as changes in our working capital accounts 
in fiscal  the significant change in working capital was a million reduction in inventories  while the significant changes in working capital in fiscal were decreases in inventories and accounts receivable  which increased cash flow from operations  and a decrease in current liabilities  which decreased cash flow from operations 
these changes reflect our emphasis in fiscal and fiscal on reducing our working capital investment 
investing activities during fiscal and fiscal  investing activities used million and million  respectively  of cash 
in both years  these investing activities primarily consisted of capital expenditures related to new retail stores and costs associated with our ongoing implementation of a new integrated financial system 
financing activities in fiscal  financing activities used million of cash  which was primarily used for a million reduction in debt 
in fiscal  cash flow from operations  borrowings under our us revolving credit agreement and the proceeds from the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of our senior secured notes were used to repurchase million aggregate principal amount of our senior unsecured notes  to pay million of dividends and to pay million of financing costs associated with the issuance of our senior secured notes in june in fiscal  financing activities used million of cash  which was primarily used for a million reduction in debt

discontinued operations the cash flows from discontinued operations reflect cash flow provided by or used in the activities of our discontinued operations 
the change in cash flow from discontinued operations reflects the impact of earnings and reductions in working capital levels during both fiscal and fiscal liquidity and capital resources the table below provides a description of our significant financing arrangements and the amounts outstanding under these financing arrangements in thousands as of january  outstanding million us secured revolving credit facility us revolving credit agreement  which is limited to a borrowing base consisting of specified percentages of eligible categories of assets  accrues interest  unused line fees and letter of credit fees based upon a pricing grid which is tied to average unused availability  requires interest payments monthly with principal due at maturity august and is secured by a first priority security interest in the accounts receivable other than royalty payments in respect of trademark licenses  inventory  investment property including the equity interests of certain subsidiaries  general intangibles other than trademarks  trade names and related rights  deposit accounts  intercompany obligations  equipment  goods  documents  contracts  books and records and other personal property of oxford industries  inc and substantially all of its domestic subsidiaries and a second priority security interest in those assets in which the holders of the senior secured notes have a first priority security interest million senior secured revolving credit facility uk revolving credit agreement  which accrues interest at the bank base rate plus  requires interest payments monthly with principal payable on demand and is collateralized by substantially all of the united kingdom assets of ben sherman senior secured notes senior secured notes  which accrue interest at an annual rate of effective interest rate of and require interest payments semi annually in january and july of each year  require payment of principal at maturity july  are subject to certain prepayment penalties  are secured by a first priority interest in all us registered trademarks and certain related rights and certain future acquired real property owned in fee simple of oxford industries  inc and substantially all of its consolidated domestic subsidiaries and a second priority security interest in those assets in which the lenders under the us revolving credit agreement have a first priority security interest  and are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries unamortized discount total debt short term debt and current maturities of long term debt long term debt  less current maturities 
table of contents to the extent cash flow needs exceed cash flow provided by our operations  we will have access  subject to their terms  to our lines of credit to provide funding for operating activities  capital expenditures and acquisitions  if any 
our credit facilities are also used to finance trade letters of credit for product purchases  which are drawn against our lines of credit at the time of shipment of the products and reduce the amounts available under our lines of credit and borrowing capacity under our credit facilities when issued 
as of january   approximately million of trade letters of credit and other limitations on availability in the aggregate were outstanding against the us revolving credit agreement and the us revolving credit agreement 
as of january   we had approximately million in unused availability under the us revolving credit agreement and approximately million in unused availability under the uk revolving credit agreement  subject to the respective limitations on borrowings set forth in the us revolving credit agreement  uk revolving credit agreement and the indenture for the senior secured notes 
covenants  other restrictions and prepayment penalties our credit facilities and senior secured notes are subject to a number of affirmative covenants regarding the delivery of financial information  compliance with law  maintenance of property  insurance and conduct of business 
also  our credit facilities and senior secured notes are subject to certain negative covenants or other restrictions including  among other things  limitations on our ability to i incur debt  ii guaranty certain obligations  iii incur liens  iv pay dividends to shareholders  v repurchase shares of our common stock  vi make investments  vii sell assets or stock of subsidiaries  viii acquire assets or businesses  ix merge or consolidate with other companies  or x prepay  retire  repurchase or redeem debt 
our us revolving credit agreement contains a financial covenant that applies if unused availability under the us revolving credit agreement for three consecutive days is less than the greater of i million or ii of the total revolving commitments 
in such case  our fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the us revolving credit agreement must not be less than to for the immediately preceding fiscal months for which financial statements have been delivered 
this financial covenant continues to apply until we have maintained unused availability under the us revolving credit agreement of more than the greater of i million or ii of the total revolving commitments for consecutive days 
additionally  pursuant to the indenture governing our senior secured notes  our ability to incur certain indebtedness or to make certain restricted payments  as defined in the indenture  is subject to our meeting certain conditions  including in each case the condition that our fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the indenture  not be less than to for the preceding four fiscal quarters on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the proposed indebtedness or restricted payment and  in the case of a restricted payment  the condition that the aggregate total of all restricted payments not exceed a certain allowable amount calculated pursuant to a formula set forth in the indenture 
restricted payments under the indenture include  without limitation  cash dividends to shareholders  repurchases of our capital stock  and certain investments 
we believe that the affirmative covenants  negative covenants  financial covenants and other restrictions are customary for those included in similar facilities and notes entered into at the time we entered into our agreements 
during fiscal and as of january   no financial covenant testing was required pursuant to our us revolving credit agreement as the minimum availability threshold was met at all times 
as of january   we were compliant with all covenants related to our credit facilities and senior secured notes 
at any time prior to july   we may redeem all or a portion of the senior secured notes  on not less than nor more than days prior notice  in amounts of  or an integral multiple of  in excess thereof  at a price equal to the greater of i of the aggregate 
table of contents principal amount of the senior secured notes to be redeemed  together with accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of redemption or ii as determined by an independent investment banker as prescribed under the indenture  the sum of the present values of of the principal amount of the senior secured notes being redeemed plus scheduled payments of interest not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption from the date of redemption to july  discounted to the redemption date on a semiannual basis assuming a day year consisting of twelve day months at the adjusted treasury rate as defined in the indenture plus basis points  together with accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of redemption 
on or after july   we may redeem all or a portion of the senior secured notes  on not less than nor more than days prior notice  in amounts of  or an integral multiple of  in excess thereof at the following redemption prices expressed as percentages of the principal amount  together with accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the redemption date  if redeemed during the month period beginning july of the years indicated below and thereafter other liquidity items we anticipate that we will be able to satisfy our ongoing cash requirements  which generally consist of working capital and other operating activity needs  capital expenditures primarily for the opening of additional retail stores  interest payments on our debt during fiscal and dividends  if any  primarily from positive cash flow from operations supplemented by cash on hand and borrowings under our lines of credit  if necessary 
our need for working capital is typically seasonal with the greatest requirements generally existing in the fall and spring of each year 
our capital needs will depend on many factors including our growth rate  the need to finance inventory levels and the success of our various products 
at maturity of the us revolving credit agreement and the senior secured notes or if the uk revolving credit agreement was required to be paid  we anticipate that we will be able to refinance the facilities and debt with terms available in the market at that time  which may or may not be as favorable as the terms of the current agreements 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations  as of january   by future period payments due by period less than year years years more than years total in thousands contractual obligations senior secured notes interest on senior secured notes us revolving credit agreement and us revolving credit agreement operating leases minimum royalty and advertising payments pursuant to royalty agreements letters of credit contingent purchase price consideration other total principal and interest amounts payable in future periods on our us revolving credit agreement and us revolving credit agreement have been excluded from the table above  as the amount that will be outstanding and interest rate during any fiscal year will be dependent upon future events which are not known at this time 
as of january   no amounts were outstanding under our us revolving credit agreement or our us revolving credit agreement 
amounts to be paid in future periods for real estate taxes  insurance  other operating expenses and contingent rent applicable to the properties pursuant to the respective operating leases have been excluded from the table above  as the amounts payable in future periods are generally not specified in the lease agreements and are dependent on factors which are not known at this time 
such amounts incurred in fiscal totaled approximately million 
amounts reflected in the table reflect the maximum amount payable pursuant to a contingent consideration arrangement associated with the lilly pulitzer acquisition  which totaled million as of january  amounts are payable if certain performance criteria related to the acquired business are met during the four years subsequent to acquisition 
as of january   our balance sheet reflects a liability of million associated with this arrangement  which reflects the fair value of the anticipated payments as of that date 
amounts totaling million of deferred compensation obligations and obligations related to the postretirement benefit portions of endorsement type split dollar life insurance policies  which are included in other non current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of january   have been excluded from the table above  due to the uncertainty of the timing of the payment of these obligations  which are generally at the discretion of the individual employees or upon the death of the former employee  respectively 
an environmental reserve liability of million  which is included in other non current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of january  and discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  has been excluded from the above table  as we were not contractually obligated to incur these costs as of january  and the timing of payment is uncertain 

table of contents non current deferred tax liabilities of million included in our consolidated balance sheet as of january  and discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report have been excluded from the above table  as deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax basis and book basis of assets and liabilities  which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the liabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts 
as the results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods  scheduling deferred income tax liabilities by period could be misleading 
our anticipated capital expenditures for fiscal  which are excluded from the table above as we are not contractually obligated to pay these amounts as of january   are expected to be approximately million 
these expenditures are expected to consist primarily of costs associated with opening new retail stores and certain technology initiatives 
dividend declaration on march   our board of directors approved a cash dividend of per share payable on april  to shareholders of record as of the close of business on april  although we have paid dividends in each quarter since we became a public company in july  we may discontinue or modify dividend payments at any time if we determine that other uses of our capital  including but not limited to  payment of outstanding debt  repurchases of outstanding shares or funding of future acquisitions  may be in our best interest  if our expectations of future cash flows and future cash needs outweigh the ability to pay a dividend  or if the terms of our credit facilities  the indenture for the senior secured notes  other debt instruments  contingent consideration arrangements or applicable law limit our ability to pay dividends 
we may borrow to fund dividends in the short term based on our expectation of operating cash flows in future periods subject to the terms and conditions of our credit facilities  the indenture for the senior secured notes or other debt instruments 
all cash flow from operations will not necessarily be paid out as dividends in all periods 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into agreements which meet the sec definition of an off balance sheet financing arrangement  other than operating leases  and have made no financial commitments to or guarantees with respect to any unconsolidated subsidiaries or special purpose entities 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to receivables  inventories  goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and other accrued expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that we have appropriately applied our critical accounting policies 
however  in the event that inappropriate assumptions or methods were used relating to the critical accounting policies below  our consolidated statements of operations could be misstated 

table of contents the detailed summary of significant accounting policies is included in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies  estimates and methods we use 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable our revenue primarily consists of wholesale  retail store  restaurant and e commerce sales 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in the normal course of business we offer certain discounts or allowances to our wholesale customers 
wholesale operations sales are recorded net of such discounts and allowances  as well as advertising support not specifically relating to the reimbursement for actual advertising expenses by our customers and provisions for estimated returns 
as certain allowances and other deductions are not finalized until the end of a season  program or other event which may not have occurred yet  we estimate such discounts and allowances on an ongoing basis 
significant considerations in determining our estimates for discounts  returns and allowances for wholesale customers include historical and current trends  agreements with customers  projected seasonal results  an evaluation of current economic conditions and retailer performance 
actual discounts and allowances to our wholesale customers have not differed materially from our estimates in prior periods 
as of january   our total reserves for discounts and allowances were approximately million and  therefore  if the allowances changed by it would have a pre tax impact of million on earnings from continuing operations 
in circumstances where we become aware of a specific customer inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve for bad debts is taken as a reduction to accounts receivable to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize estimated reserves for bad debts based on our historical collection experience  the financial condition of our customers  an evaluation of current economic conditions and anticipated trends  each of which is subjective and requires certain assumptions 
actual charges for uncollectible amounts have not differed materially from our estimates in prior periods 
as of january   our allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million  and therefore  if the allowance for doubtful accounts changed by it would have a pre tax impact of approximately million on earnings from continuing operations 
inventories  net for operating group reporting  inventory is carried at the lower of the first in  first out fifo method cost or market 
we continually evaluate the composition of our inventories for identification of distressed inventory 
in performing this evaluation we consider slow turning products  prior seasons fashion products and current levels of replenishment program products as compared to future sales estimates 
for wholesale inventory  we estimate the amount of goods that we will not be able to sell in the normal course of business and write down the value of these goods as necessary 
for retail inventory  we provide an allowance for shrinkage and goods expected to be sold below cost 
as the amount to be ultimately realized for the goods is not necessarily known at period end  we must utilize certain assumptions considering historical experience  the age of the inventory  inventory quantity  quality and mix  historical sales trends  future sales projections  consumer and retailer preferences  market trends and general economic conditions 
for consolidated financial reporting  approximately million of our inventories are valued at the lower of last in  first out lifo method cost or market after deducting the million lifo reserve as of january  approximately million of our inventories are valued at the lower 
table of contents of fifo cost or market as of january  as of january  and january   approximately and  respectively  of our inventories are accounted for using the lifo method 
generally  our inventories related to our domestic operations are valued at the lower of lifo cost or market and our inventories related to our international operations are valued at the lower of fifo cost or market 
lifo inventory accounting adjustments are not allocated to our operating groups as lifo inventory pools do not correspond to our operating group definitions 
lifo reserves are based on the producer price index as published by the united states department of labor 
we write down inventories valued at the lower of lifo cost or market when lifo exceeds market value 
we consider lifo accounting adjustments to not only include changes in the lifo reserve  but also changes in markdown reserves which are considered in lifo accounting 
for operating group reporting purposes included in note to our consolidated financial statements and in the results of operations in our management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this report  the impact of lifo accounting is included in corporate and other 
as of january   we had recorded a reserve of approximately million related to inventory on the lower of fifo cost or market method 
a change in the amount of markdowns for inventory valued on the lower of fifo cost or market method as of january  would have a pre tax impact of approximately million on earnings from continuing operations 
a change in the markdowns of our inventory valued at the lower of lifo cost or market method would not be expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements due to the existence of our significant lifo reserve of million  or of the fifo cost of the inventory  as of january  a change in inventory levels at the end of future years compared to inventory balances as of january  could result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as such a change may erode portions of our earlier base year layers for purposes of making our annual lifo computation 
the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires that assets and liabilities  including inventories  are recorded at fair value at acquisition 
in accordance with us gaap  the definition of fair value of inventories acquired generally will equal the expected sales price less certain costs associated with selling the inventory  which may exceed the actual cost of producing the acquired inventories 
in determining the fair value of the acquired inventory  we must make certain assumptions regarding costs incurred prior to acquisition for the acquired inventory  an appropriate profit allowance and estimates of the costs to sell the inventory 
such estimates involve significant uncertainty  and if we had made different assumptions  the impact on our consolidated financial statements could be significant 
in accordance with us gaap  we recognized a write up of inventories of approximately million above the cost of acquired inventories to fair value in connection with our acquisition of the lilly pulitzer brand and operations  which we included in our allocation of purchase price 
based on the inventory turn of the acquired inventories  approximately million of the write up was recognized as additional cost of goods sold in fiscal  and we anticipate that the remaining million of the write up  which is included in inventories  net in our consolidated balance sheet as of january   will be recognized as cost of goods sold during the first quarter of fiscal as the acquired inventory is sold in the ordinary course of business 
goodwill  net goodwill is recognized as the amount by which the cost to acquire a company or group of assets exceeds the fair value of assets acquired less any liabilities assumed at acquisition 
such goodwill is allocated to the respective reporting unit at the time of acquisition 
goodwill is not amortized but instead is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the goodwill might be impaired 
the evaluation of the recoverability of goodwill includes valuations of each applicable underlying business using fair value techniques and market comparables which may include a discounted cash flow analysis or an independent appraisal 
significant estimates  some of 
table of contents which require subjective judgment  included in such a valuation include future cash flow projections of the business  which are based on our future expectations for the business 
additionally  the discount rate used in this analysis is an estimate of the risk adjusted market based cost of capital 
as part of our annual impairment test  we use certain indicators to evaluate whether the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable  such as i negative operating cash flow or a forecast that demonstrates declines in the operating cash flow of a reporting unit or the inability of a reporting unit to improve its operations to appropriate levels  ii a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of an entity and iii whether the book value of our shareholders equity exceeds our market capitalization 
a decrease in our market capitalization resulting from a decrease in our stock price  or a negative long term performance outlook  could cause the carrying value of our reporting units to exceed their fair values  which may result in an impairment loss 
if our analysis indicates an impairment of goodwill balances  the impairment is recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  the price of our common stock declined significantly  particularly late in the third quarter and throughout the fourth quarter 
as of january   the carrying value of our net assets exceeded the fair value of our net assets  measured as market capitalization of our outstanding common stock  plus a reasonable control premium  and the fair value of our outstanding debt 
the analysis comparing our enterprise fair value to our book value along with consideration of the actual and projected results of our reporting units indicated that it was appropriate to write off all goodwill in tommy bahama and ben sherman in fiscal  resulting in a total goodwill impairment charge of approximately million 
additionally  all goodwill related to oxford apparel of million was written off in fiscal  which is included in discontinued operations in our statements of operations 
no impairment of goodwill was recognized in fiscal or fiscal as a result of our acquisition of the lilly pulitzer brand and operations  we allocated approximately million of goodwill based on our preliminary fair value allocation 
the amount of goodwill ultimately recognized may change in the future if we revise our fair value allocation during the allocation period 
intangible assets  net intangible assets included in our consolidated balance sheet as of january  totaled approximately million  which includes approximately million of customer relationships with finite lives and million of trademarks with indefinite lives 
at acquisition  we estimate and record the fair value of purchased intangible assets  which primarily consist of trademarks and customer relationships 
the fair values and useful lives of these intangible assets are estimated based on management assessment as well as independent third party appraisals in some cases 
such valuation may include a discounted cash flow analysis of anticipated revenues or cost savings resulting from the acquired intangible asset using an estimate of a risk adjusted market based cost of capital as the discount rate 
amortization of intangible assets with finite lives  which primarily consist of customer relationships  is recognized over their estimated useful lives using a method of amortization that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise realized 
we amortize our intangible assets with finite lives for periods of up to years 
the determination of an appropriate useful life for amortization is based on our plans for the intangible asset as well as factors outside of our control 
intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment periodically if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if expected future undiscounted cash flows from operations are less than their carrying amounts  an asset is determined to be impaired and a loss is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the 
table of contents asset exceeds its fair value 
amortization related to intangible assets with finite lives totaled million during fiscal and is anticipated to be approximately million in fiscal trademarks with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the intangible asset might be impaired 
the evaluation of the recoverability of trademarks with indefinite lives includes valuations based on a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing the relief from royalty method  among other considerations 
this approach is dependent upon a number of uncertain factors  including estimates of future net sales  growth rates  royalty rates for the trademarks and discount rates 
such estimates involve significant uncertainty  and if our plans or anticipated results change  the impact on our financial statements could be significant 
if this analysis indicates an impairment of a trademark with an indefinite useful life  the amount of the impairment is recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on the amount that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
as a result of the impact of the difficult economic conditions on the operations of tommy bahama and ben sherman as well as the required use of higher discount rates than used in prior years  we recognized approximately million of impairment charges related to intangible assets in fiscal charges of million  million and million were recognized in tommy bahama  ben sherman and lanier clothes  respectively 
the fiscal impairment charges related to intangible assets resulted in a tax benefit in our consolidated statements of operations 
in fiscal and fiscal  no impairment charges related to intangible assets were recognized 
as a result of our acquisition of the lilly pulitzer brand and operations  we recognized million of intangible assets including trademarks and customer relationships in our consolidated balance sheet at acquisition using the methodology outlined above 
these acquired intangible assets consist of million of indefinite lived trademarks and million of definite lived customer relationships 
the amount of intangible assets ultimately recognized may change in the future if we revise our fair value allocation during the allocation period 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes for a company with global operations 
the ultimate tax outcome may be uncertain for many transactions 
our provisions are based on federal and projected state statutory rates and take into account our assessment of permanent book tax differences  income tax credits and uncertain tax positions 
we estimate the effective tax rate for the full fiscal year and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated annual rate 
as the fiscal year progresses  the estimate is refined based upon actual events and earnings loss by jurisdiction and to reflect changes in our judgment of the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions 
this estimation process periodically results in a change to the expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision reflects the expected annual rate 
income tax expense may also be adjusted for discrete events occurring during the year  such as the enactment of tax rate changes or changes in uncertain tax positions  which are reflected in the quarter that the changes occur 
business combinations we account for our business combinations using the purchase method of accounting 
the cost of each acquired business is allocated to the individual tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed or incurred as a result of the acquisition based on their estimated fair values 
the assessment of the estimated fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires us to make certain assumptions regarding the use of the acquired assets  anticipated cash flows  probabilities of cash flows  
table of contents discount rates and other factors 
the methodology of determining the acquired fair value for inventories  goodwill and intangible assets are each discussed in more detail above 
as part of our acquisition of the lilly pulitzer brand and operations  we have entered into certain contingent consideration arrangements with the sellers  whereby we will owe the sellers contingent consideration if certain performance criteria related to the acquired business are attained 
the purchase method of accounting requires that this contingent consideration is recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition and adjusted periodically based on our estimates of fair value 
such valuation requires assumptions regarding anticipated cash flows  probabilities of cash flows  discount rates and other factors 
for the lilly pulitzer acquisition  the total contingent consideration that we may be required to pay totals million  however  our estimate on the date of acquisition of the fair value of this amount is approximately million  which reflects the discounted fair value of the anticipated payments 
this estimate of fair value considers each of the assumptions discussed above 
such estimates involve significant uncertainty  and we expect that during the one year allocation period and subsequent to the allocation period  we will gain better knowledge about the uncertainties  and we expect that it is very likely that we will revise our estimate of the fair value of this contingent consideration in future periods 
additionally  the fair value will change each period with the recognition of interest expense resulting from the passage of time at the applicable discount rate as we approach the payment dates of the contingent consideration 
if our plans or the anticipated results of the acquired business change  the impact on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations could be significant 
based on our current assumptions related to the contingent consideration valuation  we anticipate that the change in fair value associated with the contingent consideration arrangement will be approximately million during fiscal assuming there are no other changes to our assumptions related to the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement 
the change in fair value of the contingent consideration in fiscal and subsequent periods could change significantly if our assumptions regarding the valuation of the contingent consideration change during fiscal we anticipate that the allocation of purchase price will be revised during the allocation period as necessary when  and if  information becomes available to revise the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
to the extent information to revise the allocation becomes available during the allocation period the allocation of the purchase price will be adjusted 
should information become available after the allocation period indicating that adjustments to the allocation are appropriate  those adjustments will be included in operating results 
the allocation period will not exceed one year from the date of the acquisition 
as we have not completed our valuation of assets and liabilities acquired  including the valuation of the contingent consideration  we have not completed the purchase price allocation related to our december  acquisition of lilly pulitzer as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
for the valuation of each of the acquired assets  including receivables  inventories  fixed assets  intangible assets  other assets and goodwill  and the acquired liabilities  including accounts payable  accrued expenses  contingent consideration and any other liabilities  the assumptions that we made regarding the valuation of these assets could differ significantly from the assumptions made by other parties 
the use of different assumptions could result in materially different valuations for the acquired assets and liabilities assumed  which would impact the opening balance sheet as well as the results of operations for future periods 
seasonality although our various product lines are sold on a year round basis  the demand for specific products or styles may be seasonal 
for example  the demand for tommy bahama and lilly pulitzer products in our principal markets is generally higher in the spring season and lower in the fall season 

table of contents typically  our wholesale products are sold prior to each of the retail selling seasons  including spring  summer  fall and holiday 
as the timing of product shipments and other events affecting the retail business may vary  we do not believe that results for any particular quarter are necessarily indicative of results for the full fiscal year 
in addition  we do not believe that the fiscal distribution of net sales and operating income is necessarily indicative of the expected distribution in future years as the information below does not reflect a full year operations of lilly pulitzer and individual quarters may be impacted by certain unusual or non recurring items  economic conditions or other factors 
the following table presents the percentage of net sales and operating income by quarter unaudited for fiscal first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter net sales operating income item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our indebtedness  which could impact our financial condition and results of operations in future periods 
our objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow  primarily through a mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt 
this assessment also considers our need for flexibility in our borrowing arrangements resulting from the seasonality of our business  among other factors 
we continuously monitor interest rates to consider the sources and terms of our borrowing facilities in order to determine whether we have achieved our interest rate management objectives 
none of our debt was entered into for speculative purposes 
also  we generally do not engage in hedging activities with respect to our interest rate risk and generally do not enter into such any such hedging transactions on a speculative basis 
as of january   we had no debt outstanding which was subject to variable interest rates  although we did have debt subject to variable interest rates outstanding at various times during fiscal our lines of credit  which are based on variable interest rates  provide the necessary borrowing flexibility we require due to the seasonality of our business and our need to fund certain product purchases with trade letters of credit 
to the extent that the amounts outstanding under our variable rate lines of credit change  our exposure to changes in interest rates would also change 
we do not believe that borrowings and interest rates  and therefore interest expense  for fiscal are necessarily indicative of borrowings in future periods given our divestiture and acquisition activities in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as well as other factors 
after considering the impact of these transactions  we do not anticipate having a significant amount of borrowings outstanding under our variable rate lines of credits during fiscal  however  we may have amounts outstanding under our variable rate lines of credits at certain times during fiscal based on our seasonal working capital requirements or if anticipated cash requirements exceed our current expectations 
if we make changes to our capital structure or acquire additional businesses in the future  such transactions could materially impact our borrowing levels on our variable rate lines of credit and  thus  interest expense in future periods as well 
as of january   we had approximately million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate debt outstanding  consisting of our senior secured notes  which have an effective interest rate of and mature in july such fixed rate debt may result in higher interest expense than could be obtained under variable interest rate arrangements in certain periods  but is primarily intended to provide long term financing of our capital structure and minimize our exposure to increases in interest rates 
a change in the market interest rate impacts the fair value of our fixed rate 
table of contents debt but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
even if we have a substantial amount of cash on hand  our ability to reduce the amount of our senior secured notes outstanding may be limited until july  without a significant costs 
foreign currency risk to the extent that we have assets and liabilities  as well as operations  denominated in foreign currencies that are not hedged  we are subject to foreign currency transaction and translation gains and losses 
we view our foreign investments as long term and  as a result  we generally do not hedge such foreign investments 
we do not hold or issue any derivative financial instruments related to foreign currency exposure for speculative purposes 
we receive united states dollars for most of our product sales 
however  approximately of our net sales for fiscal were denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
these sales primarily relate to ben sherman sales in the united kingdom and europe 
a strengthening united states dollar could result in lower levels of sales and earnings in our consolidated statements of operations in future periods  although the sales in foreign currencies could be equal to or greater than amounts as previously reported 
based on our net sales during fiscal denominated in foreign currencies  if the united states dollar had been stronger against the british pound we would have experienced a decrease in net sales of approximately million  but the impact on operating income would have been immaterial 
substantially all of our inventory purchases  including goods for operations in the united kingdom  from contract manufacturers throughout the world are denominated in united states dollars 
purchase prices for our products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers  which may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods sold in the future 
additionally  to the extent that the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the currency that the inventory will be sold in changes  the gross margins of those businesses could be impacted significantly 
we may from time to time purchase short term foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge against changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and at january   we were a party to approximately million of such contracts that were unsettled 
these contracts primarily consist of agreements to purchase us dollars and sell euro 
during fiscal  foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding did not exceed million at any time 
when such contracts are outstanding  the contracts are marked to market with the offset being recognized in other comprehensive income or our consolidated statement of operations if the transaction does or does not  respectively  qualify as a hedge in accordance with us gaap 
commodity and inflation risk we are affected by inflation and changing prices primarily through the purchase of raw materials and finished goods and increased operating costs to the extent that any such fluctuations are not reflected by adjustments in the selling prices of our products 
inflation deflation risks are managed by each operating group through selective price increases when possible  productivity improvements and cost containment initiatives 
we do not enter into significant long term sales or purchase contracts  and we do not engage in hedging activities with respect to such risk 
based on purchases and negotiations for inventory purchases thus far in fiscal  it appears that our gross margins will be impacted by pricing pressures on raw materials  fuel  transportation and other costs necessary for the production and sourcing of apparel products during fiscal compared to fiscal
