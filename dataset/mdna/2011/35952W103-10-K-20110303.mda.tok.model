item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
manufacturing we manufacture and assemble a majority of our products at our facilities in santa ana  california  union city  indiana  kitchener  canada  beccar  argentina and cherasco  italy and to a lesser extent at some of our other international facilities 
current manufacturing operations consist primarily of mechanical assembly and light machining 
we rely on outside suppliers for parts and components and obtain components for products from a variety of domestic and foreign automotive and electronics suppliers  die casters  stamping operations  specialized diaphragm manufacturers and machine shops 
during  one supplier represented of the consolidated raw materials and services 
during  one supplier represented of the consolidated raw materials and services 
during  no suppliers represented more than of the consolidated purchases of raw materials and services 
material costs and machined die cast aluminum parts represent the major components of our cost of sales 
coordination with suppliers for quality control and timely shipments is a high priority to maximize inventory management 
we use a computerized material requirement planning system to schedule material flow and balance the competing demands of timely shipments  productivity and inventory management 
our manufacturing facilities in california  canada  argentina and italy are iso certified 
research and development our research and development programs provide the technical capabilities that are required for the development of systems and products that support the use of gaseous fuels in internal combustion engines 
our research and development is focused on fuel delivery and electronic control systems and products for motor vehicles  engines  forklifts  stationary engines and small industrial engines 
in  we expanded our research and development facility in italy to continue to serve our customers with new products and capabilities 
our research and development expenditures were approximately million  million  million in   and  respectively 
competition our key competitors in gaseous fuel delivery products  accessory components and engine conversions markets include landi group  omvl  srl and srl tartarini  srl located in europe  aisan industry co 
ltd 
and nikki company ltd 
in japan 
these companies  together with us  account for a majority of the world market for alternative fuel products and services 
in the future  we may face competition from traditional automotive component suppliers  such as the bosch group  delphi corporation  siemens vdo automotive ag and visteon corporation  and from motor vehicle oems that develop fuel systems internally 
industry participants compete on price  product performance and customer support 
product certification we must obtain emission compliance certification from the environmental protection agency to sell certain of our products in the united states  receive certification from the california air resources board to sell certain products in california and meet european standards for emission regulations in europe 
each car  truck or van sold in each of these markets must be certified before it can be introduced into commerce  and its products must meet component  subsystem and system level durability  emission  refueling and various idle tests 
we have also obtained international emissions compliance certification in argentina  australia  brazil  canada  chile  europe  russia  mexico and thailand 
we strive to meet stringent industry standards set by various regulatory bodies 

table of contents approvals enhance the acceptability of our products in the worldwide marketplace 
many foreign countries also accept these agency approvals as satisfying the approval for sale requirements in their markets 
employees as of december   we employed approximately  persons  excluding those employed by our unconsolidated affiliates in india 
of these employees  were employed in impco operations  of which are foreign employees  and approximately  were employed in brc operations  all of which are foreign employees 
employees in italy  the netherlands and argentina are represented by a collective bargaining agreement 
personnel employed by our foreign subsidiaries are often subject to national labor contracts 
we consider our relations with our employees and unions to be good 
intellectual property we currently rely primarily on patent and trade secret laws to protect our intellectual property 
we currently have approximately one hundred patents registered in countries located in north america  europe  and asia 
we do not expect the expiration of our patents to have a material effect on our revenue 
we also rely on a combination of trademark  trade secret and other intellectual property laws and various contract rights to protect our proprietary rights 
however  we cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights provide sufficient protection from competition 
we believe that our intellectual property protected by copyright and trademark protection is less significant than our intellectual property protected by patents 
third parties may claim that our products and systems infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights 
identifying third party patent rights can be particularly difficult  especially since patent applications are not published until months after their filing dates 
if a competitor were to challenge our patents  or assert that our products or processes infringe its patent or other intellectual property rights  we could incur substantial litigation costs  be forced to design around their patents  pay substantial damages or even be forced to cease our operations  any of which could be expensive and or have an adverse effect on our operating results 
third party infringement claims  regardless of their outcome  would not only consume our financial resources  but also would divert the time and effort of our management and could result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of the affected products or services until resolution of the litigation 

table of contents item a 
risk factors 
the success of our recent investments in the automotive alternative fuel transportation business in the united states is contingent on the growth of the gaseous alternative fuel industry in the united states 
we recently expanded our automotive alternative fuel transportation activities in the united states by acquiring two businesses 
the return on our investments is dependent among other factors on the expansion of the united states market for vehicles that operate on gaseous alternative fuels 
if this market does not expand  the revenues and profits generated by these investments may not justify the purchase prices that we paid for them 
reduced consumer or corporate spending due to weakness in the financial markets and uncertainties in the economy  domestically and internationally  may materially and adversely affect our revenue  operating results and cash flows 
we depend on demand from the consumer  oem  contract manufacturing  industrial  automotive and other markets we serve for the end market applications that use our products and services 
all of these markets have been  and may continue to be  affected by the recent instability in global financial markets that have caused extreme economic disruption 
reductions in consumer or corporate demand for our products and services as a result of uncertain conditions in the macroeconomic environment  such as volatile energy prices  inflation  fluctuations in interest rates  difficulty securing credit  extreme volatility in security prices  diminished liquidity  mortgage failures  or other economic factors  may materially and adversely affect our revenue  operating results and cash flows 
negative economic conditions may also materially impact our customers  suppliers and other parties with which we do business 
economic and financial market conditions that adversely affect our customers may cause them to terminate existing purchase orders  reduce the volume of products they purchase from us in the future or seek price concessions 
in connection with the sale of products  we normally do not require collateral as security for customer receivables and do not purchase credit insurance 
we may have significant balances owing from customers who operate in cyclical industries or who may not be able to secure sufficient credit in order to honor their obligations to us 
failure to collect a significant portion of amounts due on those receivables could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
adverse economic and financial market conditions may also cause our suppliers to be unable to provide materials and components to us or may cause suppliers to make changes in the credit terms they extend to us  such as shortening the required payment period for our amounts owing them or reducing the maximum amount of trade credit available to us 
while we have not yet experienced changes of this type  they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and financial markets conditions  we may be unable to effectively plan for  and respond to  those changes  and we could be materially and adversely affected 
we maintain a significant investment in inventory and have recently made significant investments in the expansion of our operations to meet recent increases in demand for our product without long term contracts with customers 
a decline in our customers purchases would lead to a decline in our revenue and could result in a decrease in our operating results and cash flows 
we do not have long term contracts with our customers 
generally  our product sales are made on a purchase order basis  which allows our customers to reduce or discontinue their purchases from us 
accordingly  we cannot predict the timing  frequency or size of our future customer orders 
our ability to accurately forecast our sales is further complicated by the current global economic and financial uncertainty 
we maintain significant inventories at brc group  the principal operating company in our transportation division  in an effort to ensure that our european transportation customers have a reliable source of supply 
our total inventory at december  was million  a decrease of million compared to our total inventory at december   nonetheless  if we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our customers and accurately forecast our customer demands  our existing and potential customers may not place orders with us  which would 
table of contents decrease our revenue  and we may accumulate significant inventories of products that we will be unable to sell which may result in a significant decline in the value of our inventory 
as a result  our revenue  gross profit and other operating results and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  during  we expanded our operational capacity  including opening new facilities in italy  to address increased demand for our fuel systems components and systems  and in  we have increased substantially our investment in research and development 
we may continue to make significant investments in our business without any guarantees or long term commitments from our customers that they will continue to purchase our components and systems with the same timing  frequency and size as we expect 
as a result  if there is insufficient demand for our components and systems  we may not recover the costs of any increased investment in our operations  which could have a material  adverse effect on our financial position  liquidity and results of operations 
the development of our business is dependent on the availability of gaseous fueling infrastructure many countries  including the united states  currently have limited or no infrastructure to deliver natural gas and propane to consumers 
in the united states  alternative fuels such as natural gas currently cannot be readily obtained by consumers for motor vehicle use  and only a small percentage of motor vehicles manufactured for the united states are equipped to use alternative fuels 
users of gaseous fuel vehicles may not be able to obtain fuel conveniently and affordably  which may adversely affect the demand for our products and services 
we cannot assure you that the united states or global market for gaseous fuel engines will expand broadly or  if it does  that it will result in increased sales of our fuel system products 
an expansion of oem offering of gaseous fuel vehicles employing internally developed oem technology would likely result in a decrease in our revenue and profit margins 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the sale of gaseous fuel systems and components to automobile oems 
an expansion in the offering of oem gaseous fuel vehicles employing internally developed oem technology could reduce demand for our systems and components and would likely have a negative impact on our revenue and profits 
we currently face  and will continue to face  significant competition  which could materially and adversely affect us 
we currently compete with companies that manufacture products to convert liquid fueled internal combustion engines to gaseous fuels 
our competitors in the future may have greater name recognition  larger customer bases  broader global reach and a wider array of product lines  as well as greater financial resources and access to capital than we have 
we are also subject to competition from other alternative fuels and alternative fuel technologies  including ethanol  electric and hybrid electric and fuel cells  and we cannot assure you that such technologies will not be favored over gaseous fuel technologies in the future 
we also cannot assure you that our competitors will not create new and improved innovative gaseous fuel technologies 
increases in the market for alternative fuel vehicles may cause automobile or engine manufacturers to develop and produce their own fuel conversion or fuel management equipment rather than purchasing the equipment from suppliers such as us or to employ competing technologies 
further  greater acceptance of alternative fuel engines may result in new competitors 
should any of these events occur  either alone or in combination  the total potential demand for  and pricing of  our products could be negatively affected and cause us to lose business  which could materially and adversely affect us 
new technologies could render our existing products obsolete and materially and adversely affect us 
new developments in technology may negatively affect the development or sale of some or all of our products or make our products obsolete 
our inability to enhance existing products in a timely manner or to develop and introduce new products that incorporate new technologies  conform to increasingly stringent 
table of contents emission standards and performance requirements  and achieve market acceptance in a timely manner could negatively impact our competitive position and may materially and adversely affect us 
new product development or modification is costly  involves significant research  development  time and expense and may not necessarily result in the successful commercialization of any new products 
fluctuation in oil or natural gas prices may result in a decline in the demand for our products and services  which would materially and adversely affect our revenue  operating results and cash flows 
we believe that our sales in recent years have been favorably impacted by changes in consumer demand prompted by rising oil prices and concern over potential increases in oil prices 
conversely  when oil prices decrease and remain low or continue to decrease  it may result in a decline of the demand for our products and services 
in addition  volatility in the price of natural gas may have an equal though opposite impact on the demand for our products and services 
the potential decline in the demand for our products and services caused by these price fluctuations could materially and adversely affect our revenue  operating results and cash flows 
our business is directly and significantly affected by regulations relating to reducing vehicle emissions 
if current regulations are repealed or if the implementation of current regulations is suspended or delayed  our revenue  operating results and cash flows may decrease significantly 
if regulations relating to vehicle emissions are amended in a manner that may allow for more lenient standards  or if the implementation of such currently existing standards is delayed or suspended  the demand for our products and services could diminish  and our revenue  operating results and cash flows could decrease significantly 
in addition  demand for our products and services may be adversely affected by the perception that emission regulations will be suspended or delayed 
accordingly  we rely on stricter emissions regulations  the adoption of which are out of our control and cannot be assured  to stimulate our growth 
we are subject to governmental certification requirements and other regulations  and more stringent regulations in the future may impair our ability to market our products 
we must obtain product certification from governmental agencies  such as the environmental protection agency and the california air resources board  to sell certain of our products in the united states and must obtain other product certification requirements in europe and other regions 
a significant portion of our future revenue will depend upon sales of fuel management products that are certified to meet existing and future air quality and energy standards 
we cannot assure you that our products will meet these standards in the future 
we incur significant research and developments costs to ensure that our products comply with emissions standards and meet certification requirements in the countries where our products are sold 
our failure to comply with certification requirements could result in the recall of our products and civil or criminal penalties 
any new government regulation that affects our alternative fuel technologies  whether at the foreign  federal  state  or local level  including any regulations relating to installation and service of these systems  may increase our costs and the price of our systems and adversely affect the effectiveness of the related technologies 
as a result  these regulations could materially and adversely affect us 
changes in tax policies and governmental incentives may reduce or eliminate the economic benefits that make our products attractive to consumers  which could materially and adversely affect us 
in some jurisdictions and from time to time  government authorities may provide tax benefits and incentives for clean air vehicles  including tax credits  rebates and reductions in applicable tax rates 
in certain of our markets  these benefits extend to vehicles powered by our systems and create economic benefits for our customers 
changes in these tax benefits or incentives  such as the expiration at the end of of the italian government s economic incentives for the purchase of new dual fuel consumer automobiles  may reduce or eliminate the economic benefits that make our products attractive to customers  which could materially and 
table of contents adversely affect us 
government authorities in some countries may from time to time use fuel prices as an instrument of fiscal policy and taxation may vary for different types of fuels  including gaseous fuels 
changes in taxation can affect the retail prices for alternative fuels which can negatively impact the attractiveness of our products 
some of our foreign subsidiaries have done  and may continue to do  business in countries subject to us sanctions and embargoes  including iran  and we have limited managerial oversight over those activities 
some of our foreign subsidiaries sell fuel delivery systems  related parts and accessories to customers in iran  a country that is currently subject to sanctions and embargoes imposed by the us government and the united nations and a country identified by the us government as a terrorist sponsoring state 
some of our foreign subsidiaries may in the future make sales to other countries subject to sanctions and embargoes imposed by the us government 
although these sanctions and embargoes do not prohibit our foreign subsidiaries from selling products and providing services in iran and these other countries  they do prohibit fuel systems and our domestic subsidiaries  as well as employees of our foreign subsidiaries who are us citizens  from participating in  approving or otherwise facilitating any aspect of the business activities in iran and these other countries 
the constraints on our ability to have us persons  including our senior management  provide managerial oversight and supervision over business activities in iran and other us sanctioned countries may negatively affect the financial or operating performance of such activities 
we believe we have procedures in place to conduct these activities in compliance with applicable us laws 
our foreign subsidiaries may also make sales to countries subject to sanctions and embargoes imposed by the european union 
these eu sanctions  as well as eu sanctions  are complex 
we believe we have procedures in place to conduct foreign operations without violating eu sanctions 
however  if we fail to comply with us laws or us sanctions in our foreign operations  we could be subject to material fines and penalties and incur damage to our reputation  which may lead to a reduction in the market price of our common stock 
in addition  our foreign subsidiaries activities in iran and other us or us sanctioned countries could reduce demand for our common stock among certain of our investors for political reasons 
recent iranian sanction laws and regulations have adversely affected our revenues and may cause us other adverse consequences 
on june   the united nations security council by resolution voted to impose a new and expanded round of sanctions against iran 
on july   the european union implemented the un resolution 
on july   president obama signed into law the new comprehensive iran sanctions and accountability and divestment act of moreover  in response to the un resolution  other countries around the world have also strengthened and expended laws and regulations imposing sanctions against iran 
this new and expanded round of laws and regulations imposing sanctions on iran has adversely impacted our revenues derived from iran 
we can offer no assurance that any further expansion of iranian sanctions will not further adversely affect our revenues and cause us other adverse consequences 
currency exchange rate fluctuations and devaluations may have a material adverse effect on our revenue and overall financial results 
for the year ended december   non us operations accounted for approximately of our revenue 
most revenues and expenses of our non us operations are in local currency 
our financial statements are presented in us dollars  therefore  gains and losses on the conversion of foreign currency denominated expenses into us dollars could cause fluctuations in our operating results  and fluctuating exchange rates could cause significantly reduced revenue and gross margins from non us dollar denominated revenue  which could materially and adversely affect our overall financial results 
also  for the year ended december   euro denominated revenue accounted for approximately of our total revenue  therefore a substantial appreciation in the rate of exchange of the us dollar against the euro could have a significant adverse affect on our financial results 

table of contents we currently do not engage in financial hedging against these risks and may not in the future be able to hedge against these risks 
adverse currency fluctuations may hinder our ability to economically procure key materials and services from overseas vendors and suppliers and may adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 
because of our significant operations outside of the united states  we engage in business relationships and transactions that involve many different currencies 
exchange rates between the us dollar and the local currencies in these foreign locations where we do business can vary unpredictably 
these variations may have an effect on the prices we pay for key materials and services from overseas vendors in our functional currencies under agreements that are priced in local currencies 
if the rate of the us dollar depreciates against local currencies  our effective costs for such materials and services would increase  adversely affecting our operating results and cash flows 
we engage in related party transactions  which could result in a conflict of interest involving our management 
we have engaged in the past  and continue to engage  in a significant number of related party transactions  specifically between the company s foreign subsidiaries and members of the family of our chief executive officer  director and largest stockholder  his brother pier antonio costamagna one of our executive officers who is managing director of brc group  the principal operating company in our transportation division  and director of mechanical engineering of mtm  srl  a wholly owned subsidiary of brc  companies in which our chief executive officer s family has controlling or other ownership interests  companies that our employees and service providers own in whole or in part and former owners of the companies we have purchased in foreign countries 
many of these relationships stem from the fact that when we acquired these foreign subsidiaries they were privately owned and such transactions are not uncommon in privately owned companies 
our board  its audit committee and its nominating and corporate governance committee seek to review on an ongoing basis related party transactions as well as new transactions which may be proposed for various issues related to the effect on our business 
we cannot assure you that the terms of the transactions with these various related parties are on terms as favorable to us as those that could have been obtained in arm s length transactions with third parties  or that the existing policies and procedures are sufficient to identify and completely address conflicts of interest that may arise 
related party transactions could result in related parties receiving more favorable treatment than an unaffiliated third party would receive  although these parties may provide goods or services that are not readily available elsewhere in some situations 
in addition  related party transactions present difficult conflicts of interest  could result in significant and minor disadvantages to our company and may impair investor confidence  which could materially and adversely affect us 
related party transactions could also cause us to become materially dependent on related parties in the ongoing conduct of our business  and related parties may be motivated by personal interests to pursue courses of action that are not necessarily in the best interests of our company and our stockholders 
we have a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets that may become impaired  which could impact our results of operations 
approximately million  or  of our total assets at december  were net intangible assets  including technology  customer relationships and trade name  and approximately million  or  of our total assets at december  were goodwill that relates to our acquisitions 
we amortize the intangible assets  with the exception of goodwill  based on our estimate of their remaining useful lives and their values at the time of acquisition 
we are required to test goodwill for impairment at least on an annual basis  or earlier if we determine it may be impaired due to change in circumstances 
we are required to test the other intangible assets with definite useful lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the intangible assets may not be recoverable 
if impairment exists in any of these assets  we are required to write down the related asset to its estimated recoverable value as of the measurement date 
such impairment write downs may significantly impact our results of operations 

table of contents we are dependent on certain key customers  and the loss of one or more customers could have a material adverse effect on us 
a substantial portion of our business results from revenues from key customers 
for the year ended december   one customer represented of our consolidated revenues 
in the year ended december   two customers represented and of our consolidated revenues  respectively 
in the year ended december   one customer represented of our consolidated revenues 
revenues from our top ten customers during the years ended december   and accounted for approximately  and of our consolidated revenues  respectively 
if one or more of these key customers were to reduce their orders from us substantially  we would suffer a decline in revenue  which may materially and adversely affect us 
we may not be able to successfully integrate our recently acquired business or any future acquired businesses into our existing worldwide business without substantial expenses  delays or other operational or financial problems 
during we acquired the argentina companies distribuidora shopping sa tomasetto achille  sa  and the teleflex systems business 
during  we acquired productive concepts international llc s alternative fuel business and evotek llc and as a part of our business strategy we may seek to acquire additional businesses  technologies or products in the future 
we cannot assure you that any acquisition or any future transaction we complete will result in long term benefits to us or our stockholders or that our management will be able to integrate or manage the acquired business effectively  efficiently and in a timely manner 
we could also incur unanticipated expenses or losses in connection with any acquisition or future transaction 
acquisitions entail numerous risks  including difficulties associated with the integration of operations  technologies  products and personnel that  if realized  could harm our operating results 
risks related to potential acquisitions include  but are not limited to difficulties in combining previously separate businesses into a single unit  inability to overcome differences in foreign business practices  accounting practices  customs and importation regulations  language and other barriers in connection with the acquisition of foreign companies  substantial diversion of management s time and attention from day to day business when evaluating and negotiating such transactions and then integrating an acquired business  discovery  after completion of the acquisition  of liabilities assumed from the acquired business or of assets acquired that are not realizable  costs and delays in implementing  and the potential difficulty in maintaining  uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  including the integration of different information systems  the presence or absence of adequate internal controls and or significant fraud in the financial systems of acquired companies  and failure to achieve anticipated benefits  such as cost savings and revenue enhancements 
we face risks associated with marketing  distributing  and servicing our products internationally 
in addition to our operations in the united states  we currently operate in canada  italy  australia  india  pakistan  the netherlands  japan  brazil  argentina and venezuela  and market our products and technologies in other international markets  including both industrialized and developing countries

table of contents within the united states and canada  and the remaining and  respectively  was derived from sales in asia  europe  latin america and the middle east 
additionally  approximately of our employees and of our approximately distributors and dealers worldwide are located outside the united states 
our combined international operations are subject to various risks common to international activities  such as the following our ability to maintain good relations with our overseas employees  suppliers  distributors and customers to collect amounts owed from our overseas customers  expenses and administrative difficulties associated with maintaining a significant labor force outside the united states  including  without limitation  the need to comply with employment and tax laws and to adhere to the terms of real property leases and other financing arrangements in foreign nations  exposure to currency fluctuations  potential difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights  complying with a wide variety of laws and regulations  including product certification  environmental  and import and export laws  the challenges of operating in disparate geographies and cultures  political and economic instability  and adverse tax consequences  including  without limitation  restrictions on our ability to repatriate dividends from our subsidiaries 
we depend on a limited number of third party suppliers for key materials and components for our products 
we have established relationships with third party suppliers that provide materials and components for our products 
a supplier s failure to supply materials or components in a timely manner or to supply materials and components that meet our quality  quantity or cost requirements  combined with a delay in our ability to obtain substitute sources for these materials and components in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us  would harm our ability to manufacture our products effectively  or would significantly increase our production costs  either of which could materially and adversely affect us 
in addition  we rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain proprietary die cast parts  electronics  software  catalysts and engines for use in our end products 
approximately   and of our purchases of raw materials and services during the years ended december    and  respectively  were supplied by ten entities 
during  one supplier represented of our purchases of raw materials and services 
during  one supplier represented of our purchases of raw materials and services 
during  no suppliers represented more than of our purchases of raw materials and services 
we are highly dependent on certain key personnel 
our success depends on the management and leadership skills of our senior management team 
the unexpected loss of any of these individuals or an inability to attract and retain additional personnel could impede or prevent the implementation of our business strategy 
we cannot assure that we will be able to retain all of our existing senior management personnel or attract additional qualified personnel when needed 
additionally  we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our senior management personnel 
mariano costamagna s employment agreement may limit our board of directors ability to change our senior management 
mariano costamagna  our chief executive officer and a member of our board of directors  has entered into an employment agreement with us that is effective from january  until december  this new employment agreement provides for an annual base salary of  paid in us dollars and  paid in euros  as well as bonuses  benefits and reasonable business expenses 
if  during the term of his employment  we 
table of contents terminate mr 
costamagna s employment other than for cause or disability or if mr 
costamagna resigns for good reason  we must pay mr 
costamagna a severance payment equal to million divided into five equal installments the first of which is due on the th day following termination with subsequent installments due on each anniversary of termination  provided that mr 
costamagna abides by certain covenants limiting his ability to compete with us  solicit our employees or interfere with our business during those four years following his termination 
the required severance payment may limit our board of directors ability to decide whether to retain or to replace mr 
costamagna or to reallocate management responsibilities among our senior executives  a fact that could  in certain circumstances  materially and adversely affect us 
unionized labor disputes at original equipment manufacturer facilities can negatively affect our product sales 
as we become more dependent on vehicle conversion programs with oems  we will become increasingly dependent on oem production and the associated labor forces at oem sites 
for the year ended december   direct oem product sales accounted for approximately of our revenue 
for and  direct oem product sales accounted for approximately and of our revenue  respectively 
labor unions represent most of the labor forces at oem facilities 
in the past  labor disputes have occurred at oem facilities  which have adversely impacted our direct oem product sales 
such labor disputes are likely to occur in the future and  if they do occur  they could materially and adversely affect us 
our business is subject to seasonal influences 
operating results for any quarter are not indicative of the results that may be achieved for any subsequent quarter or for a full year 
many of the factors that impact our operating results are beyond our control and difficult to predict 
they include seasonal work patterns due to vacations and holidays  particularly in our european manufacturing facilities  and fluctuations in demand for the end user products in which our products are placed 
class action litigation due to stock price volatility or other factors could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert our management s time and attention 
from january  through december   our stock price has fluctuated from a low of to a high of 
for  our stock price fluctuated from a low of to a high of 
during  our stock price fluctuated from a low of to a high of 
in the past  securities class action litigation often has been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
companies in the technology industries are particularly vulnerable to this kind of litigation due to the high volatility of their stock prices 
accordingly  we may in the future be the target of securities litigation 
any securities litigation could result in substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion includes forward looking statements about our business  financial condition  and results of operations  including discussions about management s expectations for our business 
these statements represent projections  beliefs and expectations based on current circumstances and conditions and in light of recent events and trends  and you should not construe these statements either as assurances of performances or as promises of a given course of action 
instead  various known and unknown factors are likely to cause our actual performance and management s actions to vary  and the results of these variances may be both material and adverse 
a list of the known material factors that may cause our results to vary  or may cause management to deviate from its current plans and expectations  is included in item a risk factors 
the following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included herein 
overview we design  manufacture and supply alternative fuel components and systems for use in the transportation and industrial markets on a global basis 
our components and systems control the pressure and flow of gaseous alternative fuels  such as propane and natural gas used in internal combustion engines 
our products improve efficiency  enhance power output and reduce emissions by electronically sensing and regulating the proper proportion of fuel and air required by the internal combustion engine 
we also provide engineering and systems integration services to address our individual customer requirements for product performance  durability and physical configuration 
for years  we have developed alternative fuel products 
we supply our products and systems to the market place through a global distribution network of over distributors and dealers in more than countries and more than original equipment manufacturers  or oems 
we offer an array of components  systems and fully integrated solutions for our customers  including fuel delivery pressure regulators  fuel injectors  flow control valves and other components designed to control the pressure  flow and or metering of gaseous fuels  electronic controls solid state components and proprietary software that monitor and optimize fuel pressure and flow to meet manufacturers engine requirements  gaseous fueled internal combustion engines engines manufactured by oems that are integrated with our fuel delivery and electronic controls  systems integration systems integration support to integrate the gaseous fuel storage  fuel delivery and or electronic control components and sub systems to meet oem and aftermarket requirements  auxiliary power systems fully integrated auxiliary power systems for truck and diesel locomotives  and natural gas compressors natural gas compressors and refueling systems for light and heavy duty refueling applications 
manufacturers of industrial mobile equipment and stationary engines are among the most active customers for our industrial products 
users of small and large industrial engines capitalize on the lower cost and pollutant benefits of using alternative fuels 
for example  forklift and other industrial equipment users often use our products to operate equipment indoors resulting in lower toxic emissions 
the wide availability of gaseous fuels in world markets combined with their lower emissions and cost compared to gasoline and diesel fuels is driving rapid growth in the global alternative fuel industry 
automobile manufacturers  taxi companies  transit and shuttle bus companies  and delivery fleets are among the most active customers for our transportation products where our largest markets are currently outside the united states 
we recently completed the acquisitions of productive concepts international  llc pci and evotek llc evotek to expand our activities in the automotive markets within the united states 
evotek and pci together 
table of contents equip our us automotive business with the capabilities necessary to be a leader in this market 
evotek is a strategic transaction that we believe immediately positions fuel systems to compete in the dedicated natural gas vehicle ngv oem market emerging in the united states 
pci adds key technology and industry relationships to further our north american oem and fleet market strategy  and also expands our vehicle modification and systems integration capabilities for a variety of alternative fuel applications  including hybrid  cng  propane and dual fuel diesel 
we continue to believe fleet vehicles offer attractive opportunities for our gaseous fuel solutions in the us we now have a full suite of automotive capabilities in this market  including a carb certified  dedicated systems product line and in house oem systems engineering platform  enhancing our ability to leverage our existing relationships with fleet customers and other manufacturers as they roll out cng and lpg versions of key fleet vehicles 
for the year ended december  revenue decreased approximately  operating profit decreased approximately and diluted eps decreased by 
these results were driven primarily by the expiration of the italian government incentives which drove strong results in our brc operations related to our post production oem doem sales for the prior year 
beginning in the second quarter and continuing into the third and fourth quarters our volumes for doem conversions decreased approximately  and respectively compared to the comparable prior year quarter 
the expiration of the italian government incentives were partially offset by increased activity in our impco operations as well as our aftermarket business 
we expect lower doem volumes to continue into net cash provided by operations was million for the year ended december  in addition  we completed an underwritten offering for the sale of  shares of our common stock 
including the net proceeds from the sale of million  our net cash position of million provides us with adequate capital for working capital and general corporate purposes  which may include expansion of our business  additional repayment of debt and financing of future acquisitions of companies or assets 
recent developments acquisition of productive concepts international llc on september   we acquired productive concepts international llc s alternative fuel vehicle business pci for an estimated transaction value of approximately million including  in assumed debt 
based in union city  indiana  pci is a specialized vehicle modification and value added systems integrator for a variety of alternative fuel applications including hybrid  cng  propane and dual fuel diesel 
we paid million at closing  with an additional cash payment of million payable due upon the achievement of a system installation volume milestone prior to december  further performance payments of up to million in fuel systems solutions stock may be made in the future based on the achievement of and revenue targets 
the first performance payment of million is expected to be paid no later than days after the end of calendar year if revenue is greater than million for the second performance payment of million is expected to be paid no later than days after the end of calendar year if revenue is greater than million for the range of the undiscounted amounts that we could be required to pay for these earnout payments is between and million 
in accordance with the fasb issued authoritative guidance  we determined the fair value of the liability for the contingent consideration based on a probability weighted discounted cash flow analysis 
this fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a level measurement within the fair value hierarchy 
the resultant probability weighted cash flows were then discounted using a rate that reflects the uncertainty surrounding the expected outcomes  which we believe is appropriate and representative of a market participant assumption 
once the purchase accounting for pci has been finalized  future changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration will be determined each period and charged to expense in the consolidated statements of operations under operating expenses 
as of the closing date of the acquisition  the pci contingent consideration was assigned a preliminary fair value of approximately million  of which million is in escrow and classified in other current assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheet at december  
table of contents the results of operations of pci have been included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition within the impco operating segment 
the purchase price has been allocated based on management s preliminary estimates as follows in thousands total tangible assets intangible assets subject to amortization goodwill total assets acquired less total liabilities including contingent consideration total net assets recorded of the million of acquired intangible assets  the entire amount relates to customer relationships with a useful life of approximately years 
the continued development of the us alternative fuel vehicle market as well as potential legislative changes impacting this market were among the factors that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill of million 
the acquired goodwill is deductible for tax purposes 
the above purchase price has been allocated based on an estimate of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
management is in the process of finalizing its valuations of certain intangible assets as well as the contingent consideration  thus the value of the consideration paid and allocation of the purchase price is subject to refinement 
management has determined that the acquisition of pci was a non material business combination 
as such  pro forma disclosures are not required and are not presented within this filing 
acquisition of evotek llc on september   we acquired evotek llc evotek  a premier alternative fuel automotive systems developer in north america that offers dedicated cng and lpg conversion systems across multiple us fleet vehicle platforms 
the aggregate purchase price for of the equity of evotek was approximately million in cash 
in addition  we issued  shares of common stock in a transaction exempt from registration under section of the securities act of  as amended  since the issuance did not involve a public offering 
the  shares of common stock are in escrow and will be released in three equal annual installments upon achievement of certain product development milestones 
the evotek contingent consideration shares held in escrow with a value of million will be recognized as share based compensation expense with a debit to research and development and a credit to additional paid in capital  over the earn out period provided generally that such former evotek employee is an employee of the company at the time the acquisition related contingent consideration is earned 
the results of operations of evotek have been included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition within the impco operating segment 
the purchase price has been allocated based upon management s preliminary estimate as follows million to existing technology with an estimated useful life of years and approximately million to net tangible asset 
as with the pci acquisition  the continued development of the us alternative fuel market as well as potential legislative changes impacting this market were among the factors that contributed to a purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill of million 
the acquired goodwill is deductible for tax purposes 
the above purchase price has been allocated based on an estimate of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
management is in the process of finalizing its valuations of certain intangible assets as well as the contingent consideration  thus the value of the consideration paid and allocation of the purchase price is subject to refinement 

table of contents management has determined that the acquisition of evotek was a non material business combination 
as such  pro forma disclosures are not required and are not presented within this filing 
capital transactions on december   we closed an underwritten public offering of  shares of common stock including  shares issued pursuant to an underwriter s overallotment option at a price of per share 
net proceeds from the offering were million  after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses 
under a committed credit facility with intesa sanpaolo spa  we were required to use the net proceeds from the offering to repay the outstanding balance under such facility 
following such mandatory repayment  we expect to use the remaining net proceeds from the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes  which may include expansion of our business  additional repayment of debt and financing of future acquisitions of companies or assets 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  goodwill  taxes  inventories  warranty obligations  long term service contracts  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the accounting policies related to the following accounts or activities are those that are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require the more significant judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss  generally when products are shipped provided there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and management believes collectability is reasonably assured 
we consider arrangements with extended payment terms not to be fixed or determinable unless they are secured under an irrevocable letter of credit arrangement guaranteed by a reputable financial institution  and accordingly  we defer such revenue until amounts become due and payable 
we classify shipping and handling charges billed to customers as revenue 
shipping and handling costs paid to others are classified as a component of cost of sales when incurred 
we provide for returns and allowances as circumstances and facts require 
sales to our unconsolidated subsidiaries are made on terms similar to those prevailing with unrelated customers as noted above 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified through management s review of outstanding accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized based  in part  on historical experience 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
we believe that our warranty experience is within the industry norms 
our standard warranty period is to months from the date of delivery to the customer depending on the product 
the warranty obligation on our certified engine products can vary from three to five years depending on the specific part and the actual hours of usage 
inventory reserves we write down our inventory for estimated slow moving and obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill and intangible assets we recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values 
goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
in those acquisitions that include contingent consideration ie earnout payments to be paid upon the satisfaction of certain milestones as part of the total consideration paid  we determine the fair value of this liability at the acquisition date using a probability weighted income approach 
while we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed including any contingent consideration at the acquisition date  our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement 
as a result  during the measurement period  which may be up to one year from the acquisition date  we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  with the corresponding offset to goodwill 
upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  whichever comes first  any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations 
accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets  support obligations assumed  estimated restructuring liabilities and pre acquisition contingencies 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and they are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include  but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired developed technologies and patents and other customer contracts and  the life of the acquired developed technologies and patents  the acquired company s brand and competitive position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and g risk associated with uncertainty  achievement and payment of any milestones  the life of the acquired developed technologies and patents  
table of contents the acquired company s brand and competitive position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
in addition  uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date and we reevaluate these items quarterly  with any adjustments to our preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period and we continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated values 
subsequent to the measurement period  our final determination of the uncertain tax positions estimated value  or tax related valuation allowances  changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations and could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
goodwill and intangible assets impairment assessments we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable 
the fasb issued authoritative guidance requiring that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit ie an operating segment  or one level below an operating segment to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions  and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis  which was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal  did not result in an impairment charge  nor did we record any goodwill impairment in fiscal or in relation with our annual impairment analysis 
however  during the second quarter of  changes in the australian business climate indicated that goodwill for impco australia might be impaired 
as a result  we performed and analysis and recorded an impairment charge of million to fully impair impco australia s goodwill balance 
we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finite lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist 
each period we evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 
recoverability of finite lived intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other long lived assets are complex and subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our 
table of contents internal forecasts 
although we believe the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
we did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal  or deferred taxes based upon the substantial net operating loss carryforwards and recent history of losses incurred in certain jurisdictions  we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions as of december  will be realized within the foreseeable future 
the balance of the total united states valuation allowance was million as of december  in addition  we have a foreign valuation allowance of million as of december  we expect to provide a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits generated in the united states and in certain foreign jurisdictions until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to utilize the deferred tax assets 
as of december   undistributed earnings  except with respect to a portion of undistributed earnings from brc  are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and  accordingly  no provision for united states federal and state income taxes is provided thereon 
residual us taxes have been accrued applied as a reduction of net operating loss carryforwards on approximately million of earnings of brc that is not considered indefinitely reinvested 
such amounts could be drawn as a dividend or from brc in the future without us income tax consequences 
upon distributions of earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise  we would be subject to both us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries 
we have accrued such residual income taxes for all undistributed foreign earnings not considered indefinitely reinvested 
it is not practical to determine the income tax impact in the event we repatriate undistributed foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested 
as of december   approximately million in foreign withholding taxes was accrued related to undistributed earnings not considered to be indefinitely reinvested 
we believe that we have considered relevant circumstances that we may be currently subject to  and the financial statements accurately reflect our best estimate of the results of our operations  financial condition and cash flows for the years presented 
we have discussed the decision process and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors

these increases were partially offset by lower outside consultant costs 
corporate expenses 
corporate expenses consist of general and administrative expenses at the corporate level to support our business segments in areas such as executive management  finance  human resources  management information systems  legal and accounting services and investor relations 
corporate expenses in decreased compared to primarily because of a reduction in employees in our corporate office  as well as lower outside service costs 

table of contents operating income loss year ended december  change percent change impco operations brc operations corporate expenses represents corporate expense not allocated to either of the business segments 
operating income for the year ended december  decreased for the reasons stated above 
operating loss for the quarter ended december  was million compared to operating income of million for the prior year quarter

other income expense  net 
other income expense includes foreign exchange gains and losses between various other assets and liabilities to be settled in other currencies 
for the years ended december  and we recognized approximately million and million  respectively in gains on foreign exchange 
we routinely conduct transactions in currencies other than our reporting currency  the us dollar 
we cannot estimate or forecast the direction or the magnitude of any foreign exchange movements with any currency that we transact in  therefore  we do not measure or predict the future impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements 
included in other income for the year end december   is a gain of approximately million associated with the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in wmtm 
this acquisition qualified as a step acquisition which occurs when a shareholder obtains control over an entity by acquiring an additional interest in that entity 
under the appropriate fasb issued authoritative guidance  the previously held equity interest was remeasured to fair value at the date of the acquisition 
interest expense 
for the year ended december   interest expense decreased approximately million to million  from million in this decrease was primarily due to a lower weighted average outstanding debt in compared to provision for income taxes 
income tax expense for the year ended december  and was approximately million and million  representing an effective tax rate of and  respectively  and primarily consisted of the provision for our foreign operations 
a full valuation allowance is maintained against the income tax benefits generated in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions due to cumulative losses incurred in those jurisdictions  as we cannot conclude that such tax benefits meet the more likely than not threshold for realization 
accordingly  for the year ended december   we have not recorded income tax benefits for losses incurred or significant income tax expense for income generated for such jurisdictions as such amounts will be offset by the valuation allowance 
we operate in an international environment with significant operations in various locations outside of the united states  which have statutory tax rates that are different from the united states tax rate 
accordingly  the consolidated income tax rate is a composite rate reflecting the earnings in the various locations and the applicable rates 
the change in the effective tax rate is primarily a result of the fluctuation of earnings in the various jurisdictions

liquidity and capital resources overview our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities and debt financing 
additionally from time to time we raise funds from the equity capital markets to fund our capital expenditures  research and development  strategic acquisitions as well as to invest in and operate our existing operations and prospective new lines of business 
we believe the amounts available to us under our various credit agreements together with cash provided by operating activities will continue to allow us to meet our needs for working capital and other cash needs for worldwide operations for at least the next months 
for periods beyond months  although we do not have any plans to do so  we may seek additional financing to fund future operations through future offerings of equity or debt securities or through agreements with corporate partners with respect to the development of the company s technologies and products 
however  we can offer no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms  if at all 
nevertheless  our ability to satisfy our working capital requirements will substantially depend upon our future operating performance which may be affected by prevailing economic conditions  and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control

recent accounting pronouncements accounting standards adopted in in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities and changes the consolidation guidance applicable to a variable interest entity vie 
it also amends the guidance governing the determination of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie  and is  therefore  required to consolidate an entity  by requiring a qualitative analysis rather than a quantitative analysis 
the qualitative analysis will include  among other things  consideration of who has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and who has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
this standard also requires continuous reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie 
former guidance required reconsideration of whether an enterprise was the primary beneficiary of a vie only when specific events had occurred 
the new guidance also requires enhanced disclosures about an enterprise s involvement with a vie 
the adoption of this guidance on january  did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency management 
we operate on a global basis and are exposed to currency fluctuations related to the manufacture  assemble and sale of our products in currencies other than the us dollar 
the major foreign currencies involve the markets in the european union  argentina  australia and canada 
movements in currency exchange rates may affect the translated value of our earnings and cash flow associated with out foreign operations as well as the translation of the net asset or liability positions that are denominated in foreign currencies 
in countries outside of the united states  we generally generate revenues and incur operating expenses denominated in local currencies 
these revenue and expenses are translated using the average rates during the period in which they are recognized and are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates 
we monitor this risk and attempt to minimize the exposure to our net results through the management of cash disbursements in local currencies 
we mitigate our foreign currency economic risk by minimizing our u 
s dollar investment in foreign operations using foreign currency term loans to finance our foreign subsidiaries 
we prepared sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of hypothetical changes foreign currency exchange rates have on our results of operations 
the foreign currency rate analysis assumed a uniform movement in currencies by relative to the us dollar on our results 
based upon the results of these analyses  a change in currency rates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in our earnings for the year ended december  by approximately million 
we seek to hedge our foreign currency economic risk by minimizing our us dollar investment in foreign operations using foreign currency term loans to finance our foreign subsidiaries
