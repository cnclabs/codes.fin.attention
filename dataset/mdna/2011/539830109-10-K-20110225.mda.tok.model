item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management overview lockheed martin is a global security company that principally is engaged in the research  design  development  manufacture  integration  and sustainment of advanced technology systems and products 
we provide a broad range of management  engineering  technical  scientific  logistic  and information services 
we serve both domestic and international customers with products and services that have defense  civil  and commercial applications  with our principal customers being agencies of the us government 
in  of our billion in net sales were made to the us government 
approximately of our net sales were made to the department of defense dod  with approximately attributable to non dod agencies 
sales to foreign governments including foreign military sales funded  in whole or in part  by the us government amounted to of net sales in the remainder of our net sales was attributable to commercial and other customers 
our main areas of focus are in defense  space  intelligence  homeland security  and government information technology 
we operate in four principal business segments aeronautics  electronic systems  information systems global solutions is gs  and space systems 
we organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered 
we are operating in an environment that is characterized by both increasing complexity in the global security environment  as well as continuing economic pressures in the united states and globally 
a significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on core program execution  improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services  and placing more security capability into the hands of our customers at affordable prices 
we also are focused on cost reduction  through programs like our recent voluntary executive separation program vesp and facility reduction initiatives  to further enhance the affordability of our products and services 
while we expect our sales to increase in the low single digits for  growth rates are slowing for our company and across the industry as compared to prior years as our customers are preparing to meet new security challenges without the benefit of increased resources in any given fiscal year 
we expect our segment operating profit for to be consistent with as margins face pressure in this environment 
despite the challenges we face  we expect to generate strong operating cash flows  which allows us to continue to invest in technologies to fulfill new mission requirements for our customers  invest in our people so that we have the professional and leadership skills necessary to be successful in this environment  and return at least of free cash flow to investors in the form of share repurchases and dividends 
industry considerations us government business budget priorities the us government continues to focus on developing and implementing spending  tax  and other initiatives to stimulate the economy  create jobs  and reduce the deficit 
the administration is attempting to balance decisions regarding defense  homeland security  and other federal spending priorities with the cost of these initiatives and increased deficit spending  particularly in the longer term 
although some specific priorities and initiatives may change from year to year  the investments and acquisitions we have made have been focused on aligning our businesses to address what we believe are the most critical national priorities and mission areas 
the possibility remains  however  that one or more of our programs could be reduced  extended  or terminated as a result of the administration s continuing assessment of priorities 
the administration s spending priorities were released on february  with the submission of the president s budget request for fiscal year every year  congress must approve or revise the proposals contained in the president s annual budget request through enactment of appropriations bills and other policy legislation  which then require final presidential approval 
the outcome of the federal budget process has a direct effect on our business 
we define free cash flow as cash from operations as determined under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  less the amount identified as expenditures for property  plant and equipment as presented on our statements of cash flows 

table of contents department of defense business the dod base budget has seen consistent growth over the past ten years  enabling it to grow from billion at the start of the last decade to billion in the president s baseline budget request for fiscal year the fiscal year request represents nominal growth of over the fiscal year baseline budget of billion 
this baseline budget assumes that the continuing resolution currently in place see discussion below is extended through the end of fiscal year preliminary insights into national security funding priorities for fiscal year and beyond were revealed on january  by secretary of defense robert gates 
specifically  his defense spending proposal reflected a slight increase in nominal growth over the next few years 
to date  congress has funded us military operations in afghanistan and iraq  and other unforeseeable contingency or peacekeeping operations  through a separate overseas contingency operations oco funding outside of the base dod budget 
the oco funding for fiscal year totaled billion  and the administration requested billion in fiscal year our sales historically have not been significantly dependent on overseas contingency or supplemental funding requests  and therefore we continue to focus our attention on the dod s base budget for support and funding of our programs 
in december  congress passed a continuing resolution funding measure for fiscal year to finance all us government activities through march  under this continuing resolution  partial year funding at amounts consistent with appropriated levels for fiscal year are available  subject to certain restrictions  but new spending initiatives are not authorized 
our key programs continue to be supported and funded despite the continuing resolution financing mechanism 
however  during periods covered by continuing resolutions or until the regular appropriation bills are passed  we may experience delays in procurement of products and services due to lack of funding  and those delays may affect our sales and profit during the period 
the current continuing resolution has not had a material effect on our results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
the arrival of a new congress in january with the house of representatives and senate under control of different political parties creates the potential for some uncertainty as to whether the government will continue to operate under a continuing resolution for the remainder of the fiscal year or will be able to enact appropriations legislation 
we believe our broad mix of programs and capabilities continues to position us favorably to support the current and future needs of the dod 
as the dod increases its emphasis on affordability in the current fiscal environment and continues to respond to the increasingly complex and dynamic global security environment  many of our products remain well positioned to meet the needs of the military services 
for example  while secretary gates proposed changes to our f program which will affect the aircraft s development and transition to production see the f discussion under the caption other business considerations in this section  the aircraft remains a national priority 
additionally  the us navy plans to evolve the aegis air and missile defense system through modernization programs to derive maximum utility over the long service lives of these systems 
the navy also recently decided to procure up to ten additional littoral combat ships from us over the next five years 
the need for more affordable logistics and sustainment  expansive use of information technology and knowledge based solutions  and vastly improved levels of network and cybersecurity  all appear to continue to be national priorities 
to address these priorities  we have been growing our portfolio in these areas  diversifying our business  and expanding into adjacent businesses and programs that include surface naval vessels  rotary wing aviation  and land vehicles 
we have expanded production of the c j super hercules tactical airlifter to meet the needs of the us government and international customers 
despite recent proposed changes  we continue to prepare for increased production of the f lightning ii joint strike fighter for the us navy  air force  and marine corps  and international partners in future years 
this program continues to be a significant element of a broader us effort to build the capacity of alliance partners throughout the world 
in the areas of space based intelligence and information superiority  we are the prime contractor on programs such as the global positioning satellite program  mobile user objective system  the advanced extremely high frequency system  the space based infrared system high  and classified programs 
our products are represented in almost every aspect of land  sea  air  and space based missile defense  including the aegis  the patriot advanced capability pac missile program  and the terminal high altitude area defense thaad transportable defensive missile system 
we continue to perform on contracts to develop and deliver essential munitions  missile  and other systems  such as hellfire  guided multiple launch rocket systems  and eq radar systems 
we also have unmanned systems capabilities  including air  ground  and underwater systems 

table of contents in the area of command  control  communications  computers  intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance cisr programs  our capabilities include the airborne maritime fixed joint tactical radio system  the warfighter information network tactical  the combatant commanders integrated command and control system  and the global communications support system air force 
we have a significant presence in the support and modernization of the dod s information technology systems 
we see opportunities for expansion of our sustainment and logistical support activities to enhance the longevity and cost effectiveness of the systems procured by our customers  and for improving global supply chain management 
non department of defense business our experience in the defense arena  together with our core information technology and services expertise  has enabled us to provide products and services to a number of government agencies  including the departments of homeland security  justice  commerce  health and human services  transportation  and energy  the us postal service  the social security administration  the federal aviation administration  the national aeronautics and space administration nasa  the environmental protection agency epa  the national archives  and the library of congress 
all non defense agencies also are operating under a continuing resolution that requires them to remain at fiscal year funding levels 
in addition  the president s budget proposes a three year freeze in certain civil agency budgets  including agencies to which we provide products and services 
we believe our key programs will continue to be supported in the budgets of the various agencies with which we do business 
we have continued to expand our capabilities in critical intelligence  knowledge management  and e government solutions for our customers  including the social security administration and the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms 
we also provide program management  business strategy and consulting  complex systems development and maintenance  complete life cycle software support  information assurance  and enterprise solutions 
in the civil arena  as with our defense business  we have not seen a significant effect on our business from the administration s stated policy of in sourcing 
we believe that there will be continued demand by federal and civil government agencies for upgrading and investing in new information technology systems and solutions  but at a somewhat slower pace in the near term 
consistent with our dod business  more affordable logistics and sustainment  a more expansive use of information technology and knowledge based solutions  and improved levels of network and cybersecurity all appear to be priorities in our non dod business as well 
homeland security  critical infrastructure protection  and improved service levels for civil government agencies also appear to be high customer priorities 
the continuing strong emphasis on homeland security may increase demand for our capabilities in areas such as air traffic management  ports  waterways and cargo security  biohazard detection systems for postal equipment  employee identification and credential verification systems  information systems security  and other global security systems solutions 
other business considerations international business we remain committed to growth in our sales to international customers 
we conduct business with foreign governments primarily through aeronautics and electronic systems 
our international sales are composed of foreign military sales through the us government and direct commercial contracts 
in aeronautics  the us government and eight foreign government partners are working together on the design  testing  production  and sustainment of the f lightning ii  while other countries such as israel have recently selected the f as their next generation combat aircraft 
we expect international deliveries of the f to begin in the f fighting falcon has been selected by countries  with follow on buys from countries 
we continue to expand the c j super hercules air mobility aircraft s international footprint with customers in countries including recent orders from israel  kuwait  korea  and tunisia 
in global sustainment  we are leveraging our value as the original equipment manufacturer oem for our major platforms and have set up new production capabilities to provide service life extension  including new wings and support for norway s p fleet 
we have also received awards from the us and canadian governments to upgrade their p aircraft 
with regard to the aegis weapon system  our electronic systems segment performs activities in the development  production  ship integration and test  and lifetime support for ships of international customers such as japan  spain  korea  norway  and australia 
the system also has been selected to be used as a ground based missile defense system in europe  referred to as aegis ashore 
this segment has contracts with the canadian government for the upgrade and support of 
table of contents combat systems on halifax class frigates 
the new littoral combat ship is also generating interest from potential international customers 
electronic systems also produces the pac missile  an advanced defensive missile designed to intercept incoming airborne threats  for international customers including japan  germany  the netherlands  taiwan  and the united arab emirates uae 
international customers have also expressed interest in our thaad defensive missile system 
to the extent our contracts and business arrangements with international partners include operations in foreign countries  other risks are introduced into our business  including changing economic conditions  fluctuations in relative currency values  regulation by foreign countries  and the potential for deterioration of political relations 
status of the f program the system development and demonstration sdd portion of the f program has experienced schedule delays  work scope changes  and cost increases 
in the second quarter of  the dod recertified the f program after completing a legally required review of the program s priority  capability  cost  and management structure in accordance with the nunn mccurdy process established under federal law 
the nunn mccurdy process requires notification to the us congress if dod program cost estimates exceed specified threshold levels  and includes a requirement that a program be terminated if cost estimates increase by above the original program baseline  unless the dod makes prescribed findings about the program 
as part of that process  the dod certified that continuation of the f program is essential to national security  among other required findings 
in connection with the recertification  the dod tasked the f program executive officer to complete a technical baseline review which addressed program requirements  schedule  and cost 
on january   the secretary of defense outlined the recommendations of the technical baseline review 
those recommendations included adding funding to the f development program and extending development through these funds are to be used for additional development scope  for testing and risk retirement activities to better position the program for production  and to correct prior estimates 
the secretary of defense also identified the us air force conventional take off and landing ctol version and the navy carrier version  which represent over percent of the planned domestic production run  as proceeding satisfactorily in development 
testing challenges and delays on the short takeoff and vertical landing stovl variant resulted in a decision to decouple stovl testing from the other models and to move the development of the stovl aircraft to the back of the overall joint strike fighter jsf production sequence 
we believe that these actions will better position the stovl variant to demonstrate improved reliability over the next two years 
given the size and complexity of the f program  we anticipate that there will be additional reviews related to program schedule  cost  requirements  and aircraft quantities as part of the dod  congressional  and international partners oversight and budgeting processes 
current program challenges include completion of the flight testing  supply chain performance  and software development 
the sdd portion of the f program has million of fee remaining 
any portion of the remaining fee that we or our partners receive is dependent upon completion of milestones  most of which have not yet been determined 
although not exclusively related to the f program  on october   the defense contracting management agency dcma withdrew its prior validation and determination of compliance of the earned value management system evms at our fort worth  texas location 
evms is a tool for managing cost and schedule performance on complex programs 
to re establish evms compliance at fort worth  we need to demonstrate corrective actions have been implemented to address prior dcma audit findings on evms affecting the f and other aeronautics programs which are managed at that location 
the dcma may choose to re audit our evms system at any time  but we understand that the dcma will do so once a performance history on the new sdd baseline is established 
the new sdd baseline may not be established until after the initial baseline review is completed in late on october   the israeli government signed a letter of offer and acceptance with the us government for the procurement of f aircraft 
israel is expected to be the first country to receive the f through the us government s foreign military sales process 
portfolio shaping activities we continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers 
we accomplish this internally through our independent research and development activities  and through acquisition  divestiture  and internal realignment activities 

table of contents we selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses and investments that complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies 
we have made a number of niche acquisitions of businesses and investments in affiliates during the past several years 
we also may explore the divestiture of businesses 
if we were to decide to sell a business  the resulting gains  if any  would be recorded when the transactions are completed or as otherwise required under gaap and losses  if any  would be recorded when the carrying value of the related business is determined to be impaired 
we also undertake internal realignment activities to adjust our portfolio of businesses to address changes in customer demand for our products and services 
divestitures in june  we announced plans to divest pacific architects and engineers  inc pae and most of our enterprise integration group eig  two businesses within our is gs reporting segment see note 
pae s and eig s operating results are included in discontinued operations on our statements of earnings for all periods presented  and pae s assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale on our balance sheet 
in november  we closed on the sale of eig 
our decision to divest eig was based on our analysis of the us government s increased concerns about perceived organizational conflicts of interest within the defense contracting community 
eig provides systems engineering  architecture  and integration services and support to a broad range of government customers 
on february   we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to sell pae 
we expect the transaction will close in the second quarter of  subject to satisfaction of closing conditions 
the plan to divest pae is a result of changes in customer priorities 
when we acquired the business  we envisioned it as an entry point to a new customer set that would need additional services  primarily in the areas of information technology and systems integration 
those customers  however  are seeking a different mix of services  such as the construction of facilities and provision of physical security  which does not fit with our long term strategy 
realignment activities in  electronic systems realigned its lines of business which now operate as mission systems sensors ms  missiles fire control m fc  and global training logistics gt l 
the realignment included the movement of two is gs businesses  readiness stability operations rso and savi technology  inc  to electronic systems see note 
the realignment resulted in the combination of our ground vehicles programs  which were previously reported in the former platforms training p t line of business and included the joint light tactical vehicle program  with m fc 
we also realigned rso and savi technology  inc with electronic systems simulation  training and support business previously included in the former p t line of business to form gt l 
we combined the remaining elements of the former p t line of business with the former maritime systems sensors line of business to form ms these realignment activities had no effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
all comparative financial information and related discussions of electronic systems and is gs in this form k reflects these realignment activities 
results of operations since our operating cycle is long term and involves many types of design  development  and production dd p contracts with varying production delivery schedules  the results of operations of a particular year  or year to year comparisons of recorded sales and profits  may not be indicative of future operating results 
the following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context

table of contents the following discussion of operating results provides an overview of our operations by focusing on key elements in our statements of earnings 
the discussion of business segments section that follows describes the contributions of each of our business segments to our consolidated net sales and operating profit for   and we follow an integrated approach for managing the performance of our business  and focus the discussion of our results of operations around major products and lines of business versus distinguishing between products and services 
product sales are predominantly generated in the aeronautics  electronic systems  and space systems segments  while most of our services sales are generated in our is gs segment 
continuing operations for  net sales were billion  a increase over net sales for were billion  a increase over net sales of billion 
net sales increased during in all segments except space systems as compared to net sales increased during in all segments as compared to see the discussion of business segments 
our operating profit for was billion  a decrease of compared to operating profit of billion in the decline in operating profit of million primarily was attributable to the effects of charges  net of state income tax benefits  of million related to the vesp and million related to facilities consolidation within the ms line of business in electronic systems see note 
also contributing to the decline was an increase of million in other unallocated corporate costs attributable to various corporate activities 
our operating profit for was billion  a decrease of compared to operating profit of billion in  operating profit was negatively affected by the fas cas pension adjustment see note for a description of this adjustment  which was an expense of million in as compared to income of million in due to the negative actual return on plan assets in and a lower discount rate at december  in addition  operating profit was lower due to recognition of a deferred gain of million in from the sale of our ownership interest in lockheed khrunichev energia international  inc lkei and international launch services  inc 
ils in see note  earnings of million recorded in associated with reserves related to various land sales that were no longer required see note  and a million loss on the sale of a foreign subsidiary 
these declines more than offset increased operating profit at the aeronautics  electronic systems and space systems business segments 
interest expense for was million  or million higher than the increase mainly was driven by interest expense on the billion of long term notes issued in the fourth quarter of interest expense for was million  or million lower than the decrease mainly was driven by the august redemption of our billion of floating rate convertible debentures  partially offset by increases resulting from the fourth quarter issuance of billion of long term notes and the first quarter issuance of million of long term notes 
other non operating income expense  net was income of million and million in and  and expense of million in the changes between periods primarily reflect gains losses on marketable securities held to fund certain non qualified employee benefit obligations 
our effective income tax rates from continuing operations were for  for  and for these rates were lower than the statutory rate of for all periods due to tax benefits for us manufacturing activities  the deduction of dividends related to certain of our defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature  and the research and development r d tax credit 
the effective tax rate was affected by the enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of  which eliminated the tax deduction for company paid retiree prescription drug expenses to the extent they are reimbursed under medicare part d  beginning in as a result  the corporation recorded additional income tax expense of million in the rate for also included additional tax benefits related to us manufacturing activities primarily due to an increase in qualified production activity income and an increase in the us manufacturing activity deduction rate from to 
the effective tax rate reflected a reduction of income tax expense of million primarily arising from the resolution of irs examinations of the years through and we reported net earnings from continuing operations of billion per share in  billion per share in  and billion per share in both net earnings from continuing operations and earnings per share were affected by the factors discussed above 
in addition  earnings per share has benefitted from the significant number of shares repurchased under our share repurchase programs see note 
the effect of those repurchases has been partially offset by common stock issued under our stock based compensation and defined contribution plans

additionally  as a result of our decision to sell pae in  we recorded a million deferred tax asset which reflects the federal and state tax benefits that we expect to realize on the sale  because our tax basis is higher than our book basis 
earnings from discontinued operations also included an impairment charge of million related to the planned sale of pae  as the carrying value of the business exceeded the expected net proceeds from the sale transaction 
in total  these items associated with pae increased earnings from discontinued operations by million

discussion of business segments we operate in four principal business segments aeronautics  electronic systems  is gs  and space systems 
we organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered 
the following table presents net sales and operating profit of our four business segments 
net sales exclude intersegment revenue  as these activities are eliminated in consolidation 
intercompany transactions are generally negotiated and accounted for under terms and conditions similar to other government and commercial contracts 
operating profit of the business segments includes the equity earnings or losses from investees in which certain of our business segments hold equity interests  because the activities of the investees are closely aligned with the operations of those segments 
operating profit of the business segments excludes the fas cas pension adjustment discussed under the caption postretirement benefit plans in the section on critical accounting policies  expense for certain stock based compensation programs including costs for stock options and restricted stock units  the effects of items not considered part of management s evaluation of segment operating performance  such as the charges related to the vesp in and the ms consolidation plan announced in see note  gains or losses from divestitures  the effects of legal settlements  corporate costs not allocated to the business segments  and other miscellaneous corporate activities 
the items other than the charges related to the vesp and the ms consolidation plan are included in other unallocated corporate income expense  net in the following table which reconciles operating profit from the business segments to operating profit in our statements of earnings 
the charges related to the vesp and ms consolidation plan are presented together as a separate reconciling item 
in millions net sales aeronautics electronic systems information systems global solutions space systems total operating profit aeronautics electronic systems information systems global solutions space systems total business segments vesp and other charges other unallocated corporate income expense  net total the following segment discussions also include information relating to negotiated backlog for each segment 
total negotiated backlog was approximately billion  billion  and billion at december    and these amounts included both funded backlog unfilled firm orders for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer congress in the case of us government agencies and unfunded backlog firm orders for 
table of contents which funding has not yet been appropriated 
negotiated backlog does not include unexercised options or task orders to be issued under indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity idiq contracts 
funded backlog was approximately billion at december  we use the percentage of completion method of accounting for our long term design  development and production contracts  which we refer to as products in our statements of earnings 
under this method of accounting  we record sales on contracts based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion 
changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales resulting from varying production activity levels  deliveries  or service levels on individual contracts 
volume changes typically include a corresponding change in operating profit based on the estimate of profit at completion for a particular contract 
for example  if the cost volume on a cost reimbursement type contract increased or decreased compared with a prior period  sales and operating profit for that contract will also be increased or decreased 
changes in performance refer to increases or decreases in the estimated profit booking rates on our contracts for products 
performance changes usually relate to revisions in the total estimated costs at completion that reflect improved or deteriorated operating or award fee performance on a particular contract 
such changes in estimated profit booking rates are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception to date effect of such changes 
for example  if we increase the estimated profit booking rate on a cost reimbursable contract  the increase in sales and operating profit for that contract will reflect a higher return on sales in the current period due to the recognition of the higher booking rate on both current period costs as well as previously incurred costs 
accordingly  such changes in the estimated profit booking rates may affect the comparison of segment operating results 
for our services contracts  changes in volume are reflective of increases or decreases in the level of services being provided under each contract 
performance refers to changes in the levels of operating profit 
sales are recognized as the services are performed  typically on a straight line basis 
award and incentive fees related to the performance on these contracts are recognized when communicated to us by the customer 
costs associated with these contracts are expensed as incurred 
accordingly  the timing for recognizing the effect of costs and award and incentive fees on our services contracts may affect the comparison of segment operating results 
the aeronautics segment generally includes fewer programs that have much larger sales and operating results than programs included in the other segments 
due to the large number of comparatively smaller programs in the remaining segments  the discussion of the results of operations of those business segments focuses on lines of business within the segment rather than on specific programs 
the following tables of financial information and related discussion of the results of operations of our business segments are consistent with the presentation of segment information in note to the financial statements 
we have a number of programs that are classified by the us government and cannot be specifically described 
the operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results  and are subjected to the same oversight and internal controls as our other programs 
aeronautics our aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research  design  development  manufacture  integration  sustainment  support  and upgrade of advanced military aircraft  including combat and air mobility aircraft  unmanned air vehicles  and related technologies 
key combat aircraft programs include the f lightning ii  f fighting falcon  and f raptor fighter aircraft 
key air mobility programs include the c j super hercules and the c m super galaxy 
aeronautics provides logistics support  sustainment  and upgrade modification services for its aircraft 
aeronautics operating results included the following in millions net sales operating profit operating margin backlog at year end net sales for aeronautics increased by in compared to sales increased in all three lines of business during the year 
the million increase in air mobility primarily was attributable to higher volume on c programs  including deliveries and support activities  as well as higher volume on the c reliability enhancement and re engining 
table of contents program rerp 
there were c j deliveries in compared to in the million increase in combat aircraft principally was due to higher volume on f production contracts  which partially was offset by lower volume on the f sdd contract and a decline in volume on f  f and other combat aircraft programs 
there were f deliveries in compared to in the million increase in other aeronautics programs mainly was due to higher volume on p and advanced development programs  which partially were offset by a decline in volume on sustainment activities 
net sales for aeronautics increased by in compared to during the year  sales increased in all three lines of business 
the increase of million in air mobility s sales primarily was attributable to higher volume on the c programs  including deliveries and support activities 
there were c j deliveries in and in combat aircraft sales increased million principally due to higher volume on the f program and increases in f deliveries  which partially were offset by lower volume on f and other combat aircraft programs 
there were f deliveries in compared to in the million increase in other aeronautics programs mainly was due to higher volume on p programs and advanced development programs  which partially were offset by declines in sustainment activities 
operating profit for the segment decreased by in compared to a decline in operating profit in combat aircraft partially was offset by increases in other aeronautics programs and air mobility 
the million decrease in combat aircraft s operating profit primarily was due to lower volume and a decrease in the level of favorable performance adjustments on the f program  the f sdd contract and f and other combat aircraft programs in these decreases more than offset increased operating profit resulting from higher volume and improved performance on f production contracts in the million increase in other aeronautics programs mainly was attributable to higher volume and improved performance on p and advanced development programs as well as an increase in the level of favorable performance adjustments on sustainment activities in the million increase in air mobility operating profit primarily was due to higher volume and improved performance in on c j support activities  which more than offset a decrease in operating profit due to a lower level of favorable performance adjustments on c j deliveries in the remaining change in operating profit is attributable to an increase in other income  net between the comparable periods 
aeronautics operating margins have decreased when compared to the operating margin decrease reflects the life cycles of our significant programs 
specifically  aeronautics is performing more development and initial production work on the f program and is performing less work on more mature programs such as the f and f development and initial production contracts yield lower profits than mature full rate programs 
accordingly  while net sales increased in relative to  operating profit decreased and consequently operating margins have declined 
operating profit for the segment increased in compared to the growth in operating profit primarily was due to increases in air mobility and other aeronautics programs 
the million increase in air mobility s operating profit primarily was due to the higher volume on c j deliveries and c support programs 
in other aeronautics programs  operating profit increased million  which mainly was attributable to improved performance in sustainment activities and higher volume on p programs 
additionally  the increase in operating profit included the favorable restructuring of a p modification contract in combat aircraft s operating profit decreased million during the year primarily due to a reduction in the level of favorable performance adjustments on f programs in compared to and lower volume on other combat aircraft programs 
these decreases more than offset increased operating profit resulting from higher volume and improved performance on the f program and an increase in the level of favorable performance adjustments on the f program in compared to the remaining change in operating profit is attributable to a decrease in other income  net  between the comparable periods 
backlog increased in compared to mainly due to orders exceeding sales on the c j  f and c programs  which partially were offset by higher sales volume compared to new orders on the f program in backlog decreased in compared to mainly due to sales exceeding orders on the f and f programs  which partially were offset by orders exceeding sales on the c j and c programs 
we expect aeronautics will have sales growth in the upper single digit percentage range for as compared to this increase primarily is driven by growth on f low rate initial production lrip contracts  c j and c rerp programs that will more than offset a decline on the f program 
operating profit is projected to increase at a mid single digit percentage rate above levels  resulting in a decline in operating margins between the years 
similar to the relationship of operating margins from to discussed above  the expected operating margin decrease from to reflects the trend of aeronautics performing more development and initial production work on the f program and is performing less work on more mature programs such as the f and f  even though sales are expected to increase in relative to 
table of contents electronic systems our electronic systems business segment manages complex programs and designs  develops  produces  and integrates hardware and software solutions to ensure the mission readiness of armed forces and government agencies worldwide 
the segment s three lines of business are mission systems sensors ms  missiles fire control m fc  and global training logistics gt l 
with such a broad portfolio of programs to provide products and services  many of its activities involve a combination of both development and production contracts with varying delivery schedules 
some of its more significant programs  including the thaad system  the aegis weapon system  and the littoral combat ship program  demonstrate the diverse products and services electronic systems provides 
electronic systems operating results included the following in millions net sales operating profit operating margin backlog at year end net sales for electronic systems increased by in compared to sales increased in all three lines of business during the year 
the million increase at gt l primarily was due to growth on readiness and stability operations  which partially was offset by lower volume on simulation training programs 
the million increase at m fc primarily was due to higher volume on tactical missile and air defense programs  which partially was offset by a decline in volume on fire control systems 
the million increase at ms mainly was due to higher volume on surface naval warfare  ship aviation systems  and radar systems programs  which partially was offset by lower volume on undersea warfare programs 
net sales for electronic systems increased by in compared to sales increases in m fc and gt l more than offset a decline in ms the million increase in sales at m fc primarily was due to growth on tactical missile programs and fire control systems 
the million increase at gt l primarily was due to growth on simulation and training activities and readiness and stability operations 
the increase in simulation and training also included sales from the first quarter acquisition of universal systems and technology  inc the million decrease at ms mainly was due to lower volume on ship aviation systems and undersea warfare programs  which partially were offset by higher volume on radar systems and surface naval warfare programs 
operating profit for the segment increased by in compared to operating profit increases at m fc and gt l more than offset a decline at ms the million increase at m fc mainly was due to higher volume and improved performance on certain tactical missile programs and higher volume on air defense programs 
the million increase at gt l primarily was attributable to higher volume on readiness and stability operations and improved performance on simulation and training programs 
these increases more than offset declines due to lower volume and performance on other logistics programs and the absence in of a benefit recognized in the first quarter of from favorably resolving a contract matter at simulation training programs 
the million decrease in operating profit at ms mainly was due to lower volume and performance on undersea warfare programs and a decrease in the level of favorable performance adjustments on surface naval warfare programs in these declines partially were offset by higher volume and improved performance on ship aviation systems and radar systems programs in operating profit for the segment increased by in compared to in  increases in operating profit at m fc and gt l more than offset declines at ms operating profit increased million at m fc mainly due to higher volume and improved performance on fire control systems and tactical missile programs 
the increase in operating profit of million at gt l primarily was due to higher volume and improved performance on simulation and training programs and readiness and stability operations 
additionally  the increase included a benefit recognized in from favorably resolving a simulation and training contract matter 
these increases partially were offset by lower volume and performance on other logistics programs 
there was a million decrease in operating profit at ms  which primarily was attributable to lower volume on ship aviation programs and a reduction in the level of favorable performance adjustments on ship aviation systems and undersea warfare programs in compared to backlog increased in compared to primarily from increased orders for air defense and tactical missile programs at m fc and readiness and stability operations at gt l 
these increases partially were offset by higher sales volume on ship aviation systems and surface naval warfare programs at ms backlog decreased in compared to 
table of contents due to the us government s exercise of the termination for convenience clause on the vh presidential helicopter program at ms  which resulted in a million reduction 
this decline more than offset increased orders on air defense and tactical missile programs at m fc and simulation and training activities at gt l 
we expect electronic systems sales to decline in in the low single digit percentage range as compared to the decline primarily is due to our completion of the persistent threat detection system ptds program in  coupled with the delayed timing of awards such as the littoral combat ship and certain missile defense contracts 
we expect the decline to be partially offset by growth in readiness and stability contracts 
operating profit is expected to decline in line with sales  with operating margins expected to be similar to those in information systems global solutions our is gs business segment provides management services  information technology it solutions  and advanced technology expertise across a broad spectrum of applications to us government and other customers 
the segment operates in the civil  defense  and intelligence lines of business 
is gs key programs and activities include the en route automation modernization eram program  the airborne maritime fixed joint tactical radio system jtrs program  the hanford mission support contract  and the decennial response integration system dris program 
the dris program substantially was completed in is gs programs also include a large number of idiq and task order types of contracts across each of its lines of business 
is gs operating results included the following in millions net sales operating profit operating margin backlog at year end net sales for is gs increased by in compared to sales increased in civil and defense but declined in intelligence during the year 
civil increased million principally due to higher volume on enterprise civilian services 
defense sales increased million primarily due to higher volume on mission and combat systems activities 
the million decline in intelligence programs mainly was due to lower volume on security solutions 
net sales for is gs increased by in compared to sales increased in all three lines of business during the year 
net sales at civil increased by million principally due to higher volume on enterprise civilian services

the million increase in intelligence mainly was due to higher volume on security solutions 
operating profit for the segment decreased by in compared to for the year  operating profit declines in defense more than offset an increase in civil  while operating profit at intelligence essentially was unchanged 
the million decrease in operating profit at defense primarily was attributable to a decrease in the level of favorable performance adjustments on mission and combat systems activities in the million increase in civil principally was due to higher volume on enterprise civilian services 
operating profit for the segment decreased by in compared to operating profit declines in civil and intelligence partially were offset by growth in defense 
the decrease of million in civil s operating profit primarily was attributable to a reduction in the level of favorable performance adjustments on enterprise civilian services programs in compared to the decrease in operating profit of million at intelligence mainly was due to a reduction in the level of favorable performance adjustments on security solution activities in compared to the increase in defense s operating profit of million mainly was due to volume and improved performance in mission and combat systems 
the decrease in backlog during compared to mainly was due to higher sales volume on enterprise civilian service programs at civil  including volume associated with the dris program  and mission and combat system programs at defense 
backlog decreased in compared to due to us government s exercise of the termination for convenience clause on the tsat mission operations system tmos contract at defense  which resulted in a billion reduction in orders 
this decline more than offset increased orders on enterprise civilian services programs at civil 
we expect is gs will experience a low single digit percentage decrease in sales for as compared to this decline primarily is due to completion of most of the work associated with the dris program 
operating profit in is expected to decline in relationship to the decline in sales volume  while operating margins are expected to be comparable between the years 

table of contents space systems our space systems business segment is engaged in the design  research and development  engineering  and production of satellites  strategic and defensive missile systems  and space transportation systems  including activities related to the planned replacement of the space shuttle 
government satellite programs include the advanced extremely high frequency aehf system  the mobile user objective system muos  the global positioning satellite iii gps iii system  the space based infrared system sbirs  and the geostationary operational environmental satellite r series goes r 
strategic and missile defense programs include the targets and countermeasures program and the fleet ballistic missile program

the space shuttle is expected to complete its final flight mission in and our involvement with its launch and processing activities will end at that time 
space systems operating results included the following in millions net sales operating profit operating margin backlog at year end net sales for space systems decreased by in compared to sales declined in all three lines of business during the year 
the million decrease in space transportation principally was due to lower volume on the space shuttle external tank  commercial launch vehicle activity and other human space flight programs  which partially were offset by higher volume on the orion program 
there were no commercial launches in compared to one commercial launch in strategic defensive missile systems s dms sales declined million principally due to lower volume on defensive missile programs 
the million sales decline in satellites primarily was attributable to lower volume on commercial satellites  which partially were offset by higher volume on government satellite activities 
there was one commercial satellite delivery in and one commercial satellite delivery in net sales for space systems increased in compared to during the year  sales growth at satellites and space transportation offset a decline in s dms 
the sales growth of million in satellites was due to higher volume in government satellite activities  which partially was offset by lower volume in commercial satellite activities 
there was one commercial satellite delivery in and two deliveries in the increase in sales of million in space transportation primarily was due to higher volume on the orion program  which more than offset a decline in the space shuttle s external tank program 
there was one commercial launch in both and s dms sales decreased by million mainly due to lower volume on defensive missile programs  which more than offset growth in strategic missile programs 
operating profit for the segment was unchanged for compared to growth in space transportation s operating profit was more than offset by a decline in satellites operating profit 
s dms operating profit was relatively unchanged between periods 
the million increase in space transportation mainly was attributable to higher equity earnings on the ula and usa joint ventures and higher volume on the orion program  which partially were offset by lower volume on the space shuttle s external tank program

table of contents backlog increased in compared to mainly due to orders exceeding sales on government satellite programs in satellites and strategic missile programs in s dms  which more than offset higher sales volume compared to new orders on the orion program in space transportation in the decrease in backlog during compared to was primarily attributable to declines in orders and higher sales volume on the orion program in space transportation and on government satellite programs in satellites 
we expect space systems sales for will be comparable with the results 
sales are expected to decline due to the end of our production of the external tank for the space shuttle  offset by growth in satellite activities 
segment operating profit is expected to be down slightly primarily due to lower anticipated levels of equity earnings from our ownership interest in usa  which provides processing activities for the space shuttle 
usa s activities will be winding down as the space shuttle s last flight will be in segment operating margin is expected to slightly decline due to the lower equity earnings 
unallocated corporate income expense  net the following table shows the components of unallocated corporate income expense  net  including the cas expense that is included as expense in the segments operating results  the related fas pension expense  and the resulting fas cas pension adjustment

the approximate amounts of the vesp attributable to our business segments were as follows aeronautics million  electronic systems million  is gs million  and space systems million 
the remaining million was attributable to corporate 
fas pension expense increased in compared to  and in compared to  due to the basis point decrease in the discount rate each year and continued amortization of the actuarial losses incurred in as a result of the significant negative return on plan assets compared to our long term rate of return assumption see the related discussion in critical accounting policies under the caption postretirement benefit plans 
certain items are excluded from segment results as part of senior management s evaluation of segment operating performance consistent with the management approach permitted by gaap  such as the charges related to the vesp and the ms consolidation of facilities in see note  gains or losses from divestitures  the effects of legal settlements  corporate costs not allocated to the business segments  and other miscellaneous corporate activities 
the charges related to the vesp and the ms consolidation of facilities are presented together on a separate line item in the table above 
on a combined basis  these items decreased net earnings for by million

in  there were no such items included in unallocated corporate income expense  net 
the change in the other  net component of unallocated corporate income expense  net  between the periods primarily was due to higher expense associated with a number of corporate activities 

table of contents liquidity and cash flows our access to capital resources that provide liquidity has not been materially affected by the changing economic and market conditions over the past few years 
we continually monitor changes in such conditions so that we can timely respond to any related developments 
we have generated strong operating cash flows which have been the primary source of funding for our operations  debt service and repayments  capital expenditures  share repurchases  dividends  acquisitions  and postretirement benefit plan funding 
we have accessed the capital markets on limited occasions  as needed or when opportunistic 
we issued million of notes in exchange for million of our then outstanding debt securities in see note  billion of debt securities in  and million of debt securities in we expect our cash from operations to continue to be sufficient to support our operations and anticipated capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
we have financing resources available to fund potential cash outflows that are less predictable or more discretionary  as discussed under capital structure  resources  and other 
we have access to the credit markets  if needed  for liquidity or general corporate purposes  including letters of credit to support customer advance payments and for other trade finance purposes such as guaranteeing our performance on particular contracts 
cash received from customers  either from the payment of invoices for work performed or for advances in excess of costs incurred  is our primary source of cash 
we generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer 
billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors  including the contract type 
we generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost reimbursable and time and materials contracts  which together represent approximately of the revenues we recorded in  as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred or work is performed 
in contrast to cost reimbursable contracts  for fixed price contracts we generally do not bill until milestones  including deliveries  are achieved 
a number of our fixed price contracts may provide for performance based payments which allow us to bill and collect cash as we perform on the contract 
the us government recently has indicated that it would consider progress payments as the baseline for negotiating consideration for different payment terms on contracts  such as performance based payments 
the use of progress payments could delay the collection of receivables on certain of our contracts in future periods 
fixed price contracts represented approximately of the revenues we recorded in the majority of our capital expenditures for and those planned for can be divided into the categories of facilities infrastructure  equipment  and information technology it 
expenditures for facilities infrastructure and equipment are generally incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments 
for example  we have projects underway in our aeronautics business segment for facilities and equipment to support production of the f combat aircraft 
in addition  we have projects underway to modernize certain of our facilities 
we also incur capital expenditures for it to support programs and general enterprise it infrastructure 
we have a balanced cash deployment and disciplined growth strategy to enhance shareholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise 
consistent with that strategy  we have invested in our business  including capital expenditures and independent research and development  repurchased shares  increased our dividends  made selective acquisitions of businesses  and managed our debt levels 
the following table provides a summary of our cash flow information and the subsequent discussion provides an overview of our execution of this strategy 
in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for investing activities net cash used for financing activities operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by million to  million in as compared to the increase primarily was attributable to an improvement in our operating working capital balances of million as discussed below  and million related to lower net income tax payments  as compared to partially offsetting these improvements was a net reduction in cash from operations of million related to our defined benefit pension plan 
this reduction was the result of increased contributions to the pension trust of million as compared to  partially offset by an increase in the cas costs recovered on our contracts 
operating working capital accounts consists of receivables  inventories  accounts payable  and customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred 
the improvement in cash provided by operating working capital was due to a decline in accounts receivable balances compared to  and an increase in customer advances and amounts in excess of 
table of contents costs incurred balances compared to these improvements partially were offset by a decline in accounts payable balances in compared to the decline in accounts receivable primarily was due to higher collections on various programs at electronic systems  is gs  and space systems business areas 
the increase in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred primarily was attributable to an increase on government and commercial satellite programs at space systems and air mobility programs at aeronautics  partially offset by a decrease on various programs at electronic systems 
the decrease in accounts payable was attributable to the timing of accounts payable activities across all segments 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased by  million to  million in as compared to the decline primarily was attributable to an increase in our contributions to the defined benefit pension plan of  million as compared to and an increase in our operating working capital accounts of million 
partially offsetting these items was the impact of lower net income tax payments in as compared to in the amount of million 
the decline in cash provided by operating working capital primarily was due to growth of receivables on various programs in the ms and gt l lines of business at electronic systems and an increase in inventories on combat aircraft programs at aeronautics  which partially were offset by increases in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred on government satellite programs at space systems and the timing of accounts payable activities 
investing activities capital expenditures the majority of our capital expenditures relate to facilities infrastructure and equipment that are incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments 
we also incur capital expenditures for it to support programs and general enterprise it infrastructure 
capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment amounted to million in  million in  and million in we expect that our operating cash flows will continue to be sufficient to fund our annual capital expenditures over the next few years 
acquisitions  divestitures and other activities acquisition activities include both the acquisition of businesses and investments in affiliates 
amounts paid in of million primarily related to investments in affiliates 
we paid million in for acquisition activities  compared with million in in  we received proceeds of million from the sale of eig  net of million in transaction costs see note 
there were no material divestiture activities in and during  we increased our short term investments by million compared to an increase of million in financing activities share activity and dividends during   and  we repurchased million  million  and million shares of our common stock for  million   million  and  million 
of the shares we repurchased in  million shares for million were repurchased in december but settled and were paid for in january in october  our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of our common stock from time to time  up to an authorized amount of billion see note 
under the program  we have discretion to determine the dollar amount of shares to be repurchased and the timing of any repurchases in compliance with applicable law and regulation 
we repurchased a total of million shares under the program for million  and as of december   there remained  million available for additional share repurchases 
in connection with their approval of the new share repurchase program  our board terminated our previous share repurchase program 
cash received from the issuance of our common stock in connection with stock option exercises during   and totaled million  million  and million 
those activities resulted in the issuance of million shares  million shares  and million shares during the respective periods 
shareholders were paid cash dividends of million in  million in  and million in we have increased our quarterly dividend rate in each of the last three years

issuance and repayment of long term debt in connection with the debt exchange completed in may see note  we paid a total of million for a portion of the premium associated with the transaction and related expenses incurred with third parties 
we issued a total of billion of long term notes in see note and million of long term notes in there were no repayments of long term debt in  and there are no scheduled maturity payments due prior 
table of contents to in  we paid million in repayments of long term debt based on scheduled maturities 
in  we paid a total of billion representing the principal amount of our floating rate convertible debentures that were delivered for conversion or otherwise redeemed 
we also paid another million during related to other repayments of long term debt based on scheduled maturities 
capital structure  resources  and other at december   we held cash and cash equivalents of billion and short term investments of million 
our long term debt  net of unamortized discounts  amounted to billion 
as of the end of  our long term debt bears interest at fixed rates and mainly is in the form of publicly issued notes and debentures 
we issued million of new notes due the new notes in may in exchange for million of our then outstanding debt securities see note 
we paid a premium of million  of which million was in the form of new notes and million was paid in cash  which was recorded as a discount and will be amortized as additional interest expense over the life of the new notes using the effective interest method 
the new notes are included on our balance sheet net of the unamortized discount 
in november  we issued a total of billion of long term notes in a registered public offering see note  million of which are due in and have a fixed coupon interest rate of  and million of which are due in and have a fixed coupon interest rate of 
our stockholders equity was billion at december   a decrease of million from december  the decrease primarily was due to the repurchase of million common shares for billion  the payment of million of dividends during the year  and adjustments related to our postretirement benefit plans at december see note which on a net basis increased the accumulated other comprehensive loss by million 
these decreases partially were offset by net earnings of billion and employee stock activity of million 
as we repurchase our common shares  we reduce common stock for the of par value of the shares repurchased  with the remainder of the purchase price over par value recorded as a reduction of additional paid in capital 
due to the volume of repurchases made under our share repurchase programs  additional paid in capital was reduced to zero  with the remainder of the excess of purchase price over par value of billion recorded as a reduction of retained earnings 
at december   we had in place with a group of banks a billion revolving credit facility which expires in june there were no borrowings outstanding under the facility during the year ended december  borrowings under the credit facility would be unsecured and bear interest at rates based  at our option  on the eurodollar rate or a bank defined base rate 
each bank s obligation to make loans under the credit facility is subject to  among other things  our compliance with various representations  warranties and covenants  including covenants limiting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to encumber our assets  and a covenant not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio 
the leverage ratio covenant excludes the adjustments recognized in stockholders equity related to our postretirement benefit plans 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the credit facility agreement 
we have agreements in place with banking institutions to provide for the issuance of commercial paper 
there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding during the year ended december  if we were to issue commercial paper  the borrowings would be supported by the billion revolving credit facility 
we also have an effective shelf registration statement on form s on file with the securities and exchange commission to provide for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities 
we actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable 
we review changes in financial market  and economic conditions to manage the types  amounts  and maturities of our indebtedness 
we may at times refinance existing indebtedness  vary our mix of variable rate and fixed rate debt  or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs 
return on invested capital roic declined by basis points during to 
the decline was primarily driven by the issuance of billion in debt securities in november and lower net earnings in compared to we define roic as net earnings plus after tax interest expense divided by average invested capital stockholders equity plus debt  after adjusting stockholders equity by adding back amounts related to postretirement benefit plans 
we believe that reporting roic provides investors with greater visibility into how effectively we use the capital invested in our operations 
we use roic as one of the inputs in our evaluation of multi year investment decisions and as a long term performance measure 
we also use roic as a factor in evaluating management performance under certain of our incentive compensation plans 

table of contents roic is not a measure of financial performance under us generally accepted accounting principles  and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner 
roic should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of performance 
roic for  and was calculated as follows in millions net earnings interest expense multiplied by return average debt  average equity  average benefit plan adjustments  average invested capital return on invested capital represents after tax interest expense utilizing the federal statutory rate of 
interest expense is added back to net earnings as it represents the return to debt holders 
debt is included as a component of average invested capital 
debt consists of long term debt  including current maturities of long term debt  and short term borrowings if any 
equity includes non cash adjustments  primarily related to benefit plan adjustments as discussed in note below 
average benefit plan adjustments reflect the cumulative value of entries identified in our statements of stockholders equity related to adjustments to recognize the funded status of our benefit plans 
the total of annual benefit plan adjustments to equity were million  million  and  million 
as these entries are recorded in the fourth quarter  the value added back to our average equity in a given year is the cumulative impact of all prior year entries plus of the current year entry value 
the cumulative impact of benefit plan adjustments through december  was  million 
yearly averages are calculated using balances at the start of the year and at the end of each quarter 
contractual commitments and off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had contractual commitments to repay debt  make payments under operating leases  settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services  and settle tax and other liabilities 
capital lease obligations were negligible 
payments due under these obligations and commitments are as follows payments due by period in millions total less than year years and years and after years long term debt a interest payments other liabilities operating lease obligations purchase obligations operating activities capital expenditures total contractual cash obligations a the total amount of long term debt excludes the unamortized discount of million see note 
generally  our long term debt obligations are subject to  along with other things  compliance with certain covenants  including covenants limiting our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to encumber our assets 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our debt agreements 
interest payments include interest related to the outstanding debt through maturity 
amounts related to other liabilities represent the contractual obligations for certain long term liabilities recorded as of december  such amounts mainly include expected payments under deferred compensation plans  non qualified pension plans  environmental liabilities  and business acquisition agreements 
obligations related to environmental liabilities represent our estimate of obligations for sites at which we are performing remediation activities  excluding amounts reimbursed by the us government in its capacity as a potentially responsible party 
the amounts also include liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits see note 
we estimated the timing of tax payments based on the expected completion of the related examinations by the applicable taxing authorities and resolution of issues pending in the internal revenue service appeals division 

table of contents purchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and requirements contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages 
such agreements and contracts may  for example  be related to direct materials  obligations to subcontractors  and outsourcing arrangements 
total purchase obligations in the preceding table include approximately billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our us government customers 
the us government generally would be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts for convenience under the far  subject to available funding 
this also would be true in cases where we perform subcontract work for a prime contractor under a us government contract 
the termination for convenience language also may be included in contracts with foreign  state  and local governments 
we also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions  including contracts with commercial customers 
purchase obligations in the preceding table for capital expenditures generally include amounts for facilities and equipment related to customer contracts 
we also may enter into industrial cooperation agreements  sometimes referred to as offset agreements  as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries 
these agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country 
offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash  including transferring technology  providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in country projects  and the purchase by third parties eg  our vendors of supplies from in country vendors 
these agreements also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in country vendors  providing financial support for in country projects  and building or leasing facilities for in country operations 
we typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive 
the amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement 
at december   we had outstanding offset agreements totaling billion  primarily related to our aeronautics segment  some of which extend through to the extent we have entered into purchase obligations at december  that also satisfy offset agreements  those amounts are included in the preceding table 
offset programs usually extend over several years and may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements 
we historically have not been required to pay material penalties 
in connection with our ownership of united launch alliance  llc ula  we and the boeing company boeing each committed to provide up to million in financial support to ula  as required  until at least december  we had a revolving credit agreement with ula in place through september  no amounts were drawn on the credit agreement 
on september   ula entered into with a group of banks its own million revolving credit agreement which expires in october at the same time  the revolving credit agreement we and boeing had in place was terminated 
the new revolving credit agreement satisfies boeing s and our commitment to provide financial support of up to million each to ula  so long as the total amount of the new agreement remains at million or above until at least december  we and boeing have received distributions totaling million each which are subject to agreements between us  boeing  and ula whereby  if ula does not have sufficient cash resources or credit capacity to make payments under the inventory supply agreement it has with boeing  both we and boeing would provide to ula  in the form of an additional capital contribution  the level of funding required for ula to make those payments 
any such capital contributions would not exceed the amount of the distributions subject to the agreements 
we currently believe that ula will have sufficient operating cash flows and credit capacity to meet its obligations  so that we will not be required to make a contribution under these agreements 
in addition  we  boeing  and ula have cross indemnifications in place with ula related to financial support arrangements eg  letters of credit  surety bonds  or foreign exchange contracts and guarantees by us and boeing of the performance and financial obligations of ula under certain launch service contracts 
we believe ula will be able to fully perform its obligations  as it has done through december   and that it will not be necessary to make payments under the cross indemnities 

table of contents we have entered into standby letters of credit  surety bonds  and third party guarantees with financial institutions and other third parties primarily relating to advances received from customers and or the guarantee of future performance on certain of our contracts 
in some cases  we may guarantee the contractual performance of third parties such as joint venture partners 
at december   we had the following outstanding letters of credit  surety bonds  and guarantees commitment expiration by period in millions total commitment less than year a years and a years and a after years a standby letters of credit surety bonds guarantees total commitments a approximately  million  million  million  and million of standby letters of credit in the less than year  years and  years and  and after years periods  and approximately million of surety bonds in the less than year period  are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation 
included in the table above is approximately million representing letter of credit amounts for which related obligations or liabilities are also recorded on the balance sheet  either as reductions of inventories  as customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred  or as other liabilities 
approximately billion of the standby letters of credit were issued to secure advance payments received under an f contract from an international customer 
these letters of credit are available for draw down in the event of our nonperformance  and the amount available will be reduced as certain events occur throughout the period of performance in accordance with the contract terms 
similar to the letters of credit for the f contract  other letters of credit and surety bonds are available for draw down in the event of our nonperformance 
approximately of the billion in third party guarantees outstanding at december  related to guarantees of the contractual performance of joint ventures to which we are a party 
this amount represents our estimate of the maximum amount we would expect to incur upon the contractual non performance of our joint venture partners 
we evaluate the reputation  technical capabilities  and credit quality of potential joint venture partners 
in addition  we generally have cross indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner 
we believe our current joint venture partners will be able to perform their obligations  as they have done through december   and that it will not be necessary to make payments under the guarantees 
critical accounting policies contract accounting sales recognition approximately of our net sales are derived from long term contracts for design  development  and production activities also referred to as dd p contracts which we account for under the percentage of completion poc accounting model 
the poc model requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made in accounting for the contracts 
our remaining net sales are derived from contracts to provide other services that are not associated with design  development  or production activities which we account for under the services accounting model 
we consider the nature of our contracts and the types of products and services provided when we determine the accounting method for a particular contract 
most of our long term contracts are denominated in us dollars  including contracts for sales of military products and services to foreign governments conducted through the us government 
we record sales for both dd p activities and services under cost reimbursable  fixed price  and time and materials contracts 
contract types cost reimbursable contracts cost reimbursable contracts  which accounted for about of our total net sales over the last three years  provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee  up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded 
we generate revenue under two general types of cost reimbursable contracts cost plus award fee incentive fee which represent a substantial majority of our cost reimbursable contracts and cost plus fixed fee contracts 
cost plus award fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer s assessment of our performance against a predetermined set of criteria  such as targets based on cost  quality  technical  and schedule criteria 
cost plus incentive fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs incentive based on cost or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets incentive based on performance 
the fixed fee in a cost plus fixed fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed fee does not vary with actual costs 

table of contents fixed price and other contracts under fixed price contracts  which accounted for about of our total net sales over the last three years  we agree to perform the specified work for a pre determined price 
to the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated  we will generate more or less profit  or could incur a loss 
some fixed price contracts have a performance based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance 
under time and materials contracts  which accounted for about of our total net sales over the last three years  we are paid a fixed hourly rate for each direct labor hour expended  and we are reimbursed for allowable material costs and allowable out of pocket expenses 
to the extent our actual direct labor and associated costs vary in relation to the fixed hourly billing rates provided in the contract  we will generate more or less profit  or could incur a loss 
design  development  and production contracts we record net sales and an estimated profit on a poc basis for cost reimbursable and fixed price dd p contracts 
sales are recorded on time and materials contracts as the work is performed based on agreed upon hourly rates and allowable costs 
the poc method for dd p contracts depends on the nature of the products provided under the contract 
for example  for contracts that require us to perform a significant level of development effort in comparison to the total value of the contract and or to deliver minimal quantities  sales are recorded using the cost to cost method to measure progress toward completion 
under the cost to cost method of accounting  we recognize sales and an estimated profit as costs are incurred based on the proportion that the incurred costs bear to total estimated costs 
for contracts that require us to provide a substantial number of similar items without a significant level of development  we record sales and an estimated profit on a percentage of completion basis using units of delivery as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract 
when adjustments in estimated contract revenues or estimated costs at completion are required on dd p contracts  any changes from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inception to date effect of the changes 
when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned  a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined 
award fees and incentives  as well as penalties related to contract performance  are considered in estimating sales and profit rates on dd p contracts 
estimates of award fees are based on past experience and anticipated performance 
we record incentives or penalties when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance 
incentive provisions that increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event are not recognized until the event occurs 
for contract change orders  claims  or similar items  we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
we have accounting policies in place to address these  as well as other contractual and business arrangements to properly account for long term contracts 
accounting for dd p contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract revenues and costs including estimating award and incentive fees and penalties related to performance  and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
due to the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on many of our contracts  the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
contract costs include material  labor  and subcontracting costs  as well as an allocation of indirect costs 
we have to make assumptions regarding labor productivity and availability  the complexity of the work to be performed  the availability of materials  the length of time to complete the contract to estimate increases in wages and prices for materials  performance by our subcontractors  and the availability and timing of funding from our customer  among other variables 
because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes in our accounting for dd p contracts  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if our underlying circumstances were to change 
for example  if underlying assumptions were to change such that our estimated profit rate at completion for all dd p contracts was higher or lower by one percentage point  our net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately million 
services contracts for cost reimbursable contracts for services that provide for award and incentive fees  we record net sales as services are performed  except for award and incentive fees 
award and incentive fees are recorded when they are fixed or determinable  generally at the date the amount is communicated to us by the customer 
this approach results in the 
table of contents recognition of such fees at contractual intervals typically every six months throughout the contract and is dependent on the customer s processes for notification of awards and issuance of formal notifications 
under a fixed price service contract  we are paid a predetermined fixed amount for a specified scope of work and generally have full responsibility for the costs associated with the contract and the resulting profit or loss 
we record net sales under fixed price service contracts on a straight line basis over the period of contract performance  unless evidence suggests that net sales are earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
costs for all service contracts are expensed as incurred 
the majority of our service contracts are in our is gs segment 
change in revenue recognition on service contracts with the us government effective january   we changed our methodology for recognizing net sales for service contracts with the us government 
we will recognize sales on those contracts using the poc method similar to our dd p contracts as described above 
as such  we expect that over of our consolidated net sales will be recognized using the poc method 
we believe the poc method is preferable  as consistent revenue recognition application across all contracts with the us government better reflects the underlying economics of those contracts and aligns our financial reporting with others in our industry 
beginning with our first quarter financial statements  all prior periods presented will be retrospectively adjusted to apply the new method of accounting 
the effect of this change is expected to be less than one percent of net sales and segment operating profit in  and was not material to prior periods 
other contract accounting considerations the majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the us government 
cost based pricing is determined under the federal acquisition regulation far 
the far provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under us government contracts 
for example  costs such as those related to charitable contributions  interest expense  and certain advertising and public relations activities are unallowable  and therefore not recoverable through sales 
in addition  we may enter into advance agreements with the us government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters 
for example  most of the environmental costs we incur for groundwater treatment and soil remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under far provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the us government 
we closely monitor compliance with  and the consistent application of  our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting 
business segment personnel evaluate our contracts through periodic contract status and performance reviews 
also  regular and recurring evaluations of contract cost  scheduling  and technical matters are performed by management personnel independent from the business segment performing work under the contract 
costs incurred and allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with us government regulations by our personnel  and are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency 
postretirement benefit plans most of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans  and we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees collectively  postretirement benefit plans see note 
the impact of these plans and benefits on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because those calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions and workforce demographics 
we recognize on a plan by plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans under gaap as either an asset or liability on our balance sheets  with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  in stockholders equity 
the funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan s assets and the benefit obligation of the plan as determined under gaap 
actuarial assumptions gaap requires that the amounts we record related to our plans be computed using actuarial valuations 
the primary year end assumptions used to estimate postretirement benefit plan expense for the following calendar year are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets for all postretirement benefit plans  the rates of increase in future compensation levels for the participants in our defined benefit pension plans  and the health care cost trend rates for our retiree medical plans 
the discount rate we select impacts both the calculation of the benefit obligation at the end of the year and the calculation of net postretirement benefit plan cost in the subsequent year 
the difference between the long term rate of return on plan assets assumption we select and the actual return on plan assets in any given year affects both the funded status of our benefit plans and the calculation of net postretirement benefit plan cost in subsequent years 
we use judgment in 
table of contents reassessing these assumptions each year because we have to consider past and current market conditions  and make judgments about future market trends 
we also have to consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants 
we selected as the discount rate for calculating our benefit obligations at december   compared to at the end of and at the end of we evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate discount rate  including results from cash flow models  quoted rates from long term bond indices  and changes in long term bond rates over the past year 
as part of our evaluation  we calculate the approximate average yields on securities that were selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flows 
our postretirement benefit plan cash flows are input into actuarial models that include data for corporate bonds rated aa or better 
we concluded that was a reasonable estimate for the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption at december   consistent with the rate used at december  the long term rate of return assumption represents the expected average rate of earnings on the funds invested  or to be invested  to provide for the benefits included in the plan obligation 
this assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns  the anticipated long term allocation of plan assets  the historical return data for the trust funds  plan expenses  and the potential to outperform market index returns 
the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption  but the average expected return over a long term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption 
as a result  changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate 
any variance in a given year should not  by itself  suggest that the assumption should be changed 
patterns of variances are reviewed over time and then combined with expectations for the future 
our stockholders equity decreased on a net basis by million at december  due to two noncash  after tax adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the annual remeasurement of our postretirement benefit plans 
the first adjustment decreased stockholders equity by million and was driven by the decline in the discount rate used to calculate postretirement benefit liabilities  partially offset by the effects of the approximate actual return on plan assets resulting from market conditions in the amount primarily represents net actuarial gains and losses resulting from the differences between actual experience and our actuarial assumptions  which will be amortized to expense in future periods 
the second adjustment increased stockholders equity by million and represents the recognition in earnings of amounts which were recorded as a component of stockholders equity in prior years 
these amounts primarily related to investment losses in on the assets held in trust to support our postretirement benefit plans  partially offset by the effects of investment gains in and each as compared to our long term rate of return assumption 
we also expect that our pension expense will increase to  million as compared with pension expense of  million  primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate  together with the net effect of the recognition of the investment losses  partially offset by the effects of investment gains in and as discussed above 
for a discussion of changes in pension expense over the past three years  see the discussion under the caption unallocated corporate income expense  net 
the discount rate assumption we select at the end of each year is based on our best estimates and judgment 
a reasonably possible change of plus or minus basis points in the discount rate assumption at december   with all other assumptions held constant  would have decreased or increased the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of by over billion  which would have resulted in an after tax increase or decrease in stockholders equity at the end of the year of approximately million 
if the discount rate at december  that was used to compute expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been basis points higher or lower  with all other assumptions held constant  the amount of expense projected for would be lower or higher by approximately million 
funding considerations the pension plan funding legislation enacted in  known as the pension protection act  had the effect of accelerating the required amount of annual pension plan contributions most companies were required to pay  beginning in the new funding requirements for large us defense contractors like us were delayed until the earlier of or the year in which required changes to the us government cost accounting standards cas rules became effective 
the legislation also required the cas board to modify its pension accounting rules by to better align the recovery of pension contributions on us government contracts with the new accelerated funding requirements 
to date  the cas board has not published final changes to its pension accounting rules  and therefore  we currently do not expect that the revised rules will be effective until after the pension protection act will become applicable to us and other large us defense contractors beginning in 
table of contents cas rules are a major factor we consider in determining our total pension funding and govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the us government 
funded amounts are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on us government contracts  and are recognized in our net sales 
the amount of funding required under cas for our qualified defined benefit pension plans for  and therefore the amount included in our segments operating results for the year  was million 
for  we expect the funding required under cas will be about million 
additional funding requirements computed under the internal revenue code irc rules  as well as discretionary payments  are considered to be prepayments under the cas rules to the extent the amounts exceed cas funding requirements 
as noted above  the results of operations of our segments include pension expense only as determined and funded in accordance with cas rules 
the fas cas pension adjustment represents the difference between pension expense calculated in accordance with gaap and pension costs calculated and funded in accordance with cas 
because our fas pension expense is estimated to be  million and our cas pension expense is expected to be million  we estimate that the fas cas pension adjustment will be million  compared to million in the fas cas pension adjustment is included in unallocated corporate income expense  net for purposes of our segment reporting 
in   and  we made discretionary contributions of  million   million  and million related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans 
we expect to make contributions of billion related to those plans in we also may review options for further contributions in our inability to allocate the accelerated funding required under the pension protection act in the pricing of our products and services on us government contracts in the period during which the funding is required will have the effect of increasing the amount of the fas cas pension expense that is charged to earnings in and negatively affecting our cash from operations 
we anticipate recovering approximately million as cas cost during as compared to our estimated funding of billion  with the remainder being recoverable in future years 
environmental matters we are a party to various agreements  proceedings  and potential proceedings for environmental cleanup issues  including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party prp by the epa or by a state agency 
at the end of  the total amount of liabilities recorded on our balance sheet for environmental matters was million 
we have recorded assets totaling million at december  for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for agencies of the us government  as discussed below 
the amount that is expected to be allocated to our non us government contracts or that is determined to be unallowable for pricing under us government contracts has been expensed through cost of sales 
we enter into agreements eg  administrative orders  consent decrees that document the extent and timing of our environmental remediation obligation 
we also are involved in remediation activities at environmental sites where formal agreements either do not exist or do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligation 
environmental cleanup activities usually span many years  which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to  for example  changing remediation technologies 
to determine the costs related to cleanup sites  we have to assess the extent of contamination  effects on natural resources  the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation  and evolving regulatory environmental standards 
we perform quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites and record liabilities and assets in the period it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated see the discussion under environmental matters in notes and to the financial statements 
we consider the above factors in our quarterly estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remediation actions  which generally results in the calculation of a range of estimates for a particular environmental site 
we record a liability when it becomes probable that a liability has been incurred for the amount within the range that we determine to be our best estimate of the cost of remediation or  in cases where no amount within the range is better than another  an amount at the low end of the range 
we do not discount the recorded liabilities  as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined 
given the required level of judgment and estimation  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change eg  a change in environmental standards or a change in our estimate of the extent of contamination 
in january  both the epa and the california office of environmental health hazard assessment announced plans to regulate two chemicals  perchlorate and hexavalent chromium  to a level that is expected to be substantially lower than the 
table of contents existing standard established in california 
the rulemaking process is a lengthy one and may take one or more years to complete 
if a substantially lower standard is adopted  we would expect a material increase in our estimates for remediation at several existing sites 
under agreements reached with the us government  most of the amounts we spend for groundwater treatment and soil remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs 
under existing government regulations  these and other environmental expenditures relating to our us government business  after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other prps  are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services 
as a result  most of the expenditures we incur are included in our net sales and cost of sales according to us government agreement or regulation 
as disclosed above  we may record changes in the amount of environmental remediation liabilities as a result of our quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites  which would result in a change to the corresponding environmental asset and a charge to earnings 
for example  if we were to determine that the liabilities should be increased by million  the corresponding assets would be increased by approximately million  with the remainder recorded as a charge to earnings 
this allocation is determined annually  based upon our existing and projected business activities with the us government 
we cannot reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental sites with which we are involved 
there are a number of former operating facilities we are monitoring or investigating for potential future remediation 
in some cases  although a loss may be probable  it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activities because of uncertainties eg  assessing the extent of the contamination 
during any particular quarter  such uncertainties may be resolved to allow us to estimate and recognize the initial liability to remediate a particular former operating site 
the amount of the liability could be material 
upon recognition of the liability  a portion will be recognized as an asset with the remainder charged to operations 
if we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a prp  we expect that the actual costs of remediation will be shared with other liable prps 
generally  prps that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site cleanup and usually agree among themselves to share  on an allocated basis  the costs and expenses for investigation and remediation of hazardous materials 
under existing environmental laws  responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and  therefore  we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation 
in the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation  the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of contribution from the other prps 
the amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other prps  which we are required to pursue by agreement and us government regulation 
goodwill our goodwill at december  and amounted to billion and billion 
we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances could include significant changes in the business climate of our industry  operating performance indicators  competition  or sale or disposal of a portion of a reporting unit 
the assessment is performed at the reporting unit level 
our annual testing date is october performing the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including how we define reporting units and determine their fair value 
we consider a component of our business to be a reporting unit if it constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow methodology that requires significant judgment 
forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs  based primarily on existing firm orders  expected future orders  contracts with suppliers  labor agreements  and general market conditions 
the discount rate applied to our forecasts of future cash flows is based on our estimated weighted average cost of capital 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value  we measure impairment by comparing the derived fair value of goodwill to its carrying value  and any impairment determined is recorded in the current period 

table of contents we completed our assessment of goodwill as of october  and determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its corresponding carrying amount and  as such  no impairment existed at that date 
changes in estimates and assumptions we make in conducting our goodwill assessment could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 
however  we currently do not believe that any of our reporting units are at risk of failing a goodwill impairment test in the near term  as their fair value is significantly greater than their carrying value 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standard which revised its accounting guidance related to revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the standard relates to the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting and modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the individual deliverables  thereby affecting the timing of revenue recognition 
also  the standard expands the disclosure requirements for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the standard will be effective for us beginning on january   and will apply prospectively to certain multiple element arrangements with non us government customers entered into or materially modified after the adoption date 
we do not expect the adoption of this accounting standard will have a material effect on our financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain active relationships with a broad and diverse group of domestic and international financial institutions 
we believe that they provide us with sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct business 
we continue to closely monitor the financial market environment and actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring availability of  and access to  sufficient credit resources 
our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and market prices on certain equity securities 
our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed rate long term debt 
at december   the estimated fair value of our long term debt instruments was approximately billion  compared with a carrying value of billion  excluding the million unamortized discount 
we may use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
our foreign currency exchange contracts  the majority of which qualify for hedge accounting treatment  hedge the fluctuations in cash flows associated with firm commitments or specific anticipated transactions contracted in foreign currencies 
related gains and losses on these contracts  to the extent they are effective hedges  are recognized in earnings at the same time the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings 
to the extent the hedges are ineffective  gains and losses on the contracts are recognized in current period earnings 
the aggregate notional amount of the outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts at december  and was billion and billion 
there were no interest rate derivatives outstanding at december  and at december   the net fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding was not material see note 
we evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have acceptable credit risk at the time the agreements are executed 
our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several banks 
we periodically monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we maintain a rabbi trust that includes investments to fund certain of our non qualified deferred compensation plans 
as of december   investments in the rabbi trust totaled million and are reflected at fair value on our balance sheet in other assets 
the rabbi trust holds investments in marketable equity securities and fixed income securities that are exposed to price changes and changes in interest rates 
changes in the value of the rabbi trust are recognized on our statement of earnings in other non operating income expense  net 
during the year ended december   we recorded earnings totaling million related to the increase in the value of the rabbi trust assets 
we also contributed million to the rabbi trust in a portion of the liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the rabbi trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and certain market indices 
changes in the value of the deferred compensation liabilities are recognized on our statement of earnings in unallocated corporate costs 
the current portion of the deferred compensation plan liabilities is on our balance sheet in salaries  benefits  and payroll taxes  and the non current portion of the liability is on our balance sheet in other liabilities 
the resulting change in the value of the liabilities has the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the rabbi trust 
during the year ended december   we recorded expense of million related to the increase in the value of the deferred compensation liabilities
