critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories  warranty obligations  goodwill and intangible asset valuation  share based compensation and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the company s policy is to recognize revenue for product sales when evidence of an arrangement exists  sales price is determinable or fixed  title transfers and risk of loss has passed to the customer  which is generally upon shipment of the company s products to its customers 
the company defers and recognizes service revenue over the contractual period or as services are rendered 
some distributor agreements allow for potential return of products and provide price protection under certain conditions within limited time periods 
price protection is offered to select distributors for circumstances when there is a decrease in the list price of a product subsequent to the purchase by the distributor 
the distributor is entitled to receive a credit equal to the price decrease for all new and unused products held in the distributor s inventory as of the date of the claim  up to a maximum of days from the date of purchase 
such return rights are generally limited to short term stock rotation 
the company estimates sales returns and price adjustments based upon historical experience and other qualitative factors 
the company estimates expected sales returns and price protection adjustments and records the amounts as a reduction of revenue at the later of the time of shipment or when the pricing decision is made 
each period  price protection is estimated based upon pricing decisions made and information received from distributors as to the amount of inventory they are holding 
the company s policies comply with the guidance provided by the fasb accounting standards codification tm the codification or asc topic  revenue recognition asc topic 
judgments are required in evaluating the credit worthiness of the company s customers 
credit is not extended to customers and revenue is not recognized until the company has determined that the collection risk is minimal 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
where appropriate  the company obtains credit rating reports and financial statements of the customer when determining or modifying their credit limits 
the company regularly evaluates the collectability of its trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
when a customer s account balance becomes past due  the company initiates dialogue with the customer to determine the cause 
if it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation to the company  such as in the case of bankruptcy  deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position or other material events impacting their business  the company records a specific allowance to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company expects to recover 
the company also records an allowance for all customers based on certain other factors including the length of time the receivables are past due  the amount outstanding  and historical collection experience with customers 
the company believes its reported allowances are adequate 
however  if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  the company may need to record additional allowances which would result in additional operating expense being recorded for the period in which such determination was made 
inventories 
the company is exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of its inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage  or subject to lower of cost or market adjustments 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological and regulatory changes in the company s markets  the company s ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  changes to forecasts  new product introductions  quality issues with key suppliers  product phase outs  future customer service and repair requirements  and the availability of key components from the company s suppliers 
the company s policy is to reduce the value of inventory when conditions exist that suggest that its inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon its assumptions about future demand for its products and market conditions 
the company regularly evaluates its ability to realize the value of its inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
purchasing practices and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  the company s adjustments are intended to reduce the carrying value of its inventory to its net realizable value 
if actual demand for the company s products deteriorates or market conditions become less favorable than those that the company projects  additional inventory adjustments may be required 
product warranties 
the company s products are sold with warranty provisions that require it to remedy deficiencies in quality or performance over a specified period of time  generally between and months  at no cost to the company s customers 
the company s policy is to establish warranty reserves at levels that represent its estimate of the costs that will be incurred to fulfill those warranty requirements at the time that revenue is recognized 
the company believes that its recorded liabilities are adequate to cover its future cost of materials  labor and overhead for the servicing of its products 
if product failure rates  or material or service delivery costs differ from the company s estimates  its warranty liability would need to be revised accordingly 
intangible assets 
in accordance with asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc topic  the company does not amortize goodwill from acquisitions  but amortizes other acquisition related assets 
as required by these rules  the company performs an impairment review of goodwill annually or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
in the first quarter of the company determined that a triggering event had occurred and performed an impairment analysis 
as discussed in note impairment and restructuring charges  based on this review  the company determined that its goodwill was impaired  and therefore recorded a  charge to write off this balance 
the impairment review conducted in the second quarter of did not indicate impairment 
the company amortizes the cost of identifiable intangible assets over the estimated useful life of the asset and assesses any impairment by estimating the undiscounted future cash flows from the associated asset in accordance with asc topic and asc topic  property  plant  and equipment asc topic 
impairment charges related to the intangible assets associated with the acquisition of clarity and runco were recorded in fiscal based upon the impairment reviews performed in that year 
if the estimated cash flows related to these assets decreases in the future or the useful life is shorter than originally estimated  the company may incur further charges for impairment of these assets 
additional impairment could result if the associated products do not sell as expected 
share based compensation expense 
the company accounts for share based compensation in accordance with asc topic  compensation stock compensation  asc topic  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to the company s employees and directors including employee stock options  restricted stock and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan  based on estimated fair values 
the company estimates the fair value of employee stock options on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
this model is also used to estimate the fair value of employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan 
the determination of fair value using an option pricing model is affected by the company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding the risk free interest rate  the expected dividend yield  the expected option life  and expected volatility over the term of the awards 
the company estimates volatility based on its historical stock price volatility for a period consistent with the expected life of its options 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the company s employee stock options 
the dividend yield assumption is based on the company s history and expectation of dividend payouts 
the expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding based on historical experience 
as share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
the company values restricted stock awards at the closing price of the company s shares on the date of grant 
us generally accepted accounting principles gaap require forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical and anticipated future experience 
if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of asc topic in future periods  the compensation expense recorded may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period 
income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method outlined in asc topic  income taxes asc topic 
the company records a valuation allowance when necessary to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
if the company is able to realize the deferred tax assets in an amount in excess of its reported net amounts  an adjustment to decrease the valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets would increase earnings in the period such a determination was made 
similarly  if the company should determine that its net deferred tax assets may not be realized to the extent reported  an adjustment to increase the valuation allowance associated with the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such a determination was made
