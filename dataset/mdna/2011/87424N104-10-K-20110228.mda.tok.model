we deliver our solutions on demand as a service that is accessed through an internet connection and a standard web browser 
our solution delivery model  also called software as a service or saas  eliminates the need for our customers to install and maintain hardware and software in order to use our solutions 
we believe our saas model significantly reduces the time  cost and complexity associated with deployment in comparison to traditional  on premise software solutions  and generally offers a lower up front and total cost of ownership than traditional software solutions 
we offer our solutions as a subscription based service for which our customers pay a recurring annual or quarterly fee during the subscription term 
we market taleo enterprise  our suite of talent management solutions for medium and large enterprises with more complex needs  through our direct sales force and indirectly through our strategic partners

table of contents completed our acquisition of worldwide compensation  inc wwc on january   which allows us to directly offer a compensation management solution to larger  more complex organizations 
we market taleo business edition  our suite of talent management solutions for smaller more centralized organizations  primarily through our inside sales team and internet marketing efforts 
our customer base ranges in size from large  global organizations  including of the fortune  to small  private companies with few employees 
the talent management market talent management encompasses multiple complex processes that together play a vital role in helping organizations attract  develop  motivate  compensate and retain human capital to more effectively achieve business objectives 
most organizations no longer view human capital as an expense to be minimized  but instead as an asset to be developed and optimized 
modern  innovative organizations now recognize that much of their value resides in human capital 
this shift in thinking has mirrored the evolution of talent management from discrete  manual  paper based processes to a technology enabled  strategic initiative that integrates multiple processes 
at the same time as this shift in thinking  demographic trends in certain working populations and the increasing rate of voluntary and involuntary job turn over  what we refer to as job velocity  have made the ability to manage talent wisely a pressing need in organizations today 
to increase their return on investment in human capital  organizations now understand the need to systematically focus on measures such as quality of hire  time to productivity  internal employee mobility  employee retention  employee engagement  employee contribution and pay for performance 
systematically pursuing these goals requires the comprehensive  unified view of talent management that our solution provides 
software as a service delivery model our software as a service  delivery model enables our proprietary software solutions to be implemented  accessed and used by our customers remotely through an internet connection  a standard web browser and a variety of other access points such as smart phones  hand held devices  and productivity tools  like microsoft outlook 
our solutions are hosted and maintained by us  thus eliminating for our customers the time  risk  headcount and costs associated with installing and maintaining applications within their own information technology infrastructures 
as a result  we believe our solutions require less initial investment in third party software  hardware and implementation services  and have lower ongoing support costs than traditional enterprise software 
the saas model also allows advanced information technology infrastructure management  security  disaster recovery and other best practices to be leveraged by smaller customers that might not otherwise be able to implement such practices in their own information technology environments 
our saas delivery model also enables us to take advantage of operational efficiencies 
since updates and upgrades to our solutions are managed by us on behalf of our customers  we are able to implement improvements to our solutions in a more rapid and uniform way 
as a result  we are required to support fewer old versions of our solutions 
this allows our development resources to focus more effort on innovative new products 
we believe our saas delivery model  coupled with our subscription based license model  effectively replaces the large  front loaded cost  typical of most traditional licensed enterprise software deployments  with a lower risk  pay as you go model 
we believe the saas model is well suited to the talent management market in which we operate

risk factors risk factors because of the following factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results and financial condition  past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance  and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of  or that we currently deem immaterial  also may become important factors that affect us 
if any of the following risks occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operation could be materially and adversely affected 
in that case  the trading price of our stock could decline  and you may lose some or all of your investment 
we have a history of losses  and we cannot be certain that we will sustain profitability 
with the exception of the years ended december   and  we have incurred annual losses in every year since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million  comprised of aggregate net losses of million and million of dividends and issuance costs for preferred stock 
in the three months and year ended december   we reported a net loss of million and a net income of million  respectively 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
as we continue to incur costs associated with initiatives to grow our business  which may include  among other things  acquisitions  international expansion  significant hiring  and new product development  any failure to increase revenue or manage our cost structure could prevent us from achieving or sustaining profitability 
for instance  in the year ended december   our results were negatively impacted by amortization expense associated with acquisitions 
in the near term  we expect to continue to incur significant amortization expense associated with our past acquisitions 
in addition  we may incur losses as a result of revenue shortfalls or increased expenses associated with our business 
as a result  our business could be harmed and our stock price could decline 
unfavorable economic conditions could limit our ability to grow our business or result in less favorable commercial terms in our customer agreements 
our operating results may vary based on the impact of changes in economic conditions globally and within the industries in which our customers operate 
the revenue growth and profitability of our business depends on the overall demand for enterprise application software and services 
our revenue is derived from organizations whose businesses may fluctuate with global economic and business conditions 
historically  economic downturns have resulted in overall reductions in corporate information technology spending 
accordingly  any downturn in global economic conditions may weaken demand for our software and services generally  or an economic decline impacting a particular industry may negatively impact demand for our software and services in the affected industry 
many of the industries we serve  including financial services  manufacturing including automobile manufacturing  technology and retail  have recently suffered a downturn in economic and business conditions and may continue to do so 
a softening of demand for enterprise application software and services  and in particular enterprise talent management solutions  caused by a weakening global economy or economic downturn in a particular sector would adversely affect our business and likely cause a decline in our revenue 
unfavorable economic conditions may also cause increased delays in our sales cycles and increased pressure from prospective customers to offer higher discounts or less favorable payment  billing or other commercial terms than our historical practices  and may also cause increased pressure from existing customers to renew expiring software subscriptions agreements at lower rates  delay or cancel consulting or education services engagements  purchase fewer products upon renewal  or demand other less favorable commercial terms 
in addition  certain of our customers may attempt to negotiate lower software subscription fees for existing arrangements because of downturns in their businesses 
if we accept certain requests for higher discounts  lower fees or less favorable commercial terms  our business may be adversely affected and our revenues may decline 

table of contents additionally  certain of our customers have become or may become bankrupt or insolvent as a result of an economic downturn  and we may lose all future revenue from such customers and payment of receivables may be lower or delayed as a result of bankruptcy proceedings 
acquisitions and investments present many risks  and we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for any such transactions  which would harm our business  operating results and overall financial condition 
we have made  continue to make and routinely evaluate acquisitions or investments in companies  products  services  and technologies to expand our product offerings  customer base and business 
for example  in  we completed our acquisition of vurv  in january  we completed our acquisition of wwc  and on october  we completed our acquisition of learn 
com 
we have limited experience in executing acquisitions and investments 
acquisitions and investments involve a number of risks  including the following being unable to achieve the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions  difficulty integrating the accounting systems  operations  and personnel of the acquired business  difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business  our ongoing business and management s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations  difficulties and additional expenses associated with integrating or incorporating the acquired technologies or products into our existing code base and hosting infrastructure  difficulties and additional expenses associated with supporting the legacy products and hosting infrastructure of the acquired business  problems arising from differences in applicable accounting standards or practices of the acquired business for instance  non us businesses may not prepare their financial statements in accordance with gaap or difficultly identifying and correcting deficiencies in the internal controls over financial reporting of the acquired business  problems arising from differences in the revenue  licensing for instance  an acquired business may offer perpetual licenses  support for instance  an acquired business may offer customer specific customizations of product code to certain customers or consulting model of the acquired business  customer confusion regarding the positioning of acquired technologies or products  difficulty maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies across locations  difficulty retaining the acquired business customers  difficulty converting the customers of the acquired business onto taleo s technology platform and contract terms  and problems or liabilities associated with product quality  data privacy  data security  regulatory compliance  technology and legal contingencies 
the consideration paid in connection with an investment or acquisition also affects our financial results 
if we should proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration includes cash  we could be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash to consummate any such acquisition 
to the extent that we issue shares of stock or other rights to purchase stock  existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease 
in addition  acquisitions may result in our incurring debt  material one time write offs  or purchase accounting adjustments and restructuring charges 
they may also result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets in our financial statements which may be subject to future impairment charges or ongoing amortization costs  thereby reducing future earnings 
in addition  from time to time  we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or investments that are not ultimately consummated 
such negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time  as well as incurring expenses that may impact operating results 

table of contents because we recognize software subscription revenue over the term of the agreements for our software subscriptions  a significant downturn in our business may not be reflected immediately in our operating results  which increases the difficulty of evaluating our future financial position 
we generally recognize revenue from software subscription agreements ratably over the terms of these agreements  which are typically three or more years for our taleo enterprise customers and one year for our taleo business edition customers 
as a result  a substantial majority of our software subscription revenue in each quarter is generated from software subscription agreements entered into during prior periods 
consequently  a decline in new software subscription agreements in any one quarter may not affect our results of operations in that quarter  but will reduce our revenue in future quarters 
additionally  the timing of renewals or non renewals of a software subscription agreement during any one quarter may affect our financial performance in that particular quarter or may not affect our financial performance until the next quarter 
for example  because we recognize application revenue ratably  the non renewal of a software subscription agreement late in a quarter will have very little impact on revenue for that quarter  but will reduce our revenue in future quarters 
accordingly  the effect of significant declines in sales and market acceptance of our solutions may not be reflected in our short term results of operations  which would make these reported results less indicative of our future financial results 
by contrast  a non renewal occurring early in a quarter may have a significant negative impact on revenue for that quarter and we may not be able to offset a decline in revenue due to such non renewals with revenue from new software subscription agreements entered into in the same quarter 
in addition  we may be unable to adjust our costs in response to reduced revenue 
because of the way we are required to recognize our consulting revenue under applicable accounting guidance  consulting revenue reported for a particular period may not be indicative of trends in our consulting business  which increases the difficulty of evaluating our future financial position 
during and prior years  when we sold software subscriptions and consulting services in a single arrangement sometimes referred to as a multi element arrangement  we recognized revenue from consulting services ratably over the term of the software subscription agreement  which is typically three or more years  rather than as the consulting services were delivered  which is typically during the first six to twelve months of a software subscription agreement 
accordingly  a significant portion of the revenue for consulting services performed in any quarterly reporting period prior to was deferred to future periods 
however  under accounting guidance which we adopted on january   substantially all of our revenue from consulting service arrangements entered into on or after january  is recognized as the consulting services are delivered 
in addition  if we materially modify a multi element arrangement entered into prior to  the revenue associated with consulting services delivered in prior periods that would have been recognized ratably under our pre policy  will be recognized in the period of the material modification 
the application of these revenue recognition methodologies will result in our consulting revenue for the foreseeable future including a mix of revenue from consulting services delivered during the reporting period and consulting services delivered in previous reporting periods  which may make our results more difficult to understand and less indicative of our current operational trends 
further  since we recognize expenses related to our consulting services in the period in which the expenses are incurred  the consulting margins we report in any quarterly reporting period may not be indicative of the actual gross margin on consulting services delivered during the reporting period 
if our existing customers do not renew their software subscriptions and buy additional solutions from us  or if our customers renew at lower fee levels  our business will suffer 
we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from renewal of software subscriptions and  to a lesser extent  service fees from our existing customers 
as a result  maintaining the renewal rate of our software subscriptions is critical to our future success 
factors that may affect the renewal rate for our solutions include the price  performance and functionality of our solutions  the availability  price  performance and functionality of competing products and services  
table of contents the effectiveness of our maintenance and support services  our ability to develop complementary products and services  the stability  performance and security of our hosting infrastructure and hosting services  and the business environment of our customers and  in particular  headcount reductions by our customers 
most of our taleo enterprise customers enter into software subscription agreements with duration of three years or more from the initial contract date 
most of our taleo business edition customers enter into annual software subscription agreements 
our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions for our solutions after the expiration of the initial term of their agreements 
in addition  our customers may negotiate terms less advantageous to us upon renewal  which may reduce our revenue from these customers 
factors that are not within our control may contribute to such fee reductions 
for instance  many companies reduced their total employee populations during the recent economic downturn 
as our software subscriptions are often based on the total number of employees for which our software applications may be used by a customer  a significant employee count reduction by a customer during the term of an agreement may result in a renewal that is based on a lower maximum employee limit for the use of our products and thus a lower renewal fee 
under certain circumstances  our customers may cancel their subscriptions for our solutions prior to the expiration of the term 
our future success also depends  in part  on our ability to sell new products and services to our existing customers 
if our customers terminate their agreements  fail to renew their agreements  renew their agreements upon less favorable terms or at lower fee levels  or fail to buy new products and services from us  our revenue may decline or our future revenue may be constrained 
if our efforts to attract new customers are not successful or we do not compete effectively with other companies offering talent management solutions  our revenue may not grow and could decline 
in order to grow our business  we must continually add new customers 
our ability to attract new customers will depend in large part on the success of our sales and marketing efforts and our ability to compete with other talent management solution providers 
many of our prospective customers have traditionally used other products and services for their talent management requirements or have developed internal solutions to address certain talent management requirements 
if our sales and marketing efforts are not successful  our prospective customers may not be familiar with us or our solutions or may not consider our solutions to be of sufficiently high value and quality and  as a result  we may not be considered in such prospective customers sale cycles 
additionally  in the past we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  intense competition from a number of companies 
our solutions compete with enterprise resource planning software from vendors such as oracle corporation and sap ag  and also with products and services from vendors such as adp  cezanne  cornerstone ondemand inc  halogen software inc  healthcare source  hrsmart  icims  jobpartners  jobvite  kenexa corporation  kronos  peopleclick authoria inc  plateau systems ltd  saba software  silkroad technology  stepstone solutions  successfactors inc  sumtotal systems inc  and workday  inc our competitors may announce new products  services or enhancements that better meet changing industry standards or the price or performance needs of customers 
increased competition may cause pricing pressure and loss of market share  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
certain of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  development  marketing  sales  service and other resources than we have 
some of these companies also have a larger installed base of customers  longer operating histories and greater brand recognition than we have 
certain of our competitors provide products that incorporate capabilities which are not available in our current suite of solutions  such as automated payroll and benefits  or services that we do not currently offer  such as recruitment process outsourcing services 
products with such additional functionalities may be appealing to some customers because they can reduce the number of different types of software or applications used to run their business and 
table of contents such additional services may be viewed by some customers as enhancing the effectiveness of a competitor s solutions 
in addition  our competitors products may be more effective than our products at performing particular talent management functions or may be more customized for particular customer needs in a given market 
further  our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to changes in customer requirements 
our customers often require our products to be integrated with software provided by our existing or potential competitors 
these competitors could alter their products in ways that inhibit integration with our products  or they could deny or delay access by us to advance software releases  which would restrict our ability to adapt our products to facilitate integration with these new releases and could result in lost sales opportunities 
we have had to restate our historical financial statements and have identified internal control weaknesses 
in october  we announced that  after upgrading to a new version of the equity program administration software that we license from a third party provider  we identified differences in the stock based compensation expense of prior periods and  after reviewing such differences  identified an error in our accounting for stock based compensation expense 
as a result of identifying the error  in october  we concluded that accounting adjustments were necessary to correct certain previously issued financial statements 
accordingly  we restated those financial statements and recorded total cumulative additional stock based compensation expense of approximately million for the fiscal years ended december   and and the quarters ended june  and march  specifically  we recorded increases in stock based compensation expense of approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in the quarter ended june   and recorded reductions in stock based compensation expense of approximately million in fiscal and million in the quarter ended march  in connection with this restatement  we determined that there was a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of december   march   june  and september  specifically  our controls to calculate stock based compensation expense related to the application of the forfeiture rate were not designed effectively  and a material weakness existed in the design of the controls over the calculation of stock based compensation expense related to the application of the forfeiture rate as of those periods 
in addition  in march  we announced that we had completed a review of our revenue recognition practices and  as a result of this review  we restated certain financial statements in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  the restatement resulted in the deferral to future periods of million of consulting services revenue and approximately million in application revenue previously recognized through june  amounts in our previously issued consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  through  and the interim consolidated financial statements for each of the periods ended march  and june   have been corrected for the timing of revenue recognition for consulting services revenue during these periods  as well as to correct an error relating to the timing of revenue recognition for set up fees  an element of our application services revenue 
in connection with such review we identified certain control deficiencies relating to the application of applicable accounting literature related to revenue recognition 
these deficiencies constituted a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of september   which led to items requiring correction in our historical financial statements and our conclusion to restate such financial statements to correct those items 
specifically  the control deficiencies related to our failure to correctly interpret the multi element accounting guidance in determining the proper accounting treatment when application and consulting services are sold together 
we cannot be certain that the measures we have taken since these restatements will ensure that restatements will not occur in the future 
execution of restatements like the ones described above could create a significant strain on our internal resources and cause delays in our filing of quarterly or annual financial results  increase our costs and cause management distraction 
as part of our ongoing processes  we continue to focus on improvements in our internal control over financial reporting 
we have discussed deficiencies in our financial reporting and our remediation of such 
table of contents deficiencies with the audit committee of our board of directors and will continue to do so as required 
however  we cannot be certain that we will be able to detect  prevent or remediate all deficiencies which may exist now or in the future  including deficiencies which may constitute a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting 
any such current or future deficiencies could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information 
our financial performance may be difficult to forecast as a result of our historical focus on large customers and the long sales cycle associated with our solutions 
the majority of our revenue is currently derived from organizations with complex talent management requirements 
accordingly  in a particular quarter the majority of our bookings from new customers on an aggregate contract value basis are from large sales made to a relatively small number of customers 
as such  our failure to close a sale in a particular quarter will impede desired revenue growth unless and until the sale closes 
in addition  sales cycles for our taleo enterprise clients are generally between three months and one year  and in some cases can be longer 
as a result  substantial time and cost may be spent attempting to secure a sale that may not be successful 
the period between our first sales call on a prospective customer and a contract signing is relatively long due to several factors such as the complex nature of our solutions  the need to educate potential customers about the uses and benefits of our solutions  the relatively long duration of our contracts  the discretionary nature of our customers purchases  the timing of our customers budget cycles  the competitive evaluation of our solutions  fluctuations in the staffing management requirements of our prospective customers  announcements or planned introductions of new products by us or our competitors  and the lengthy purchasing approval processes of our prospective customers 
if our sales cycles unexpectedly lengthen  our ability to forecast accurately the timing of sales in any given period will be adversely affected and we may not meet our forecasts for that period 
if we fail to develop or acquire new products or enhance our existing products to meet the needs of our existing and future customers  our sales will decline 
to keep pace with technological developments  satisfy increasingly sophisticated customer requirements  and achieve market acceptance  we must enhance and improve existing products and continue to introduce new products and services 
for instance  the taleo talent grid  a foundation for sharing industry knowledge  technology and candidates  became generally available to our customers in september  and taleo  the newest version of our talent management solutions  became generally available to our customers in february additionally  on january   we completed our acquisition of wwc  which allows us to offer a compensation management solution directly to our customers  and on october   we completed our acquisition of learn 
com  which allows us to offer a learning management solution directly to our customers 
any new products we develop or acquire may not be introduced in a timely manner  may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue  and may generate additional development or integration expenses and resulting losses 
if we are unable to develop or acquire new products that appeal to our target customer base or enhance our existing products or if we fail to price our products to meet market demand or if the products we develop or acquire do not meet performance expectations or have a higher than expected cost structure to host and maintain  our business and operating results will be adversely affected 
additionally  our efforts to expand our solutions beyond our current offerings or beyond the talent management market may divert management resources from existing operations and require us to commit significant financial resources to an unprofitable business  which may harm our existing business 

table of contents if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to customer data or personal information  customers may curtail or stop their use of our solutions  which would harm our reputation  operating results  and financial condition 
our solutions involve the storage and transmission of customers proprietary information and users personal information  including the personal information of our customers job candidates 
as part of our solution  we may also offer third party proprietary solutions which require us to transmit our customers proprietary data and the personal information of job candidates to such third parties 
security breaches could expose us to loss of this information  and we could be required to undertake an investigation  notify affected data subjects and appropriate legal authorities and regulatory agencies  and conduct remediation efforts  which could include modifications to our current security practices and ongoing monitoring for users whose data might have been subject to unauthorized access 
accordingly  security breaches may result in investigation  remediation and notification expenses  litigation  liability  and financial penalties 
while we have administrative  technical  and physical security measures in place  and we contractually require third parties to whom we transfer data to have appropriate security measures  if any of these security measures are breached as a result of third party action  employee error  criminal acts by an employee  malfeasance  or otherwise  and  as a result  someone obtains unauthorized access to customer data or personal information  our reputation will be damaged  our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability 
techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target 
as a result  we and our partners to whom we transfer data may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 
applicable law may require that a security breach involving certain types of data be disclosed to each data subject or publicly disclosed 
if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs  the market perception of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and customers 
our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to failures in our security measures 
defects or errors in our products could affect our reputation  result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to sell our products  which would harm our business 
our products may contain defects or errors  which could materially and adversely affect our reputation  result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to sell our products in the future 
the costs incurred in correcting any product defects or errors may be substantial and could adversely affect our operating results 
while we test our products for defects or errors prior to product release  defects or errors have been identified from time to time by our customers and may continue to be identified in the future 
any defects that cause interruptions in the availability or functionality of our solutions could result in lost or delayed market acceptance and sales of our products  loss of customers  product liability and breach of warranty claims against us  diversion of development and support resources  injury to our reputation  increased billing disputes and customer claims for fee credits  and failure to meet our contractual service level commitments and associated contractual liabilities 
while our software subscription agreements typically contain limitations and disclaimers that should limit our liability for damages related to defects in our software  such limitations and disclaimers may not be upheld by a court or other tribunal or otherwise protect us from such claims 

table of contents if we fail to manage our datacenter operations satisfactorily  our existing customers may experience service outages and data loss  and our new customers may experience delays in the deployment of our solution 
our hosting infrastructure is a critical part of our business operations 
our customers access our solutions through a standard web browser via the internet and depend on us to enable fast and reliable access to our applications 
we have experienced  and may in the future experience  disruptions within our hosting infrastructure  some of which have been significant  which have prevented customers from using our solutions from time to time 
factors that may cause such disruptions include software errors or defects  equipment failures or defects  human error  physical or electronic security breaches  telecommunications outages from third party providers  computer viruses or other malicious code  acts of terrorism or sabotage  fire  earthquake  flood and other natural disasters  and power loss 
although we back up customer data stored on our systems at least daily our infrastructure does not currently include real time  or near real time  mirroring of data storage and production capacity in more than one geographically distinct location 
thus  in the event of a physical disaster  or certain other failures of our computing infrastructure  customer data from recent transactions may be permanently lost 
we have also experienced significant growth in the number of users  transactions  and data that our hosting infrastructure supports 
failure to address the increasing demands on our hosting infrastructure satisfactorily may result in service outages  delays or disruptions 
we seek to maintain sufficient excess capacity in our hosting infrastructure to meet the needs of all of our customers 
we also maintain excess capacity to facilitate the rapid provisioning of new customer deployments and expansion of existing customer deployments 
the development of new hosting infrastructure to keep pace with expanding storage and processing requirements could be a significant cost to us that we are not able to predict accurately and for which we are not able to budget significantly in advance 
such outlays could raise our cost of goods sold and be detrimental to our financial results 
at the same time  the development of new hosting infrastructure requires significant lead time 
if we do not accurately predict our infrastructure capacity requirements  our existing customers may experience service outages that may subject us to financial penalties  financial liabilities and the loss of customers 
if our hosting infrastructure capacity fails to keep pace with sales  customers may experience delays as we seek to obtain additional capacity  which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our revenue growth 
we currently deliver our taleo enterprise solutions from datacenters in which we have purchased cage space  electrical power and internet bandwidth 
we currently deliver our taleo business edition solutions from datacenters operated via managed services arrangements through which the datacenter provider provides electrical power  hardware  and internet bandwidth 
we deliver our talent grid solutions via similar managed services arrangements with third parties 
we do not control the operation of any of the datacenter facilities mentioned above and must rely on our vendors to provide the physical security  facilities management and communications infrastructure services to ensure the reliable and consistent delivery of our solutions to our customers 
although we believe we would be able to enter into a similar relationship with another third party should one of these relationships fail or terminate for any reason  we believe our reliance on any third party vendor exposes us to risks outside of our control 
if these third party vendors encounter financial difficulty such 
table of contents as bankruptcy or other events beyond our control that cause them to fail to secure adequately and maintain their hosting facilities or provide the required data communications capacity  our customers may experience interruptions in our service or the loss or theft of important customer data 
we may in the future consolidate certain of our data centers with our other existing data centers  or move certain data center operations to new facilities 
for example  we recently consolidated our us production data center operations for our taleo enterprise solution into a new facility in the chicago  illinois area 
when we consolidated these data center operations  we relocated existing hardware  purchased new hardware  and migrated all of our taleo enterprise customers proprietary information and their users personal information 
although we take reasonable precautions designed to mitigate the risks of such a move  such transitions create increased risk of service disruptions  outages and the theft or loss of important customer and user data that could harm our reputation  subject us to financial liability  and adversely affect our revenue and earnings 
we may also elect to open computing and communications hardware operations at additional third party facilities located in the united states  europe or other regions 
we are not experienced at operating such facilities in jurisdictions outside the united states and doing so may pose additional risk to us 
if  as a result of our datacenter operations  our customers experience service interruptions or the loss or theft of their data caused by us  we may be required to issue credits pursuant to the terms of our contracts and may also be subject to financial liability or customer losses 
such credits could reduce our revenues below the levels that we have indicated we expect to achieve and adversely affect our margins and operating results 
our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to any failures or interruptions in our systems 
the consolidation or acquisition of our competitors or other similar strategic alliances or changes in product offerings could weaken our competitive position or reduce our revenue 
there has been vendor consolidation in the market in which we operate and we believe such consolidation is likely to continue 
there may also be consolidation by one or more vendors with respect to the product sets currently offered by distinct talent management and human resource software vendors 
additional consolidation within our industry may change the competitive landscape in ways that adversely affect our ability to compete effectively 
our competitors may also establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future bpo partners  hro partners  systems integrators  third party consulting firms or other parties with whom we have relationships  thereby limiting our ability to promote our products and limiting the number of consultants available to implement our solutions 
disruptions in our business caused by these events could reduce our revenue 
we must hire and retain key employees and recruit qualified personnel or our future success and business could be harmed 
our success depends on the continued employment of our senior management and other key employees  such as our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer  and on our ability to attract and hire qualified senior management and executives 
if we lose the services of one or more of our senior management or key employees  or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise to compete with us  our business could be harmed 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our executive officers 
additionally  our continued success depends  in part  on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the software design and development  sales  and other functions of the business 
in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate the talent pool for such qualified personnel may be limited and we may find it difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel 
for instance  a significant portion of our software development function is 
table of contents conducted in quebec city  a relatively limited labor market 
additionally  we may find it difficult or more costly to attract and retain qualified personnel in alternative jurisdictions in which the talent pool is less limited  or the personnel we hire in such jurisdictions may be less effective than we expect 
it may also be particularly challenging to retain employees as we integrate newly acquired entities due to uncertainty among employees regarding their career options and cultural differences between us and the newly acquired entities 
we may lose sales opportunities if we do not successfully develop and maintain strategic relationships to sell and deliver our solutions 
we have partnered with a number of bpo and hro providers that resell our solutions as a component of their outsourced human resource services and we intend to partner with more bpos and hros in the future 
if customers or potential customers begin to outsource their talent management functions to bpos or hros that do not resell our solutions  or to bpos or hros that choose to develop their own solutions  our business will be harmed 
in addition  we have relationships with third party consulting firms  system integrators and software and service vendors who provide us with customer referrals  integrate their complementary products with ours  cooperate with us in marketing our products and provide our customers with system implementation or other consulting services 
if we fail to establish new strategic relationships or expand our existing relationships  or should any of these partners fail to work effectively with us or go out of business  our ability to sell our products into new markets and to increase our penetration into existing markets may be impaired 
a portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities  which are subject to a number of challenges and risks 
sales to us and foreign federal  state and local governmental agency end customers have accounted for a small portion of our revenue  and we may in the future increase sales to government entities 
sales into government entities are subject to a number of risks 
selling to government entities can be highly competitive  expensive and time consuming  often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that we will successfully sell our products and services to such governmental entity 
government entities may require contract terms that differ from our standard arrangements 
in addition  government demand and payment for our products may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations  with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our products 
some of our sales to government entities have been made indirectly through third party prime contractors that resell our solutions 
government entities may have contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our resellers for convenience or due to a default  and any such termination may adversely impact our future results of operations 
additionally  governments routinely audit and investigate government contractors  and we may be subject to such audits and investigations 
for example  we have been subject to government contract audits in the past and we are currently responding to subpoenas from the department of homeland security s inspector general s office relating to our commercial pricing for the transportation security administration  a government entity that accessed our services through a third party prime contractor 
as a result of an audit or investigation  we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeiture or refund of profits or certain fees collected  suspension of payments  fines  and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the government entity 
in addition  we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety are made against us 
if we are required to reduce our prices to compete successfully  our margins and operating results could be adversely affected 
the intensely competitive market in which we do business may require us to reduce our prices 
if our competitors offer discounts on certain products or services  we may be required to lower prices or offer our solutions on less favorable terms to compete successfully 
some of our larger competitors have significantly greater resources than we have and are better able to absorb short term losses 
any such changes would likely 
table of contents reduce our margins and could adversely affect our operating results 
some of our competitors may provide bundled product offerings that compete with ours for promotional purposes or as a long term pricing strategy 
these practices could  over time  limit the prices that we can charge for our products or services 
if we cannot offset price reductions with a corresponding increase in the quantity of applications sold  our margins and operating results would be adversely affected 
we currently derive a significant portion of our revenue from international operations and expect to expand our international operations 
however  we do not have substantial experience in international markets  and may not achieve the expected results 
during the year ended december   application revenue generated outside of the united states was of total application revenue  based on the location of the legal entity of the customer with which we contracted 
of the application revenue generated outside the united states  was generated in canada 
we conduct research and development in quebec  canada as well as other international locations 
we currently have international offices outside of north america in australia  france  the netherlands  and the united kingdom  which focus primarily on selling and implementing our solutions in those regions 
in the future  we may expand to other international locations 
our current international operations and future initiatives will involve a variety of risks  including potentially degrading general economic conditions and credit environments in europe and elsewhere  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  taxes  trade laws  tariffs  export quotas  custom duties or other trade restrictions  differing regulations in quebec  canada with regard to maintaining operations  products and public information in both french and english  differing labor and employment regulations  especially in the european union and quebec  canada where labor laws are generally more advantageous to employees as compared to the united states  including deemed hourly wage and overtime regulations in these locations and employee termination restrictions or related costs  more stringent regulations relating to data privacy and the unauthorized use of  or access to  commercial and personal information  particularly in europe and canada  reluctance to allow personally identifiable data related to non us citizens to be stored in databases within the united states  due to concerns over the united states government s right to access personally identifiable data of non us citizens stored in databases within the united states or other concerns  greater difficulty in supporting and localizing our products  greater difficulty in localizing our marketing materials and legal agreements  including translations of these materials into local language  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  challenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees or independent contractors over large geographic distances  including the need to implement appropriate systems  policies  benefits and compliance programs  limited or unfavorable intellectual property protection  and restrictions on repatriation of earnings 
if we invest substantial time and resources to expand our international operations and are unable to do so successfully and in a timely manner  our business and operating results will suffer 

table of contents fluctuations in the exchange rate of foreign currencies could result in currency transaction losses  which could harm our operating results and financial condition 
we currently have foreign sales denominated in foreign currencies  including the australian dollar  british pound sterling  canadian dollar and the euro  and may in the future have sales denominated in the currencies of additional countries 
we also incur a substantial portion of our operating expenses in canadian dollars and  to a much lesser extent  other foreign currencies 
any fluctuation in the exchange rate of these foreign currencies may positively or negatively affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
for instance  in  the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the average rates in effect during was a million gain 
in  the volatility in exchange rates for foreign currencies has continued and may continue and  as a result  we may continue to see fluctuations in our revenue and expenses  which may impact our operating results 
we have not previously engaged in foreign currency hedging 
if we decide to hedge our foreign currency exposure  we may not be able to hedge effectively due to lack of experience  unreasonable costs or illiquid markets 
if we fail to defend our proprietary rights aggressively  our competitive advantage could be impaired and we may lose valuable assets  experience reduced revenue  and incur costly litigation fees to protect our rights 
our success is dependent  in part  upon protecting our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of copyrights  trademarks  service marks  trade secret laws  and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products and services 
we do not significantly rely on patent registrations to protect our intellectual property 
we will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property 
despite our precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our products and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours 
some license provisions protecting against unauthorized use  copying  transfer and disclosure of our licensed products may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries in which we operate 
further  the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
to the extent we expand our international activities  our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our products and proprietary information may increase 
we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and enter into confidentiality agreements with the parties with whom we have strategic relationships and business alliances 
no assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our products and proprietary information 
further  these agreements do not prevent our competitors from developing technologies independently that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products 
initiating legal action has been and may continue to be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights 
litigation  whether successful or unsuccessful  could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources  either of which could seriously harm our business 
current and future litigation against us could be costly and time consuming to defend 
we are sometimes subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the course of business 
for example  we are currently defendant in a suit alleging patent infringement which is described in more detail in note of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements 
litigation may result in substantial costs  including lengthened or discontinued sales cycles due to concerns of existing or prospective customers with respect to litigation  and may divert management s attention and resources  which may seriously harm our business  overall financial condition  and operating results 
in addition  legal claims that have not yet been asserted against us may be asserted in the future 
see note of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements  for further information regarding pending and threatened litigation and potential claims 

table of contents our results of operations may be adversely affected if we are subject to a protracted infringement claim or a claim that results in a significant award for damages 
software product developers such as us may continue to receive infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our space grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
for example  kenexa  a competitor  filed suit against us for patent infringement in august additionally  in the first half of  we became aware that taleo customers had been contacted by an intellectual property licensing firm asserting that a usability feature of the taleo software was subject to patents held by the intellectual property licensing firm  and we are in discussions with the patent holder with respect to these assertions 
other infringement claims have been threatened against us 
we can give no assurance that such claims will not be filed in the future 
our competitors or other third parties may also challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property rights 
a claim may also be made relating to technology that we acquire or license from third parties 
if we were subject to a claim of infringement  regardless of the merit of the claim or our defenses  the claim could require costly litigation to resolve and the payment of substantial damages  require significant management time  cause us to enter into unfavorable royalty or license agreements  require us to discontinue the sale of our products  damage our relationship with existing or prospective customers and disrupt our sales cycles  require us to indemnify our customers or third party service providers  or require us to expend additional development resources to redesign our products 
we entered into standard indemnification agreements in the ordinary course of business and may be required to indemnify our customers for our own products and third party products that are incorporated into our products and that infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
although many of the third parties from which we purchase are obligated to indemnify us if their products infringe the rights of others  this indemnification may not be adequate 
our insurance policies will not compensate us for any losses or liabilities resulting from patent infringement claims 
we use open source software in our products  which could subject us to litigation or other actions 
we use open source software in our products and may use more open source software in the future 
from time to time  there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products 
as a result  we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software 
litigation could be costly for us to defend  have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our products 
in addition  if we were to combine our proprietary software products with open source software in a certain manner  we could  under certain of the open source licenses  be required to release the source code of our proprietary software products 
if we inappropriately use open source software  we may be required to re engineer our products  discontinue the sale of our products or take other remedial actions 
we employ technology licensed from third parties for use in or with our solutions  and the loss or inability to maintain these licenses or errors in the software we license could result in increased costs  or reduced service levels  which would adversely affect our business 
our hosted solutions incorporate certain technology obtained under licenses from other companies  such as oracle for database software 
we anticipate that we will continue to license technology and development tools 
table of contents from third parties in the future 
although we believe that there are commercially reasonable software alternatives to the third party software we currently license  this may not always be the case  or we may license third party software that is more difficult or costly to replace than the third party software we currently license 
in addition  integration of our products with new third party software may require significant work and require substantial allocation of our time and resources 
also  to the extent that our products depend upon the successful operation of third party products in conjunction with our products  any undetected errors in these third party products could prevent the implementation or impair the functionality of our products  delay new product introductions and injure our reputation 
our use of additional or alternative third party software would require us to enter into license agreements with third parties  which could result in higher costs 
difficulties that we may encounter in managing changes in the size of our business could affect our operating results adversely 
in order to manage our business effectively  we must continually manage headcount in an efficient manner 
in the past  we have undergone facilities consolidations and headcount reductions in certain locations and departments 
as a result  we have incurred  and may incur  charges for employee severance 
we may experience additional facilities consolidations and headcount reductions in the future 
as many employees are located in jurisdictions outside of the united states  we are required to pay the severance amounts legally required in such jurisdictions  which may exceed those of the united states 
further  we believe reductions in our workforce and facility consolidation create anxiety and uncertainty  and may adversely affect employee morale 
these measures could adversely affect our employees that we wish to retain and may also adversely affect our ability to hire new personnel 
they may also negatively affect customers 
failure to manage our customer deployments effectively could increase our expenses and cause customer dissatisfaction 
enterprise deployments of our products require a substantial understanding of our customers businesses  and the resulting configuration of our solutions to their business processes and integration with their existing systems 
we may encounter difficulties in managing the timeliness of these deployments and the allocation of personnel and resources by us or our customers 
in certain situations  we also work with third party service providers in the implementation or software integration related services of our solutions  and we may experience difficulties in managing such third parties 
failure to manage customer implementation or software integration related services successfully by us or our third party service providers could harm our reputation and cause us to lose existing customers  face potential customer disputes or limit the rate at which new customers purchase our solutions 
our ability to conclude that a control deficiency is not a material weakness or that an accounting error does not require a restatement can be affected by a number of factors  including our level of pre tax income 
under the sarbanes oxley act of  our management is required to assess the impact of control deficiencies based upon both quantitative and qualitative factors  and depending upon that analysis we classify such identified deficiencies as either a control deficiency  significant deficiency or a material weakness 
one element of our analysis of the significance of any control deficiency is its actual or potential financial impact 
this assessment will vary depending on our level of pre tax income or loss 
for example  a smaller pre tax income or loss will increase the likelihood of a quantitative assessment of a control deficiency as a significant deficiency or material weakness 
because our pre tax income loss is relatively small  if management or our independent registered public accounting firm identify an error in our interim or annual financial statements  it is more likely that such an error 
table of contents may be determined to be a material weakness or may meet the quantitative threshold established under staff accounting bulletin no 
 materiality  that could  depending upon the complete quantitative and qualitative analysis  result in our having to restate previously issued financial statements 
our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in generally accepted accounting principles or changes in our operating history that impact the application of generally accepted accounting principles 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  are subject to interpretation by the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  the sec  the american institute of certified public accountants  or aicpa  the public company accounting oversight board and various other organizations formed to promulgate and interpret accounting principles 
a change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our historical or future financial results 
the application of gaap to our operations may also require significant judgment and interpretation as to the appropriate treatment of a specific issue 
these judgments and interpretations are complicated by the relative newness of the on demand  vendor hosted software business model  also called software as a service  or saas  and the relative lack of interpretive guidance with respect to the application of gaap to the saas model 
for example in october  the fasb issued accounting guidance related to the recognition of multiple element arrangements  which superseded the guidance used during the new guidance  which we adopted as of january   will generally require us to recognize the majority of consulting services revenue from multiple element arrangements as the consulting services are delivered for arrangements we have entered into after january  we cannot ensure that our interpretations and judgments with respect to the application of gaap will be correct in the future and any incorrect interpretations and judgments could adversely affect our business 
if benefits currently available under the tax laws of canada  the province of quebec and other jurisdictions are reduced or repealed  or if we have taken an incorrect position with respect to tax matters under discussion with the canadian revenue agency or other domestic or foreign taxing authorities  our business could suffer 
the majority of our research and development activities are conducted through our canadian subsidiary  taleo canada inc we participate in a provincial government program in quebec that provides refundable investment tax credits based upon qualifying research and development expenditures 
these expenditures primarily consist of the salaries for the persons conducting research and development activities 
we have participated in the program since  and expect that we will continue to receive these refundable investment tax credits through december in and  we recorded  respectively  a million and million reduction in our research and development expenses as a result of this program 
this particular refundable investment tax credit program in quebec has been eliminated for and beyond 
we have applied for an alternative provincial investment tax credit program that will replace the expiring december quebec program and our application is under review by the quebec revenue authorities 
it is uncertain whether we will qualify under this new program  and if we do qualify  the total amount of refundable tax credits we will receive is uncertain 
if we are unsuccessful in qualifying for this alternative provincial tax credit program our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected 
in addition to the provincial research and development refundable investment tax credit program described above  our canadian subsidiary is participating in a scientific research and experimental development  or sred  program administered by the canadian federal government that provides income tax credits based upon qualifying research and development expenditures 
for tax years and  we recorded an estimated sred credit claim of approximately million and million respectively 
our canadian subsidiary is eligible to remain in the sred program for future tax years as long as its development projects continue to qualify 
these canadian federal sred tax credits can only be applied to offset canadian federal taxes payable 
table of contents and are reported as a credit to our tax provision to the extent they reduce taxes payable to zero with any residual benefits recorded as a net deferred tax asset 
we believe that our canadian subsidiary is in compliance with these government programs and that all amounts recorded will be fully realized 
if these sred investment tax credits are reduced or disallowed by the federal canada revenue agency cra  our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected 
in december  we were notified by the cra of their intention to audit tax years through to date  cra has issued assessment notices for tax years and seeking increases to taxable income of cad million and cad million  respectively 
in december of  we received a proposal letter from cra with regards to tax year  detailing their initial proposal of increasing taxable income of cad million 
these adjustments relate  principally  to our treatment of canadian development technology incentives cdti tax credits and income and expense allocations recorded between us and our canadian subsidiary 
we disagree with the cra s basis for these adjustments and have appealed their assessments through applicable administrative and judicial procedures 
there could be significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits over the next twelve months depending on the outcome of any tax audit 
we have recorded income tax reserves believed to be sufficient to cover any potential tax assessments for the open tax years 
in the event the cra audit results in adjustments that exceed our recorded tax reserves  we may have to accrue additional tax expense  and to the extent the cra audit results in adjustments that exceed both our tax reserves and our available deferred tax assets  we may be required to accrue and pay additional tax  penalties and interest  the amount of which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
we have sought us tax treaty relief through the appropriate competent authority tribunals for the and assessments received by the cra  and have indicated our intent to do so for when cra issues their final assessment 
although we believe we have reasonable basis for our tax positions  it is possible an adverse outcome could have a material effect upon our financial condition  operating results or cash flows in a particular quarter or annual period 
as we continue to expand domestically and internationally  we are increasingly subject to reviews by various us and foreign taxing authorities the outcomes of which could negatively impact our financial results 
while we have reserved for these uncertainties and do not expect the outcomes of these reviews to be material to our operations  our current assessment as to the potential financial impact of these reviews could prove incorrect and we may incur additional income tax expense in the period the uncertainty is resolved 
we are currently under review by the province of quebec regarding the application of the contribution to the fonds des services de sant fss  pursuant to the act respecting the r gie de l assurance maladie du qu bec with respect to the stock option benefits derived by taleo canada employees participating in the taleo corporation stock option plan 
we disagree with the conclusion that we are subject to the contribution requirements 
we have received proposed assessments that we continue to discuss and reconcile with representatives of the quebec government and have received a final assessment for we plan to formally object to this assessment and any future final assessments 
based upon a recent court ruling in quebec that was adverse to a taxpayer in a fact scenario similar to ours  we have recorded a reserve for a potential contribution liability 
we believe our reserve recorded is sufficient to cover any potential final assessments for the open years 
in the event the audit results in adjustments that exceed our recorded reserve  we may have to accrue additional liabilities which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or changes in the application of tax laws 
changes in applicable tax laws and regulations  and the related rulings  interpretations  and developments can affect our overall effective income tax rate 
for instance  we have historically applied existing and available net operating loss carryforward balances to reduce our income tax liabilities in various taxing jurisdictions 
in 
table of contents and  the state of california suspended the ability of corporations to apply net operating losses to reduce taxable income in these years 
in october  the state of california suspended the use of net operating losses for california income tax purposes for our tax years ended december  and december  in addition  illinois has suspended the use of net operating losses for illinois income tax purposes for our tax years ending december  through december  if additional states curtail the use of net operating losses  our tax expense may increase 
furthermore  as we expand our international operations  complete acquisitions  develop new products and new distribution models  implement changes to our operating structure or undertake intercompany transactions  changes in tax laws may result in an increase to our tax expense 
an adverse determination with respect to our application of tax laws may negatively impact our tax rates and financial results 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and in various foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes  and  in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable  the estimation process and interpretations of applicable laws are inherently uncertain  and our estimates are not binding on tax authorities 
the tax laws treatment of software and internet based transactions is particularly uncertain and in some cases currently applicable tax laws are ill suited to address these kinds of transactions 
for instance  the application of us state and local sales use tax laws to our business model is not uniform across all state taxing jurisdictions with some jurisdictions addressing the taxability of our revenue streams through statutes  regulations and public rulings  other jurisdictions taking positions through unpublished private rulings  while still others are silent 
we believe we have appropriately reserved for any potential uncollected sales use taxes  however  our interpretations are not binding on tax authorities and the outcome of any future audit is uncertain and could have a material impact on our operations 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many intercompany transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
although we believe we are in compliance with transfer pricing laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which we conduct business  there is no assurance that the final determination of any tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
the ultimate resolution of these issues may take extended periods of time due to examinations by tax authorities and statutes of limitations 
evolving regulation of the internet or changes in the infrastructure underlying the internet may adversely affect our financial condition by increasing our expenditures and causing customer dissatisfaction 
as internet commerce continues to evolve  increasing regulation by federal  state or foreign agencies may become more likely 
we are particularly sensitive to these risks because the internet is a critical component of our business model 
for example  we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy  and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation  collection  processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers ability to use and share data  potentially reducing demand for solutions accessed via the internet and restricting our ability to store  process and share data with our customers via the internet 
in addition  taxation of services provided over the internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the internet may also be imposed 
legislation has been proposed  from time to time  that may impact the way that internet service providers treat internet traffic 
the outcome of such proposals is uncertain but certain outcomes may negatively impact our business or increase our operating costs 
any regulation imposing greater fees for internet use or restricting information exchange over the internet could result in a decline in the use of the internet and the viability of internet based services  which could harm our business 
the rapid and continual growth of traffic on the internet has resulted at times in slow connection and download speeds among internet users 
our business expansion may be harmed if the internet infrastructure 
table of contents cannot handle our customers demands or if hosting capacity becomes insufficient 
if our customers become frustrated with the speed at which they can utilize our software over the internet  our customers may discontinue use of our products and choose not to renew their contract with us 
our stock price is likely to be volatile and could decline 
the stock market in general and the market for technology related stocks in particular have been highly volatile 
as a result  the market price of our stock is likely to be similarly volatile  and investors in our stock may experience a decrease in the value of their stock  including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 
the price of our stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors  including those listed in this risk factors section and others such as our operating performance and the performance of other similar companies  overall performance of the equity markets  developments with respect to intellectual property rights  publication of unfavorable research reports about us or our industry or withdrawal of research  coverage by securities analysts or lack of coverage by securities analysts  speculation in the press or investment community  general economic conditions and data and the impact of such conditions and data on the equity markets  terrorist acts  and announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  new technologies  acquisitions  commercial relationships  joint ventures or capital commitments 
we may need to raise additional capital  which may not be available  thereby adversely affecting our ability to operate our business 
if we need to raise additional funds due to unforeseen circumstances  we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  if at all  and any additional financings could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
if we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms  we may not be able to meet our business objectives  our stock price may fall and you may lose some or all of your investment 
if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business  our stock price and trading volume could decline 
the trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business 
if no or few securities or industry analysts cover our company  the trading price for our stock would be negatively impacted 
if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes misleading or unfavorable research about our business  our stock price would likely decline 
if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly  demand for our stock could decrease  which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law may delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could increase the difficulty for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
for example  if a potential acquirer were to make a hostile bid for us  the acquirer would not be able to call a special meeting of stockholders to remove our 
table of contents board of directors or act by written consent without a meeting 
in addition  our board of directors has staggered terms  which means that replacing a majority of our directors would require at least two annual meetings 
the acquirer would also be required to provide advance notice of its proposal to replace directors at any annual meeting  and will not be able to cumulate votes at a meeting  which will require the acquirer to hold more shares to gain representation on the board of directors than if cumulative voting were permitted 
our board of directors also has the ability to issue preferred stock that could significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer 
in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law limits business combination transactions with or greater stockholders that have not been approved by the board of directors 
these provisions and other similar provisions make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without negotiation 
these provisions may apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders

we have engaged in settlement discussions with kenexa  but no settlement agreement has been reached 
litigation is ongoing with respect to these matters  and both parties have filed summary judgment motions 
trial scheduled for the week of december   was postponed and rescheduled to begin on june  on june   we filed a reexamination request with the united states patent and trademark office uspto  seeking reconsideration of the validity of patent no 
 based on prior art that we presented with our reexamination request 
finding that our reexamination request raised a substantial new question of patentability  the uspto ordered reexamination of patent no 
 on september  on november   the uspto issued an office action rejecting all of the claims of patent no 
 because they are either anticipated by or unpatentable over the prior art 
after comments by both parties to the reexamination  on june  the uspto issued a subsequent action standing by its determination that certain claims of patent no 
 are unpatentable  but indicating patentability of other claims 
both parties have since provided additional comments on this subsequent action and both parties have since filed appeals to elements of the reexamination to the uspto s board of patent appeals and interferences 
the uspto board of patent appeals and interferences has set an oral hearing for april  accordingly  the uspto s reexamination of patent no

in a separate action filed on june  in the united states district court for the district of delaware  kenexa s parent  kenexa technology  inc kenexa technology  asserted claims against us for tortious interference with contract  unfair competition  unfair trade practices  and unjust enrichment arising from our refusal to allow kenexa technology employees to access and use our proprietary applications to provide outsourcing services to a customer 
kenexa technology seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief 
we answered kenexa technology s complaint on july  on october   we amended our answer and filed counterclaims against kenexa technology  alleging copyright infringement  misappropriation of trade secrets  interference with contractual relations  and unfair competition arising from kenexa technology s unauthorized access and use of our products in the course of providing outsourcing services to its customers

the matter is ongoing 

table of contents other matters in addition to the matters described above  we are subject to various claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business from time to time  including claims and legal proceedings that have been asserted against us by customers  former employees and advisors and competitors 
we are also subject to legal proceedings or discussions that may result in litigation  settlements or other liabilities in the future 
for instance we have received and are currently responding to a subpoenas from the department of homeland security s inspector general s office relating to our commercial pricing for the transportation security administration  a government entity that accessed our services through a third party prime contractor  and as a result of this inquiry  we may be subject to penalties  sanctions  or other damages  including forfeiture or refund of profits or certain fees collected  fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the involved government entity  in the first half of  we became aware that certain taleo customers had been contacted by an intellectual property licensing firm asserting that a usability feature of the taleo software was subject to patents held by the intellectual property licensing firm  and we are in discussions with the patent holder with respect to these assertions  we were recently notified of a potential collective and or class action claim under federal and state wage and hour laws with respect to a portion of our employee population  and we are in discussions with the potential claimants with respect to these assertions  and we were recently notified by a former customer that the former customer intends to seek indemnification from us with respect to costs arising from an alleged data privacy breach involving the vurv product that we acquired in taleo is currently awaiting more information about this potential claim from the former customer 
we accrue for estimated losses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for matters with respect to which we believe the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable
