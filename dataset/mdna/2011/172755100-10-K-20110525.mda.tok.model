table of contents overview we were incorporated in california in  became a public company in  and were reincorporated in the state of delaware in february initially  our focus was on providing ics for personal computer applications  including personal computer pc graphics and storage 
in  we refocused our business efforts away from these areas  which we believed had become commodity like in terms of pricing and offered diminished opportunities for sustained product differentiation and profitability 
we reinforced our commitment to operate efficiently and profitably by taking strategic actions beginning in to improve our top and bottom line growth  including improving efficiencies by focusing on our mixed signal audio and energy product lines  divesting our digital video product line assets and non core products to focus on our core strengths  and enhancing our capital structure by completing a million stock repurchase program in fiscal year to increase long term stockholder value 
we continued this process in fiscal years and by focusing on winning new designs  growing our market share in portable audio products in particular  completing another million stock repurchase program  announcing another million stock buyback  and by laying the foundation for growth in our energy products 
fiscal year in fiscal year we continued our strategy of targeting and developing relationships with tier customers in growing markets  such as portable audio products  including smartphones  automobile audio amplifiers  and energy measurement and energy control 
we build on our diverse analog and signal processing patent portfolio by delivering highly optimized products for a variety of audio and energy related applications 
while we dedicate substantial resources and investments towards portable audio products  we are also investing in energy related applications 
our current investments in the energy product lines are focused on energy measurement and the energy control areas such as power factor correction  motor control  and lighting 
we have received our first digital led lighting controller back from the fab  and have a tier customer currently evaluating the use of this device 
fiscal year net sales of million represented a percent increase over fiscal year net sales of million 
audio product line sales of million in fiscal year represented a percent increase over fiscal year sales of million  and were primarily attributable to higher sales of portable audio and surround codec products 
energy product line sales of million in fiscal year represented a percent increase over fiscal year sales of million  and were primarily attributable to higher seismic  power meter  and power amplification products 
overall gross margin of percent for fiscal year reflects an increase from fiscal year margin of percent due to enhanced supply chain management  activity within the energy product line  and in particular to the sales of seismic  power meter  and power amplification products 
with expanding design win opportunities in both our audio and energy product lines  the company continued to take advantage of the availability of engineering talent  which resulted in an increase of research and development employees  or percent  as compared to the end of fiscal year the company achieved net income of million in fiscal year  which included a benefit for income taxes in the amount of million as a result of the realization of an additional million of net deferred tax assets 
finally  the company s cash  cash equivalents and investments balances as of march   of million reflects an increase of million  or percent  over the ending balances from the prior fiscal year 
fiscal year fiscal year net sales of million represented a percent increase over fiscal year net sales of million 
increased sales from our audio product line  in particular portable audio and surround codec products  were key drivers in the overall improvement in top line revenues in fiscal year versus the prior fiscal year 
page of 
table of contents while fiscal year net sales from our energy product line reflected a net percent reduction from fiscal year results  the energy product line ended its fiscal year on a positive note with increased sales of seismic and power meter products  as well as improved performance from arm and communication products 
we saw improvements in a variety of our energy product lines throughout fiscal year  as our traditional industrial business benefitted from the improving economy 
seismic product sales were down from prior year peak levels  although they improved sequentially throughout fiscal year overall gross margin of percent for fiscal year reflected a decrease from fiscal year margin of percent due to the recent growth in sales of portable audio products  as well as a mix change to lower margin products in our energy product line driven primarily by a reduction in seismic product sales in fiscal year the company achieved net income of million in fiscal year  which included an million recognition of deferred tax assets 
the million of net income in fiscal year represented an increase of million over fiscal year net income of million 
finally  the company s cash  cash equivalents and investments balances as of march   of million reflects an increase of million over the ending balances from the prior fiscal year 
fiscal year for fiscal year  net sales were down approximately percent from the preceding year 
however  our strength in revenue from new products and prudent expense management were key drivers in the company maintaining bottom line profitability for the year as a whole while establishing a solid base for future growth

table of contents net sales we report sales in two product categories audio products and energy products 
our sales by product line are as follows in thousands march  march  march  audio products energy products total net sales for fiscal year increased percent  to million from million in fiscal year the increase in net sales reflects a million increase in audio product sales and a million increase in energy product sales 
the audio products group experienced growth primarily from the sales of portable and surround codecs products  while the energy product group sales increases were primarily attributable to sales of seismic  power meter  and power amplification products 
net sales for fiscal year increased percent  to million from million in fiscal year the increase in net sales reflects a million increase in audio product sales and a million decrease in energy product sales 
the audio products group experienced growth from the sales of portable and surround codecs products  which were partially offset by decreases in adc and interface product sales 
within the energy product group  sales decreases were primarily attributable to lower sales of seismic  communications  and arm processor based products 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in power meter products sales 
export sales  principally to asia  including sales to us based customers that manufacture products at plants overseas  were approximately million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year export sales to customers located in asia were percent  percent  and percent of net sales in fiscal years   and  respectively 
all other export sales represented percent  percent  and percent of net sales in fiscal years   and  respectively 
our sales are denominated primarily in us dollars 
during fiscal years   and  we did not enter into any foreign currency hedging contracts 
gross margin overall gross margin of percent for fiscal year reflects an increase from fiscal year margin of percent  primarily due to enhanced supply chain management  sales activity within the energy product line  and in particular to the sales of seismic  power meter  and power amplification products 
the sale of product written down in prior fiscal years contributed approximately million  or percent  to gross margin compared to approximately million  or percent  in fiscal year in total  excess and obsolete inventory charges  including scrapped inventory  increased by million from fiscal year and resulted in a decrease of gross margin by percent 
the million increase in excess and obsolete inventory charges was primarily attributable to a charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of the company s current fiscal year due to a production issue with a new audio device that entered high volume production in march gross margin was percent in fiscal year  down from percent in fiscal year the decrease in margin from fiscal year was mainly due to changes in both customer and product mix 
while the audio product group experienced a slight increase in margin from fiscal year to fiscal year and the energy group margins were essentially unchanged for this comparable period  the increase in the percentage of sales from the audio group in fiscal year caused a net reduction in overall margins 
the sale of product that had been written down in prior fiscal years contributed approximately million  or percent  to gross margin compared to a contribution of approximately million  or percent  in fiscal year in total  excess and obsolete inventory charges increased by million from fiscal year  which resulted in a decrease in gross margin by percent

table of contents research and development expenses fiscal year research and development expenses of million reflect an increase of million  or percent  from fiscal year the variance was primarily due to a percent increase in research and development headcount and associated employee expenses  including variable compensation attributable to improved operating profit 
additionally  employment expenses also increased primarily due to contract labor costs and employee hiring related expenses 
fiscal year research and development expenses of million reflect an increase of million  or percent  from fiscal year the increase was primarily due to million in salary and benefit costs associated with research and development personnel  whose headcount increased percent in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year additionally  product development expenses increased million  primarily due to higher photo mask expenses 
these increases in research and development expenses were partially offset by non recurring engineering work performed and billed to third parties  which resulted in a million reduction in research and development expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses of million reflect an increase of million  or percent  compared to fiscal year the million increase was primarily attributable to increased variable compensation costs driven by improved operating profit  as well as to higher stock option expenses and external sales representative commissions 
the number of employees in the selling  general  and administrative expense category remained essentially unchanged from the end of fiscal year fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses of million reflect an increase of million  or percent  compared to fiscal year as an increase in salaries and benefits costs was offset by decreased expenses across several expense categories 
a million increase in salaries and benefits costs was primarily attributable to increased headcount  and also due to higher sales commissions brought on by increased product sales and fluctuations in commissionable product mix in fiscal year versus fiscal year offsetting this increase was a million reduction in net rent expenses  a decrease in marketing expenses  and a million reduction in professional expenses 
restructuring costs and other  net during fiscal year  we recorded net restructuring charges of million as a separate line item on the statement of operations in operating expenses under the caption restructuring costs and other  net 
the restructuring charge was primarily due to revised sublease assumptions for lease space within our corporate headquarters building 
as of march   we have a remaining restructuring accrual for all of our past restructurings of million  primarily related to future lease payments net of anticipated subleases that will be paid over the respective lease terms through the summer of calendar year we have classified million of this restructuring accrual as long term 
impairment of proceeds from non marketable securities in the second quarter of the current fiscal year  the company recognized a loss on the impairment of an equity investment in the amount of million 
our original investment was in the form of a note receivable  which was then converted into an equity security during the second quarter of the current fiscal year 
after the conversion  we determined that an impairment indicator existed related to our cost method investment 
we performed a fair value analysis of our cost method investment in accordance with fasb asc topic investments debt and equity securities 
based on the results of this analysis as of september   we recognized an impairment of million to reduce the carrying value of the cost method investment to zero 
the impairment was recorded as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of operations in operating expenses under the caption impairment of proceeds from non marketable securities

the impairment was recorded as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of operations in operating expenses under the caption impairment of intangible assets 
interest income interest income in fiscal years   and  was million  million  and million respectively 
the decrease in interest income in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  as well as for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  was attributable to lower yields on invested capital 
income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of million in fiscal year on a pre tax income of million  yielding an effective tax benefit rate of percent 
our effective tax rate was lower than the us statutory rate of percent  primarily as a result of the release of a portion of the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets that have not yet been utilized 
the release of a portion of the valuation allowance generated a million tax benefit and was based on an evaluation of the net us deferred tax assets that we expect are more likely than not to be utilized in the upcoming years as a result of projected net income 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million in fiscal year on a pre tax income of million  yielding an effective tax benefit rate of percent 
our effective tax rate was lower than the us statutory rate of percent  primarily as a result of the realization of deferred tax assets that had been fully reserved and the release of a portion of the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets that have not yet been utilized

we recorded an income tax provision of million in fiscal year on a pre tax income of million  yielding an effective tax rate of percent 
our effective tax rate was higher than the us statutory rate of percent primarily due to a million charge to tax expense to increase the valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets 
we evaluate our ability to realize our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
we have deferred tax assets generated in non us jurisdictions that we have recognized since it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized 
outlook based on our strategic plan  our long term business model targets for the company are annual revenue growth of percent  gross margins of percent  and operating profit of percent 
in fiscal year  we anticipate revenue growth below this target in the first two quarters  with stronger revenue growth in the second half of the fiscal year when new product introductions from multiple customers begin shipping in full production

the cash restriction for this lease agreement is reduced to million in september and expires in may as of march  the company has no debt arrangements 
the company has commenced construction of our planned new headquarters facility in austin  texas with completion expected in the summer of calendar year we estimate that as of march  the remaining facility construction costs will be approximately million and will generally occur ratably throughout the construction process 
in addition  we estimate that we will incur an additional million in furniture  fixtures  and equipment in order to fully move our headquarters employees into this new facility 
it is anticipated that the project will be funded internally from existing and future cash flows 
although we cannot provide assurances to our stockholders that we will be able to generate cash in the future  we anticipate that our existing capital resources and cash flow generated from future operations will enable us to maintain our current level of operations for at least the next months

recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu  which amends the disclosure guidance with respect to fair value measurements 
specifically  the new guidance requires disclosure of amounts transferred in and out of levels and fair value measurements  a reconciliation presented on a gross basis rather than a net basis of activity in level fair value measurements  greater disaggregation of the assets and liabilities for which fair value measurements are presented and more robust disclosure of the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure level and fair value measurements 
asu was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   with the exception of the new guidance around the level activity reconciliations  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements included in this report  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts 
we evaluate the estimates on an on going basis 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgments and estimates that are used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for purposes of determining the variables used in the calculation of stock compensation expense for stock options under the provisions of fasb asc topic  equity and fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation  we perform an analysis of current market data and historical company data to calculate an estimate of implied volatility  the expected term of the option  and the expected forfeiture rate 
with the exception of the expected forfeiture rate  which is not an input  we page of 
table of contents use these estimates as variables in the black scholes option pricing model 
depending upon the number of stock options granted  any fluctuations in these calculations could have a material effect on the results presented in our consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  any differences between estimated forfeitures and actual forfeitures could also have a material impact on our financial statements 
we recognize revenue in accordance with asc topic  revenue recognition  when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery of goods has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we evaluate our distributor arrangements  on a distributor by distributor basis  with respect to each of the four criteria above 
for a majority of our distributor arrangements  we provide rights of price protection and stock rotation 
as a result  revenue is deferred at the time of shipment to our domestic distributors and certain international distributors due to the determination that the ultimate sales price to the distributor is not fixed or determinable 
once the distributor has resold the product  and our final sales price is fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue for the final sales price and record the related costs of sales 
for certain of our smaller international distributors  we do not grant price protection rights and provide minimal stock rotation rights 
for these distributors  revenue is recognized upon delivery to the distributor  less an allowance for estimated returns  as the revenue recognition criteria have been met upon shipment 
further  the company defers the associated cost of goods sold on our consolidated balance sheet  net within the deferred income on shipments to distributors current liability caption 
the company routinely evaluates the products held by our distributors for impairment to the extent such products may be returned by the distributor within these limited rights and such products would be considered excess or obsolete if included within our own inventory 
products returned by distributors and subsequently scrapped have historically been immaterial to the company 
we believe this treatment is in accordance with asc topic  inventory 
the company evaluates accounts receivable in accordance with fasb asc topic  receivables 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability or failure of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the age of the receivable  our ongoing customer relations  as well as any disputes with the customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  which could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
additionally  we may maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses on receivables from customers with whom we are involved in litigation 
see note accounts receivable  net of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item the company evaluates inventory in accordance with fasb asc topic  inventory 
inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
we write down inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted demand  management judgment  and the age of inventory 
actual demand and market conditions may be different from those projected by management  which could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
see note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item we evaluate the recoverability of property  plant  and equipment and intangible assets in accordance with fasb asc topic  property  plant  and equipment  and fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
we test for impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
an impairment loss is recognized in the event the carrying value of these assets exceeds the fair value of the applicable assets 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by management  which page of 
table of contents could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
see note intangibles  net of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item the company evaluates goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
goodwill is recorded at the time of an acquisition and is calculated as the difference between the total consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development ipr d 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment tests 
if the assumptions and estimates used to allocate the purchase price are not correct  or if business conditions change  purchase price adjustments or future asset impairment charges could be required 
the value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  could be impacted by future adverse changes such as i any future declines in our operating results  ii a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks  including the valuation of our common stock  iii a significant slowdown in the worldwide economy and the semiconductor industry  or iv any failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results 
in accordance with fasb asc topic  the company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if the company believes indicators of impairment exist 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the evaluations 
it is possible  however  that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analysis  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges in a future period 
our available for sale investments  non marketable securities and other investments are subject to a periodic impairment review pursuant to fasb asc topic  investments debt and equity securities 
investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary 
this determination requires significant judgment and actual results may be materially different than our estimate 
marketable securities are evaluated for impairment if the decline in fair value below cost basis is significant and or has lasted for an extended period of time 
non marketable securities or other investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary 
for investments accounted for using the cost method of accounting  we evaluate information eg  budgets  business plans  financial statements in addition to quoted market prices  if any  in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value exists 
factors indicative of an other than temporary decline include recurring operating losses  credit defaults  and subsequent rounds of financings at an amount below the cost basis of the investment 
this list is not all inclusive and we weigh all quantitative and qualitative factors in determining if an other than temporary decline in value of an investment has occurred 
when a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary  we recognize an impairment loss in the current period s operating results to the extent of the decline 
actual values could be different from those estimated by management  which could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
see note marketable securities and note non marketable securities of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item in accordance with statement of fasb asc topic  income taxes  we provide for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
the company evaluates the ability to realize its deferred tax assets by using a three year forecast to determine the amount of net operating losses and other deferred tax assets that would be utilized if we achieved the results set forth in the three year forecast 
the company limited the forecast period to three years because of the cyclical and competitive nature of the semiconductor industry  and the company s reliance on a key customer who accounted for approximately percent of total sales in fiscal year there can be no assurance that we will achieve the results set forth in our three year forecast and our actual results may differ materially from our forecast 
page of 
table of contents we have provided a valuation allowance against a portion of our net us deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding their realization 
we evaluate our ability to realize our deferred tax assets basis by determining whether or not the anticipated future taxable income is expected to be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax assets that we have recognized 
if our future income is not sufficient to utilize the deferred tax assets that we have recognized  we increase the valuation allowance to the point at which all of the remaining recognized deferred tax assets will be utilized by the future taxable income 
if our anticipated future taxable income is sufficient to conclude that additional deferred tax assets should be recognized  we decrease the valuation allowance 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdiction 
if our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results  an additional tax benefit or charge will result 
see note income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item restructuring charges for workforce reductions and facilities consolidations reflected in the accompanying financial statements were accrued based upon specific plans established by management  in accordance with fasb asc topic  exit or disposal cost obligations 
we use an estimated borrowing rate as the discount rate for all of our restructuring accruals made under fasb asc topic our facilities consolidation accruals are based upon our estimates as to the length of time a facility would be vacant  as well as the amount of sublease income we would receive once we sublet the facility  after considering current and projected market conditions 
changes in these estimates could result in an adjustment to our restructuring accruals in a future quarter  which could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
see note restructuring costs and other of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item we are subject to the possibility of loss contingencies for various legal matters 
see note legal matters of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether any accruals should be made based on the status of the case  the results of the discovery process and other factors 
if we ultimately determine that an accrual should be made for a legal matter  this accrual could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position and the ultimate outcome may be materially different than our estimate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks associated with interest rates on our debt securities  currency movements on non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities  and the effect of market factors on the value of our non marketable equity securities 
we assess these risks on a regular basis and have established policies that are designed to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses as of march  actual results may differ materially 
interest rate risk our primary financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and accrued liabilities 
the company s investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by the company 
these guidelines include security type  credit quality  and maturity  and are intended to limit market risk by restricting the company s investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively short term maturities 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio and the current low interest rate environment  our downside exposure to interest rate risk is minimal 
to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio  we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio 
at march   an immediate one percent  or basis points  increase or decrease in interest rates could result in a million fluctuation in our annual interest income 
however  our page of 
table of contents investment portfolio holdings as of march   yielded less than basis points  which reduces our downside interest rate risk to the amount of interest income recognized in fiscal year  or million 
at march   an immediate one percent  or basis points  increase or decrease in interest rates could result in a million fluctuation in our annual interest income 
however  our investment portfolio holdings as of march   yielded less than basis points  which reduced our downside interest rate risk to an amount slightly less than the million calculation 
at march   an immediate one percent  or basis points  increase or decrease in interest rates could have resulted in a million fluctuation in our annual interest income 
for all of these fiscal years  the risks associated with fluctuating interest rates were limited to our annual interest income and not the underlying principal as we generally have the ability to hold debt related investments to maturity 
the amounts disclosed in this paragraph are based on a basis point fluctuation in interest rates applied to the average cash balance for that fiscal year 
foreign currency exchange risk our revenue and spending is transacted primarily in us dollars  however  in fiscal years   and  we entered into minimal transactions in other currencies to fund the operating needs of our design  technical support  and sales offices outside of the us as of march   and march   a ten percent change in the value of the related currencies would not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates on the value of open exchange contracts  we may  from time to time  have changes in exchange rates that can also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales prices of our products and the relative costs of operations based overseas
