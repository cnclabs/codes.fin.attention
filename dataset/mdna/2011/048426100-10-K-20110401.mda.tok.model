item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  comparison of financial condition at december  and  allowance for loan losses 
the following table sets forth the amounts and categories of non performing assets in the bank s loan portfolio 
at december  dollars in thousands non accrual loans real estate one to four family commercial other construction one to four family commercial acquisition development other home equity consumer commercial business total non accrual loans non accrual troubled debt restructurings real estate one to four family commercial other construction one to four family commercial acquisition development other home equity consumer commercial business total non accrual troubled debt restructurings total non performing loans real estate owned real estate one to four family commercial other construction one to four family commercial acquisition development other home equity consumer commercial business total real estate owned total non performing assets total troubled debt restructurings total accruing troubled debt restructurings total impaired loans including troubled debt restructurings ratios non performing loans to total loans non performing loans to total assets non performing assets to total assets consists of land and multi family loans 
at december   the bank had million in non performing loans  or of total loans 
our largest concentration of non performing loans at december  was million in non performing one to four family residential real estate loans 
at december   of the non performing one to four family residential real estate loans were jumbo loans loan amount exceeds  totaling million 
due to the decline in real estate values over the last months  the company believes it is appropriate and prudent to reduce the carrying balance of non performing one to four family residential loans by the expected loss amount rather than providing a general allowance 
accordingly  as of december  our non performing one to four family residential loans balance was net of million of partial charge offs 
other non performing real estate loans  consisting of land and multi family real estate loans  totaled million at december  land loans made to two commercial borrowers for the development of residential subdivisions or to purchase single family residential lots for builder inventory comprised million of that total 
we have established a specific allocation of  for these loans which are in the process of foreclosure as of december  non performing commercial real estate construction loans at december  consisted of a million loan participation secured by a condominium hotel project located near disney world in orlando 
we are not the lead lender on this loan 
this loan is in the process of foreclosure 
the bank recorded a million charge off on this loan during non performing commercial real estate loans at december  totaled million and consisted of five loans  one of which totaled approximately million and is secured by commercial real estate 
the following table shows the geographic location of our non accrual loans by state as of december  florida georgia other states total dollars in thousands non accrual loans by state real estate loans one to four family commercial other real estate construction loans one to four family commercial other other loans home equity consumer commercial business total consists of land and multi family loans 
troubled debt restructurings 
troubled debt restructurings increased million to million at year end  from million as of year end  due to our proactive approach and strategy in modifying one to four family residential mortgage loans when a borrower s financial circumstances prevented them from performing under the original terms of the loan 
troubled debt restructured loans are reported as performing upon the later of the loan performing according to its modified terms for a period of six consecutive months or until the following calendar year 
of the million in troubled debt restructurings   was included in non accrual loans 
there were no further commitments to customers whose loans are troubled debt restructurings at december  any changes or modifications made to loans are carefully reviewed to determine whether they are troubled debt restructurings 
any loan modifications made due to financial difficulties of the borrower where a concession is made are reported as troubled debt restructurings 
any other changes or modifications made for borrowers who are not experiencing financial difficulties are done on an infrequent basis 
real estate owned and other repossessed assets 
real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned 
at the time of foreclosure or repossession  the property is recorded at the lower of its estimated fair value less selling costs or the loan balance  with any write down charged against the allowance for loan losses 
other repossessed assets are recorded at the lower of the loan balance or fair market value 
as of december   the bank had real estate owned of million  an increase of million from december  classified assets 
banking regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets  such as debt and equity securities considered by the bank and regulators to be of lesser quality  as substandard  doubtful or loss 
an asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard  with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered not collectable and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted 
when an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful  it may establish general allowances for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management and approved by the board of directors 
general allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities  but which  unlike specific allowances  have not been allocated to particular problem assets 
when an insured institution classifies problem assets as loss  it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge off such amount 
an institution s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the ots and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  which may order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances 
in connection with the filing of the bank s regulatory reports with the ots and in accordance with its classification of assets policy  management regularly reviews the problem assets in the portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with applicable regulations 
the total amount of classified assets represented of the bank s equity capital and of the bank s total assets at december  the aggregate amount of classified loans at the dates indicated was as follows at december  dollars in thousands substandard doubtful loss total loans considered doubtful were  at december   a decrease of million from million at year end loans considered substandard were million  down from million at year end as there has been some stabilization in general economic conditions including unemployment and real estate values 
loans are considered as special mention when it is determined a loan relationship should be monitored more closely 
loans are considered as special mention for a variety of reasons including changes in recent borrower financial condition  changes in borrower operations  changes in value of available collateral  concerns regarding changes in economic conditions in a borrower s industry  and other matters 
a loan considered as special mention in many instances may be performing in accordance with the loan terms 
special mention loans were million and million at december  and  respectively 
as of december  million of classified loans were on non accrual status  as compared to million at year end allowance for loan losses 
an allowance for loan losses allowance is maintained to reflect probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on ongoing assessments of the estimated losses incurred in the loan portfolio and is established as these losses are recognized through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings 
generally  loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
due to declining real estate values in our markets and the deterioration of the united states economy in general  it is increasingly likely that impairment reserves on non performing collateral dependent loans  particularly one to four family residential loans  will not be recoverable and represent a confirmed loss 
as a consequence the company recognizes the charge off of impairment reserves on non performing one to four family residential loans in the period the loan is classified as such 
this process accelerates the recognition of charge offs but has no impact on the impairment evaluation process 
the reasonableness of the allowance is reviewed and established by management  within the context of applicable accounting and regulatory guidelines  based upon its evaluation of then existing economic and business conditions affecting the bank s key lending areas 
senior credit officers monitor the conditions discussed above continuously and reviews are conducted quarterly with bank s senior management and the board of directors 
management s methodology for assessing the reasonableness of the allowance consists of several key elements  which include a general loss component by type of loan and specific allowances for identified problem loans 
the allowance also incorporates the results of measuring impaired loans 
the general loss component is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loan balances based on the internal risk evaluation of the loans or pools of loans 
changes to the risk evaluations relative to both performing and non performing loans affect the amount of this component 
loss factors are based on the bank s recent loss experience  current market conditions that may impact real estate values within the bank s primary lending areas  and on other significant factors that  in management s judgment  may affect the ability to collect loans in the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
other significant factors that exist as of the balance sheet date that may be considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance include credit quality trends including trends in non performing loans expected to result from existing conditions  collateral values  geographic foreclosure rates  new and existing home inventories  loan volumes and concentrations  specific industry conditions within portfolio segments and recent charge offs experience in particular segments of the portfolio 
the impact of the general loss component on the allowance began increasing during and has continued to increase during and the increases reflect the deterioration of market conditions  and the increase in the recent loan experience that has resulted from management s proactive approach to charging off losses on impaired loans 
management also evaluates the allowance for loan losses based on a review of certain large balance individual loans 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows management expects to receive on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change 
for all specifically reviewed loans where it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the terms of the loan agreement  impairment is determined by computing a fair value based on either discounted cash flows using the loan s initial interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans  such as individual consumer and residential loans are collectively evaluated for impairment and are excluded from the specific impairment evaluation 
for these loans  the allowance for loan losses is calculated in accordance with the allowance for loan losses policy described above 
accordingly  we do not separately identify individual consumer and residential loans for impairment disclosures 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million or of the total loan portfolio and of total non performing loans 
assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective and requires making material estimates  including the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change 
in management s opinion  the allowance for loan losses represents all known and inherent loan losses that are both probable and reasonably estimated as of december  the following table sets forth activity in our allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated 
year ended december  dollars in thousands balance at beginning of period charge offs real estate loans one to four family commercial other land multi family real estate construction loans construction one to four family construction commercial acquisition development other loans home equity consumer commercial total charge offs recoveries real estate loans one to four family commercial other land multi family real estate construction loans construction one to four family construction commercial acquisition development other loans home equity consumer commercial total recoveries net charge offs provision for loan losses balance at end of period net charge offs to average loans during this period net charge offs to average non performing loans during this period allowance for loan losses to non performing loans allowance as of total loans end of period total loans are net of deferred fees and costs and purchase premiums or discounts 
loan charge offs in and included million and million  respectively  of partial charge offs of non performing one to four family residential loans 
these loans are expected to be resolved with no additional material loss  absent further declines in the fair value of the collateral  or decision to sell loans as distressed assets 
during the year ended december   loan charge offs included also million related to the sale of million of non performing one to four family residential loans and million on one commercial loan for which a specific allowance had previously been established

the following table summarizes the allocation of the allowance for loan losses on loans by loan category at the dates indicated

the bank is required by federal regulations to maintain an amount of liquid assets  such as cash and short term securities  for the purposes of meeting operational needs 
the bank is also permitted to make certain other securities investments 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and commitments 
cash flow projections are regularly reviewed and updated to assure that adequate liquidity is provided 
the bank is authorized to invest in various types of liquid assets  including us treasury obligations  securities of various federal agencies and government sponsored enterprises  certain certificates of deposit of insured banks and savings institutions  certain bankers acceptances  repurchase agreements and federal funds 
subject to various restrictions  federal savings associations may also invest their assets in investment grade commercial paper and corporate debt securities and mutual funds whose assets conform to the investments that a federally chartered savings association is otherwise authorized to make directly 
see supervision and regulation for a discussion of additional restrictions on the bank s investment activities 
the board of directors has adopted an investment policy which governs the nature and extent of investment activities  and the responsibilities of management and the board 
investment activities are directed by the chief financial officer and the treasurer in coordination with the company s asset liability committee 
various factors are considered when making decisions  including the marketability  maturity and tax consequences of the proposed investment 
the maturity structure of investments will be affected by various market conditions  including the current and anticipated short and long term interest rates  the level of interest rates  the trend of new deposit inflows  and the anticipated demand for funds via deposit withdrawals and loan originations and purchases 
the structure of the investment portfolio is intended to provide liquidity when loan demand is high  assist in maintaining earnings when loan demand is low and maximize earnings while managing risk  including credit risk  reinvestment risk  liquidity risk and interest rate risk 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset and liability management and market risk 
investment securities 
the bank invests in investment securities  for example united states government sponsored enterprises and state and municipal obligations  as part of its asset liability management strategy 
gaap requires investments be categorized as held to maturity  trading securities or available for sale  based on management s intent as to the ultimate disposition of each security 
securities are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity 
securities are classified as available for sale when they might be sold before maturity 
all of the bank s securities are classified as available for sale 
management evaluates securities for other than temporary impairment otti at least on a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation 
in evaluating otti  management considers many factors  including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions  and whether the entity has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery 
the assessment of whether an other than temporary decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in time 
the amount of the otti recognized in earnings depends on whether the bank intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the bank will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  less any current period credit loss 
if the bank intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the bank will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  less any current period credit loss  the otti recognized in earnings is equal to the entire difference between its amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
if the bank does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the bank will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss  the otti is separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors 
the amount of the total otti related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized as a charge to earnings 
the amount of the total otti related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes 
the previous amortized cost basis less the otti recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment 
as of december   the company s security portfolio consisted of securities  of which were in an unrealized loss position 
nearly all unrealized losses are related to debt securities whose underlying collateral is residential mortgages 
however  the majority of these securities were issued by government sponsored organizations as discussed below 
at december   approximately million  or of the debt securities held by the company were issued by us government sponsored entities and agencies  primarily fannie mae  freddie mac and ginnie mae  institutions which the government has affirmed its commitment to support 
because the decline in fair value is attributable to changes in interest rates and illiquidity  and not credit quality  and because the company does not have the intent to sell these securities and it is likely it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery  the company does not consider these securities to be other than temporarily impaired at december  the bank recorded other than temporary impairment charges of  see also the item management discussion and analysis securities available for sale 
these charges represent credit losses from our investments in non agency collateralized mortgage obligations  caused by defaults and losses on the underlying mortgages 
as of december  the bank held approximately million of non agency collateralized mortgages 
due to the severe ongoing economic condition there is no assurance that additional losses may not be incurred in the future

deposits the bank offers a variety of deposit accounts to consumers with a wide range of interest rates and terms 
deposits consist of time deposit accounts  savings  money market and demand deposit accounts 
the bank origin as a credit union enables it to enjoy the benefit of long term deposit customers 
historically  the bank has paid attractive rates on deposit accounts 
the bank relies primarily on competitive pricing policies  marketing and customer service to attract and retain these deposits 
additionally  the bank will purchase time deposit accounts from brokers at costs and terms which are comparable to time deposits originated in the branch offices 
the bank had million of brokered deposits at december   which was of total deposits 
see supervision and regulation regulatory agreements with the office of thrift supervision supervisory agreements for additional restrictions on our ability to accept brokered deposits 
the variety of deposit accounts offered has allowed the bank to be competitive in obtaining funds and to respond with flexibility to changes in consumer demand 
as customers have become more interest rate conscious  the bank has become more susceptible to short term fluctuations in deposit flows 
pricing of deposits are managed to be consistent with overall asset liability management  liquidity and growth objectives 
management considers numerous factors including the need for funds based on loan demand  current maturities of deposits and other cash flow needs  rates offered by market area competitors for similar deposit products  current cost of funds and yields on assets  and the alternative cost of funds on a wholesale basis  in particular the cost of advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb 
interest rates are reviewed regularly by senior management as a part of its asset liability management actions 
based on historical experience  management believes the bank s deposits are a relatively stable source of funds 
despite this stability  the bank s ability to attract and maintain these deposits and the rates paid on them has been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions

although deposits are the primary source of funds  the bank may utilize borrowings when it is a less costly source of funds  and can be invested at a positive interest rate spread  when additional capacity is required to fund loan demand or when they meet asset liability management goals 
borrowings have historically consisted primarily of advances from the fhlb of atlanta  however the bank also has the ability to borrow from the federal reserve bank frb of atlanta 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
advances from the fhlb of atlanta may be obtained upon the security of mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
these advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs  each of which has its own interest rate  range of maturities and call features 
at december   the company had million in fhlb advances outstanding

this regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the fdic s deposit insurance fund and depositors 
under this system of federal regulation  financial institutions are periodically examined to ensure that they satisfy applicable standards with respect to their capital adequacy  assets  management  earnings  liquidity and sensitivity to market interest rates 
following completion of its examination  the federal agency critiques the institution s operations and assigns its rating known as an institution s camels rating 
under federal law  an institution may not disclose its camels rating to the public 
atlantic coast bank also is a member of and owns stock in the federal home loan bank of atlanta  which is one of the twelve regional banks in the federal home loan bank system 
atlantic coast bank is also regulated to a lesser extent by the board of governors of the federal reserve system  governing reserves to be maintained against deposits and other matters 
the ots examines atlantic coast bank and prepares reports for the consideration of its board of directors on any operating deficiencies 
atlantic coast bank s relationship with its depositors and borrowers is also regulated to a great extent by federal law and  to a much lesser extent  state law  especially in matters concerning the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of atlantic coast bank s mortgage documents 
any change in these laws or regulations  whether by the fdic  the ots or congress  could have a material adverse impact on atlantic coast financial corporation and atlantic coast bank and their operations

moreover  under the dodd frank act  the functions of the ots relating to savings and loan holding companies and their subsidiaries  as well as rulemaking and supervision authority over thrift holding companies  will be transferred to the federal reserve board 
set forth below is a brief description of certain regulatory requirements that are or will be applicable to atlantic coast financial corporation and atlantic coast bank 
the description below is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed  and is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on atlantic coast financial corporation and atlantic coast bank 
regulatory agreements with the ots supervisory agreements 
effective december   the company  the bank and the ots entered into supervisory agreements 
the agreements provide  among other things  that the bank must submit a written contingency plan by march  in the event the bank is notified by the ots that it has inadequate capital levels for the bank s risk profile and the volume  type and quality of assets held by the bank  the bank and the company must submit for review and non objection by the ots within days and updated yearly  an updated comprehensive business plan for calendar years and that addresses all corrective actions in the bank s and company s examinations relating to the bank s and company s business operations  including plans to improve core earnings and achieve profitability on a consistent basis throughout the term of the business plan and submit quarterly reports to the ots regarding compliance with the plan with any modifications thereto requiring ots prior written non objection  the bank must within days revise its written program for identifying  monitoring and controlling risks associated with concentrations of credit and other assets to address all corrective actions set forth in the bank s examination relating to concentrations of credit  the bank must ensure that its books  records  financial reports and statements are timely and accurately prepared and filed in compliance with all applicable laws  regulations and regulatory guidance  including proper reporting on thrift financial reports with the ots  the bank must within days develop and adhere to a written troubled debt restructurings and loan modification policy which will be provided to the ots within days after adoption by the board of directors  the bank must not purchase additional bank owned life insurance boli or increase its investment in existing boli policies until the bank s boli exposure is within regulatory guidelines of of total capital  the bank must comply with regulations limiting its ability to accept  renew or roll over brokered deposits without receiving the written non objection of the ots  including reducing its level of brokered deposits to million by june   the bank and the company must comply with regulatory prior notification requirements with respect to changes in directors and senior executive officers  the bank will not be permitted to declare a dividend or make any other capital distributions without the prior written approval of the ots  and the mhc cannot declare or pay dividends or make any other capital distributions without prior written ots approval  the bank and the company will not be permitted to enter into  renew  extend or revise any contractual arrangement relating to compensation or benefits for any senior executive officers or directors  unless it provides days prior written notice of the proposed transaction to the ots  the bank may not enter into any arrangement or contract with a third party service provider that is significant to the financial condition of the bank or outside of its normal course of business unless the ots has received days prior written notice of such contract or arrangement and issued its written non objection  the bank and the company may not make any golden parachute payment or prohibited indemnification payment without ots prior written approval  the bank will not be permitted to increase its total assets during any quarter in excess of an amount equal to the net interest credited on deposit liabilities during the prior quarter  without the prior written non objection of the ots  the bank may not engage in any transactions with affiliates without providing days advance written notice to the ots and receiving its written non objection  and the mhc may not incur  issue  renew or rollover any debt or debt securities  increase any current lines of credit  guarantee the debt of any entity  or otherwise incur any additional debt without the prior written non objection of the ots 
the company has also been informed that in a separate agreement  the ots will impose an individual minimum capital requirement for the bank that will require the bank to achieve and maintain levels of capital greater than those required for a federal savings bank to be classified as well capitalized 
the bank anticipates  based upon discussions with the ots that the individual minimum capital requirement will require that atlantic coast bank reach a certain level of core capital by two different dates with the core capital percentage increasing between the two dates 
the bank must maintain these levels until the ots removes the requirement 
until the individual minimum capital requirement is finalized  the bank will not know with certainty the precise capital levels it will be required to reach and maintain or the exact dates when the bank will need to meet such requirements 
memorandum of understanding 
in august  atlantic coast bank entered into a memorandum of understanding with the ots addressing certain areas of its operations 
this memorandum has been superseded by the supervisory agreements 
new federal legislation congress has recently enacted the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act which will significantly change the current bank regulatory structure and affect the lending  investment  trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies 
the dodd frank act will eliminate the bank s current primary federal regulator  the ots  and will require atlantic coast bank to be regulated by the office of the comptroller of the currency the primary federal regulator for national banks 
the dodd frank act also authorizes the board of governors of the federal reserve system to supervise and regulate all savings and loan holding companies like atlantic coast financial corporation in addition to bank holding companies which it currently regulates 
the dodd frank act also requires the federal reserve board to set minimum capital levels for all depository institution holding companies that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries  and the components of tier capital would be restricted to capital instruments that are currently considered to be tier capital for insured depository institutions 
under the dodd frank act  the proceeds of trust preferred securities are excluded from tier capital unless such securities were issued prior to may  by bank or savings and loan holding companies with less than billion of assets 
bank holding companies with assets of less than million are exempt from these capital requirements 
savings and loan holding companies are subject to a five year transition period before the holding company capital requirement will apply 
the legislation also establishes a floor for capital of insured depository institutions that cannot be lower than the standards in effect today  and directs the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements within months that take into account off balance sheet activities and other risks  including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives 
the dodd frank act also creates a new consumer financial protection bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws 
the consumer financial protection bureau has broad rule making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions such as atlantic coast bank  including the authority to prohibit unfair  deceptive or abusive acts and practices 
the consumer financial protection bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than billion in assets 
banks and savings institutions with billion or less in assets will be examined by their applicable bank regulators 
the new legislation also weakens the federal preemption available for national banks and federal savings associations  and gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws 
the legislation also broadens the base for fdic insurance assessments 
assessments will now be based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution 
the dodd frank act also permanently increases the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks  savings institutions and credit unions to  per depositor  retroactive to january   and non interest bearing transaction accounts have unlimited deposit insurance through december  the dodd frank act requires companies to give stockholders a non binding vote on executive compensation and change in control payments  and authorizes the securities and exchange commission to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate their own candidates using a company s proxy materials 
the legislation also directs the federal reserve board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives  regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not 
further  the legislation requires that originators of securitized loans retain a percentage of the risk for transferred loans  directs the federal reserve board to regulate pricing of certain debit card interchange fees and contains a number of reforms related to mortgage origination

this guarantee remains in place until the ots notifies the savings bank that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters  and the ots has the authority to require payment and collect payment under the guarantee

the restriction on brokered deposits may affect the bank s ability to have sufficient liquid assets for the bank s operations or require it to pay higher rates on retail deposits to replace the bank s use of brokered deposits 
these limitations and the other restrictions noted above will limit the company s operations  which may adversely affect its financial performance 
the bank has also been informed that in a separate agreement  the ots will impose an individual minimum capital requirement for the bank that will require the bank to achieve and maintain levels of capital greater than those required for a federal savings bank to be classified as well capitalized 
the bank anticipates  based upon discussions with the ots that the individual minimum capital requirement will require that the bank reach a certain level of core capital by two different dates with the core capital percentage increasing between the two dates 
the bank must maintain these levels until the ots removes the requirement 
until the individual minimum capital requirement is finalized  the bank will not know with certainty the precise capital levels the bank will be required to reach and maintain or the exact dates when the bank will need to meet such requirements 
under ots policy  the company may not commence a supplemental offering until six months after the completion of the conversion offering  and any offering of the company s common stock public or private initiated by the company within months following the completion of the conversion offering is subject to ots review and written non objection  unless the company obtains a waiver from the ots 
as a result  the company may need to reduce its asset size in order to meet the individual minimum capital requirement  which may reduce its earnings 
in the event the company or the bank are in material non compliance with the terms of the supervisory agreements and individual minimum capital requirement  the ots has the authority to subject them to the terms of a more restrictive enforcement order such as a cease and desist order  to impose civil money penalties on them and their directors and officers  and to remove directors and officers from their positions with atlantic coast financial corporation and atlantic coast bank 
the company has experienced net losses for each of the last three fiscal years and we may not return to profitability in the near future 
the company has experienced net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the losses have been primarily caused by a significant increase in non performing assets  which necessitated a provision for loan losses of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   compared to a provision of million for the year ended december  we charged off million of loans during the year ended december  and million of loans during as compared to million of loans during non accrual loans generally loans days or more past due in principal or interest payments decreased to million  or of total loans at december   compared to million  or of total loans at december  we experienced other than temporary impairment losses in our investment portfolio of million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition  during the year ended december   management deemed it appropriate to write off our entire goodwill balance of million  and establish a valuation allowance of of our net deferred tax asset 
as a result of these factors and other conditions such as weakness in our local economy  we may not be able to generate sustainable net income or achieve profitability in the near future 
we may be unable to successfully implement our business strategy and as a result  our financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected 
our future success will depend upon management s ability to successfully implement our new business strategy  which includes expanding our mortgage banking activities and an emphasis on originating loans to small businesses  including loans guaranteed by the united states small business administration 
while we believe we have the management resources and internal systems in place to successfully implement our strategy  it will take time to fully implement our strategy 
we expect that it may take a significant period of time before we can achieve the intended results of our business strategy 
during the period we are implementing our plan  our results of operations may be negatively impacted 
in addition  even if our strategy is successfully implemented  it may not produce positive results 
additionally  future success in the mortgage banking area will depend on management s ability to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated loan originators 
the bank competes against many institutions with greater financial resources to attract these qualified individuals 
failure to recruit and retain adequate talent could reduce our ability to compete successfully and adversely affect our business and profitability 
the geographic concentration in loans secured by one to four family residential real estate may increase credit losses  which could increase the level of provision for loan losses 
as of december   approximately of the total loan portfolio was secured by first or second liens on one to four family residential property  primarily in southeastern georgia and northeastern florida 
the bank had million  or  of our loan portfolio secured by one to four family residential property in georgia and million  or  of such properties in florida 
the downturn in the local and national economy in  and continuing into  particularly affecting real estate values and employment  have adversely affected our loan customers ability to repay their loans 
in the event we are required to foreclose on a property securing a mortgage loans or pursue other remedies in order to protect our investment  we may not be able to recover funds in an amount equal to any remaining loan balance as a result of prevailing economic conditions  real estate values and other factors associated with the ownership of real property 
in particular  the foreclosure process in florida often takes many months to complete  thereby potentially increasing our risk of loss due to the property s deterioration in value during this period 
as a result  the market value of the real estate or other collateral underlying the loans may not  at any given time  be sufficient to satisfy the outstanding principal amount of the loans 
consequently  we would sustain loan losses and potentially incur a higher provision for loan loss expense 
the loan portfolio possesses increased risk due to our number of commercial real estate  commercial business  construction and multi family loans and consumer loans  which could increase the level of provision for loan losses 
the outstanding commercial real estate  commercial business  construction  multi family  and manufactured home  automobile and other consumer loans accounted for approximately of the total loan portfolio as of december  generally  management considers these types of loans to involve a higher degree of risk compared to first mortgage loans on one to four family  owner occupied residential properties 
historically  these loans have had higher risks than loans secured by residential real estate for the following reasons commercial real estate and commercial business loans 
repayment is dependent on income being generated by the rental property or business in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service 
this risk has been exacerbated by the extended recession in commercial real estate and commercial land values  particularly in our markets 
commercial and multi family construction loans 
repayment is dependent upon the completion of the project and income being generated by the rental property or business in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service 
single family construction loans 
repayment is dependent upon the successful completion of the project and the ability of the contractor or builder to repay the loan from the sale of the property or obtaining permanent financing 
multi family real estate loans 
repayment is dependent on income being generated by the rental property in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service 
consumer loans 
consumer loans such as automobile and manufactured home loans are collateralized  if at all  with assets that may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the loan due to depreciation  damage or loss 
if these non residential loans become non performing  we may have to increase our provision for loan losses which would negatively affect our results of operations 
the loan portfolio possesses increased risk due to portfolio lending during a period of rising real estate values  high sales volume activity and historically low interest rate environment 
much of the bank s portfolio lending is in one to four family residential properties generally located throughout southeastern georgia and northeastern florida 
as a result of lending during a period of rising real estate values and historically low interest rates  a significant portion of the loan portfolio is potentially under collateralized given the recent significant decline in real estate values 
sufficient time has not elapsed to ascertain the magnitude of potential losses resulting from lending during a period of intense changes in the real estate market 
additionally  given the historically low interest rate environment over this same period  the adjustable rate loans have not been subject to an interest rate environment that causes them to adjust to the maximum level and may involve repayment risks resulting from potentially increasing payment obligations by borrowers as a result of re pricing 
at december   there were million in adjustable rate loans  which made up of the loan portfolio 
high loan to value ratios on a portion of our residential mortgage loan portfolio expose us to greater risk of loss 
many of our residential mortgage loans are secured by liens on mortgage properties in which the borrowers have little or no equity because of the decline in home values in our market areas 
residential loans with high loan to value ratios will be more sensitive to declining property values than those with lower combined loan to value ratios and  therefore  may experience a higher incidence of default and severity of losses 
in addition  if the borrowers sell their homes  such borrowers may be unable to repay their loans in full from the sale 
as a result  these loans may experience higher rates of delinquencies  defaults and losses 
if the allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual losses  income and capital will be negatively affected 
the bank s allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans  at december  in the event loan customers do not repay their loans according to their terms and the collateral security for the payments of these loans is insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance  the bank may experience significant loan losses 
such credit risk is inherent in the lending business  and failure to adequately assess such credit risk could have a material adverse affect on the bank s financial condition and results of operations 
management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of the borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of the loans 
in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses  management reviews the loan portfolio and our historical loss and delinquency experience  as well as overall economic conditions 
for larger balance non homogeneous real estate loans the estimate of impairment is based on the underlying collateral if collateral dependent  and if such loans are not collateral dependent  the estimate of impairment is based on a cash flow analysis 
if management s assumptions are incorrect  the allowance for loan losses may be insufficient to cover probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio  resulting in additions to the allowance 
the allowance for loan losses is also periodically reviewed by the office of thrift supervision  who may require us to increase the amount 
additions to the allowance for loans losses would be made through increased provisions for loan losses and would negatively affect our results of operations 
the company could record future losses on our holdings of private label securities 
in addition  we may not receive full future interest payments on these securities 
the company owns eight private label collateralized mortgage obligations with an amortized cost basis of million and a fair value of million at december  the original purchase price of these securities was million 
the company recognized total other than temporary impairment of million and million for these securities for the years ended december  and  respectively  of which  and million was credit related losses recorded through our income statement as a reduction of non interest income  and million and  was recorded as an increase to other comprehensive income 
a number of factors or combinations of factors could require management to conclude in one or more future reporting periods that an unrealized loss that exists with respect to our securities portfolio constitutes additional impairment that is other than temporary  which could result in material losses to us 
these factors include  but are not limited to  a continued failure by an issuer to make scheduled interest payments  an increase in the severity of the unrealized loss on a particular security  an increase in the continuous duration of the unrealized loss without an improvement in value or changes in market conditions and or industry or issuer specific factors that would render us unable to forecast a full recovery in value 
in addition  the fair values of securities could decline if the overall economy and the financial condition of some of the issuers continues to deteriorate and there remains limited liquidity for these securities 
future changes in interest rates could impact our financial condition and results of operations 
net income is the amount by which net interest income and non interest income exceeds non interest expense and the provision for loan losses 
net interest income makes up a majority of our income and is based on the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
a substantial percentage of our interest earning assets  such as residential mortgage loans  have longer maturities than our interest bearing liabilities  which consist primarily of savings and demand accounts  certificates of deposit and borrowings 
as a result  our net interest income is adversely affected if the average cost of our interest bearing liabilities increases more rapidly than the average yield on our interest earning assets 
the federal reserve board maintained the federal funds rate at the historically low rate of during and the federal funds rate has a direct correlation to general rates of interest  including our interest bearing deposits 
our mix of asset and liabilities are considered to be sensitive to interest rate changes 
in a low rate environment  we may be susceptible to the payoff or refinance of high rate mortgage loans that could reduce net interest income 
on the other hand  if interest rates rise  net interest income could be reduced because interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  including deposits and borrowings  increases more quickly than interest received on interest earning assets  including loans and mortgage backed and related securities 
in addition  rising interest rates may negatively affect income because higher rates may reduce the demand for loans and the value of mortgage related and investment securities 
operating expenses are high as a percentage of our net interest income and non interest income  making it more difficult to maintain profitability 
non interest expense  which consists primarily of the costs associated with operating our business  represents a high percentage of the income we generate 
the cost of generating our income is measured by our efficiency ratio  which represents non interest expense divided by the sum of our net interest income and our non interest income 
if we are able to lower our efficiency ratio  our ability to generate income from our operations will be more effective 
for the year ended december  and for the years ended december  and  our efficiency ratio was  and  respectively 
generally  this means we spent  and during the years ended  and to generate of income 
this reflects a trend where the efficiency ratio has deteriorated from to for the approximate eight year period ended december  if economic conditions continue to deteriorate or the economic recovery remains slow over an extended period of time in our primary market areas of jacksonville  florida and ware county  georgia  our results of operation and financial condition could be adversely impacted as borrowers ability to repay loans declines and the value of the collateral securing the loan decreases 
financial results may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions  including decreases in real estate values  changes in interest rates  which may cause a decrease in interest rate spreads  adverse employment conditions  the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal and the georgia and florida state governments and other significant external events 
we held approximately of the deposits in ware county  the county in which waycross  georgia is located as of december  we also have approximately of the deposits in the jacksonville  florida  metropolitan area 
additionally  our market share of loans in ware county is significantly greater than our share of the loan market in the jacksonville metropolitan area 
as a result of the concentration in ware county  we may be more susceptible to adverse market conditions in that market 
due to the significant portion of real estate loans in the loan portfolio  decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral 
at december   million  or  of our loan portfolio consisted of real estate secured loans in florida and million  or  of such loans consisted of real estate secured loans in georgia 
adverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans  which would have an adverse impact on earnings 
the unemployment rate for the jacksonville  florida metropolitan area was an estimated as of december  in addition  the jacksonville metropolitan area had the th highest foreclosure rate of one to four family residences in the united states 
the united states economy remains weak and unemployment levels are high 
a prolonged economic downturn  especially one affecting our geographic market area  will adversely affect our business and financial results 
the united states experienced a severe economic recession in and  the effects of which have continued through recent growth has been slow and unemployment remains at high levels and as a result economic recovery is expected to be slow 
loan portfolio quality has deteriorated at many financial institutions reflecting  in part  the weak united states economy and high unemployment rates 
in addition  the value of real estate collateral supporting many commercial loans and home mortgages has declined and may continue to decline 
the real estate downturn also has resulted in reduced demand for the construction of new housing and increased delinquencies in construction  residential and commercial mortgage loans 
bank and bank holding company stock prices have declined substantially  and it is significantly more difficult for banks and bank holding companies to raise capital or borrow funds 
future negative developments in the financial services industry and the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which we do business  the market for and value of our loans and investments  and our ongoing operations  costs and profitability 
we could experience reduced demand for our products and services  increases in loan delinquencies  problem assets or foreclosures  and the collateral for our loans may decline further in value 
moreover  future declines in the stock market in general  or stock values of financial institutions and their holding companies specifically  could adversely affect our stock performance 
the slowing and uncertain economy in florida has negatively impacted our ability to grow loans in our primary market area  and combined with strong competition  may further reduce our ability to obtain loans and also decrease our yield on loans 
from to mid  the jacksonville metropolitan area had been one of the fastest growing economies in the united states 
the area experienced substantial growth in population  new business formation and public works spending 
due to the considerable slowing of economic growth and migration into our market area since mid and the resulting downturn in the real estate market  management believes growth in our market area will be moderate in the near term 
growth in the first mortgage loan portfolio has been negatively impacted by a slowing in existing and new home sales activity in our markets 
a decrease in existing and new home sales decreases lending opportunities  and may negatively affect our income 
in addition  we are located in a competitive market that affects our ability to obtain loans through origination or purchase as well as originating them at rates that provide an attractive yield 
competition for loans comes principally from mortgage bankers  commercial banks  other thrift institutions  nationally based homebuilders and credit unions 
internet based lenders have also become a greater competitive factor in recent years 
such competition for the origination and purchase of loans may limit future growth and earnings prospects 
strong competition in our primary market area may reduce our ability to attract and retain deposits and also increase our cost of funds 
the bank operates in a very competitive market for the attraction of deposits  the primary source of our funding 
historically  our most direct competition for deposits has come from credit unions  community banks  large commercial banks and thrift institutions within our primary market areas 
in recent years competition has also come from institutions that largely deliver their services over the internet 
such competitors have the competitive advantage of lower infrastructure costs and substantially greater resources and lending limits and may offer services we do not provide 
particularly during times of extremely low or extremely high interest rates  we have faced significant competition for investors funds from short term money market securities and other corporate and government securities 
during periods of regularly increasing interest rates  competition for interest bearing deposits increases as customers  particularly time deposit customers  tend to move their accounts between competing businesses to obtain the highest rates in the market 
as a result  atlantic coast bank incurs a higher cost of funds in an effort to attract and retain customer deposits 
we strive to grow our lower cost deposits  such as non interest bearing checking accounts  in order to reduce our cost of funds 
the company may not be able to realize our deferred tax asset 
the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
however  at december   we had no net deferred tax asset 
in  we established a valuation allowance for our net federal and state deferred tax asset after evaluating the positive and negative evidence under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
gaap requires more weight be given to objective evidence  and since realization is dependent on future operating results our three year cumulative operating loss carried more weight than forecasted earnings 
management regularly reviews the deferred tax assets for recoverability based on our history of earnings  expectations for future earnings and expected timing of reversals of temporary differences 
realization of the deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income  including taxable income in prior carryback years  as well as future taxable income 
the net deferred tax asset at december  will not become fully realizable until our expected future earnings will support realization of the asset 
in addition  we will not know the impact of the ownership change from the conversion offering until after it is completed 
if triggered  we believe that the impact on our deferred tax asset could be material 
this is a preliminary and complex analysis and requires us to make certain judgments in determining the annual limitation 
although it is currently not shown as an asset  it is possible that we could ultimately lose a significant portion of the deferred tax asset 
realization of our deferred tax asset would significantly improve our earnings and capital 
wholesale funding sources may prove insufficient to replace deposits at maturity and support our future growth 
the bank must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers 
as a part of our liquidity management  we use a number of funding sources in addition to core deposit growth and repayments and maturities of loans and investments 
as we continue to grow  we are likely to become more dependent on these sources  which include federal home loan bank advances  proceeds from the sale of loans and liquidity resources of the holding company 
at december   we had million of federal home loan bank advances outstanding 
in the past brokered deposits have been solicited as a source of funds 
however  under the supervisory agreement with the office of thrift supervision entered into in december  atlantic coast bank cannot increase its level of brokered deposits over million without prior approval of the office of thrift supervision and must reduce the level of its brokered deposits to million by june  we had million of brokered deposits at december   which was of total deposits 
as our brokered deposits mature  we may have to pay a higher rate of interest to replace them with other deposits or with funds from other sources 
not being able to replace those deposits as they mature could adversely affect our liquidity 
paying higher interest rates to replace those deposits could adversely affect our net interest margin and our operating results 
our financial flexibility will be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain our access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates 
if we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth  our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs 
in this case  our operating margins and profitability would be adversely affected 
atlantic coast bank operates in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations 
atlantic coast bank is currently subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by the office of thrift supervision  its chartering authority  and by the federal deposit insurance corporation  which insures atlantic coast bank s deposits 
as a savings and loan holding company  atlantic coast financial corporation is currently subject to regulation and supervision by the office of thrift supervision 
such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which financial institutions and their holding companies may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the federal deposit insurance fund and depositors 
these regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities  including the imposition of restrictions on the operations of financial institutions  the classification of assets by financial institutions and the adequacy of financial institutions allowance for loan losses 
new financial reform legislation has been enacted by congress that will change the bank regulatory framework  create an independent consumer protection bureau that will assume the consumer protection responsibilities of the various federal banking agencies  and establish more stringent capital standards for banks and bank holding companies 
the legislation will also result in new regulations affecting the lending  funding  trading and investment activities of banks and bank holding companies 
further changes in such regulation and oversight  whether in the form of regulatory policy  regulations  or legislation  could have a material impact on atlantic coast bank and atlantic coast financial corporation 
atlantic coast bank s operations are also subject to extensive regulation by other federal  state and local governmental authorities  and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions that impose requirements and restrictions on operations 
these laws  rules and regulations are frequently changed by legislative and regulatory authorities 
in the future  changes to existing laws  rules and regulations  or any other new laws  rules or regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business  financial condition or prospects 
financial reform legislation recently enacted by congress will  among other things  eliminate the office of thrift supervision  tighten capital standards  create a new consumer financial protection bureau and result in new laws and regulations that are expected to increase our costs of operations 
congress has recently enacted the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act  which will significantly change the current bank regulatory structure and affect the lending  investment  trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies 
the dodd frank act will eliminate our current primary federal regulator  the office of thrift supervision  and require atlantic coast bank to be regulated by the office of the comptroller of the currency the primary federal regulator for national banks 
the dodd frank act also authorizes the board of governors of the federal reserve system to supervise and regulate all savings and loan holding companies like atlantic coast financial corporation  in addition to bank holding companies which it currently regulates 
as a result  the federal reserve board s current regulations applicable to bank holding companies  including holding company capital requirements  will apply to savings and loan holding companies like atlantic coast financial corporation 
these capital requirements are substantially similar to the capital requirements currently applicable to atlantic coast bank  but will not be applicable to atlantic coast financial corporation for five years 
the dodd frank act also requires the federal reserve board to set minimum capital levels for bank holding companies that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries  and the components of tier capital would be restricted to capital instruments that are currently considered to be tier capital for insured depository institutions 
the legislation also establishes a floor for capital of insured depository institutions that cannot be lower than the standards in effect today  and directs the federal banking regulators to implement new leverage and capital requirements within months that take into account off balance sheet activities and other risks  including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives 
the dodd frank act also creates a new consumer financial protection bureau with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws 
the consumer financial protection bureau has broad rule making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions such as atlantic coast bank  including the authority to prohibit unfair  deceptive or abusive acts and practices 
the consumer financial protection bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than billion in assets 
banks and savings institutions with billion or less in assets will be examined by their applicable bank regulators 
the new legislation also weakens the federal preemption available for national banks and federal savings associations  and gives state attorney generals the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws 
the legislation also broadens the base for federal deposit insurance corporation insurance assessments 
assessments will now be based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution 
the dodd frank act also permanently increases the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks  savings institutions and credit unions to  per depositor  retroactive to january   and non interest bearing transaction accounts have unlimited deposit insurance through december  lastly  the dodd frank act will increase stockholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give stockholders a non binding vote on executive compensation and so called golden parachute payments  and by authorizing the securities and exchange commission to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate their own candidates using a company s proxy materials 
the legislation also directs the federal reserve board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives  regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not 
it is difficult to predict at this time what effect the new legislation and implementing regulations will have on community banks with regards to the lending and credit practices of such banks 
moreover  many of the provisions of the dodd frank act will not take effect for at least a year  and the legislation requires various federal agencies to promulgate numerous and extensive implementing regulations over the next several years 
although the substance and scope of these regulations cannot be determined at this time  it is expected that the legislation and implementing regulations  particularly those relating to the new consumer financial protection bureau  will increase our operating and compliance costs 
changes in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and our income 
in response to the financial crisis of and early  congress has taken actions that are intended to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in financial institutions  and the federal deposit insurance corporation has taken actions to increase insurance coverage on deposit accounts 
the dodd frank act and implementing regulations are likely to have a significant effect on the financial services industry  which are likely to increase operating costs and reduce profitability 
in addition  there have been proposals made by members of congress and others that would reduce the amount delinquent borrowers are otherwise contractually obligated to pay on their mortgage loans and limit an institution s ability to foreclose on mortgage collateral 
the potential exists for additional federal or state laws and regulations  or changes in policy  affecting lending and funding practices and liquidity standards 
moreover  bank regulatory agencies have been active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations  and have issued many formal enforcement orders requiring capital ratios in excess of regulatory requirements 
bank regulatory agencies  such as the office of thrift supervision and the federal deposit insurance corporation  govern the activities in which we may engage  primarily for the protection of depositors  and not for the protection or benefit of potential investors 
in addition  new laws and regulations may increase our costs of regulatory compliance and of doing business  and otherwise affect our operations 
new laws and regulations may significantly affect the markets in which we do business  the markets for and value of our loans and investments  the fees we can charge  and our ongoing operations  costs and profitability 
legislative proposals limiting our rights as a creditor could result in credit losses or increased expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor 
risks relating to an investment in common stock stock price may be volatile due to limited trading volume 
the company s common stock is traded on the nasdaq global market 
however  the average daily trading volume in the stock company s common stock is relatively small  approximately  shares per day in  and sometimes significantly less than that 
as a result  trades involving a relatively small number of shares may have a significant effect on the market price of the common stock  and it may be difficult for investors to acquire or dispose of large blocks of stock without significantly affecting the market price 
stock issued pursuant to the exercise of stock options awarded to directors and management will dilute public stockholder ownership 
directors and management currently hold options to purchase approximately  shares of common stock  or of total common stock outstanding 
there are an additional  shares available for future awards of options under the current stock option plan  or of the common stock outstanding 
stock options are paid for by the recipient in an amount equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant 
the payments are not made until the option is actually exercised by the recipient 
the issuance of common stock pursuant to the exercise of total stock options under the stock option plan will result in the dilution of existing stockholders voting interests by unless shares are repurchased to cover such exercise 
ability to pay dividends is limited 
atlantic coast financial corporation s ability to pay dividends is limited by regulatory requirements and the need to maintain sufficient consolidated capital to meet the capital needs of the business  including capital needs related to future growth 
the primary source of income is the payment of dividends from atlantic coast bank to the company 
atlantic coast bank  in turn  is subject to regulatory requirements potentially limiting its ability to pay such dividends and by the need to maintain sufficient capital for its operations and obligations 
thus  there can be no assurance the company will pay dividends to common stockholders  no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such dividends  and no assurance such dividends  if and when paid  will be maintained  at the same level or at all  in future periods 
on september   the company announced that it had suspended its regular quarterly cash dividend

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the bank s principal business consists of attracting deposits from the general public and the business community and making loans secured by various types of collateral  including real estate and other consumer assets 
the bank is significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions  particularly interest rates  as well as government policies and regulations concerning among other things  monetary and fiscal affairs  housing and financial institutions 
attracting and maintaining deposits is influenced by a number of factors  including interest rates paid on competing investments offered by other financial and non financial institutions  account maturities  fee structures  and level of personal income and savings 
lending activities are affected by the demand for funds and thus are influenced by interest rates  the number and quality of lenders and regional economic growth 
sources of funds for lending activities of the bank include deposits  borrowings  payments on loans  maturities of securities and income provided from operations 
earnings are primarily dependent upon net interest income  which is the difference between interest income and interest expense and the provision for loan losses 
interest income is a function of the balances of loans and investments outstanding during a given period and the yield earned on such loans and investments 
interest expense is a function of the amount of deposits and borrowings outstanding during the same period and interest rates paid on such deposits and borrowings 
provision for loan losses results from actual incurred losses when loans are charged off and the collateral is insufficient to recover unpaid amounts  as well as an allowance for estimated future losses from uncollected loans 
earnings are also affected by the bank s service charges  gains and losses from sales of loans and securities  commission income  interchange fees  other income  non interest expenses and income taxes 
non interest expenses consist of compensation and benefit expenses  occupancy and equipment costs  data processing costs  fdic insurance premiums  outside professional services  interchange fees  advertising expenses  telephone expense  and other expenses 
earnings may also be negatively impacted by the entry of the company and the bank into supervisory agreements with the office of thrift supervision

critical accounting policies certain accounting policies are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition  since they require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments  some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances  including  but without limitation  changes in interest rates  performance of the economy  financial condition of borrowers and laws and regulations 
management believes that its critical accounting policies include determining the allowance for loan losses  determining other than temporary impairment of securities  the valuation of goodwill and accounting for deferred income taxes 
accounting policies are discussed in detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item allowance for loan losses an allowance for loan losses allowance is maintained to reflect probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on ongoing assessments of the estimated losses incurred in the loan portfolio and is established as these losses are recognized through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings 
generally  loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibity of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
due to declining real estate values in our markets and the weak united states economy in general  it is increasingly likely that impairment reserves on non performing collateral dependent loans  particularly one to four family residential loans  will not be recoverable and represent a confirmed loss 
as a consequence the company recognizes the charge off of impairment reserves on non performing one to four family residential loans in the period the loan is classified as such 
this process accelerates the recognition of charge offs but has no impact on the impairment evaluation process 
the reasonableness of the allowance is reviewed and established by management  within the context of applicable accounting and regulatory guidelines  based upon its evaluation of then existing economic and business conditions affecting the bank s key lending areas 
senior credit officers monitor the conditions discussed above continuously and reviews are conducted quarterly with the bank s senior management and board of directors 
management s methodology for assessing the reasonableness of the allowance consists of several key elements  which include a general loss component by type of loan and specific allowances for identified problem loans 
the allowance also incorporates the results of measuring impaired loans 
the general loss component is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loan balances based on the internal risk evaluation of the loans or pools of loans 
changes to the risk evaluations relative to both performing and non performing loans affect the amount of this component 
loss factors are based on the bank s recent loss experience  current market conditions that may impact real estate values within the bank s primary lending areas  and on other significant factors that  in management s judgment  may affect the ability to collect loans in the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
other significant factors that exist as of the balance sheet date that may be considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance include credit quality trends including trends in non performing loans expected to result from existing conditions  collateral values  geographic foreclosure rates  new and existing home inventories  loan volumes and concentrations  specific industry conditions within portfolio segments and recent charge offs experience in particular segments of the portfolio 
the impact of the general loss component on the allowance began increasing during and continued to increase during and the increase reflected the deterioration of market conditions  and the increase in the recent loan loss experience that has resulted from management s proactive approach to charging off losses on impaired loans 
management also evaluates the allowance for loan losses based on a review of certain large balance individual loans 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including the amounts and timing of future cash flows management expects to receive on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change 
for all specifically reviewed loans where it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the terms of the loan agreement  impairment is determined by computing a fair value based on either discounted cash flows using the loan s initial interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
no specific allowance is recorded unless fair value is less than carrying value 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans  such as individual consumer and residential loans are collectively evaluated for impairment and are excluded from the specific impairment evaluation  for these loans  the allowance for loan losses is calculated in accordance with the allowance for loan losses policy described above 
accordingly  individual consumer and residential loans are not separately identified for impairment disclosures 
the allowance for loan losses was million at december   and million at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was at december   and as of december  the provision for loan losses for each quarter of and  and the total for the respective years is as follows in millions first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter total this data demonstrates the manner in which the allowance for loan losses and related provision expense can change over long term and short term periods 
changes in economic conditions  the nature and size of the loan portfolio and individual borrower conditions can dramatically impact the required level of allowance for loan losses  particularly for larger individually evaluated loan relationships  in relatively short periods of time 
the allowance for loan losses allocated to individually evaluated loan relationships was million at december  and million at december   a decrease of million 
this decrease primarily reflected the charge off of one large central florida commercial real estate loan 
given the rapidly changing and uncertain real estate market coupled with changes in borrowers financial condition  weakening of collateral values  and the overall economic conditions  management anticipates there will continue to be significant changes in individual specific loss allocations in future periods as these factors are difficult to predict and can vary widely as more information becomes available or as projected events change 
fair value of securities available for sale management evaluates securities for other than temporary impairment otti at least on a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation 
in determining otti  management considers many factors  including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions  and whether the entity has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery 
the assessment of whether an other than temporary decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at a point in time 
when otti is determined to have occurred  the amount of the otti recognized in earnings depends on whether the company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  less any current period credit loss 
if the company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  less any current period credit loss  the otti recognized in earnings is equal to the entire difference between its amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
if the company does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss  the otti is separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors 
the amount of the total related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized as a charge to earnings 
the amount of the otti related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes 
the previous amortized cost basis less the otti recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment 
the company recorded an otti charge of  for the year ended december  valuation of goodwill goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment  more frequently if events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist 
the recessionary economic conditions significantly affected the banking industry in general  and have had an adverse impact on our financial results 
financial results for were negatively impacted by an increase in credit losses in the bank s loan portfolio  a lower net interest margin due to increased balances of non performing loans  recognition of other than temporary impairment otti on certain of the company s available for sale securities and higher loan collection expenses 
the company s stock price had continued to trade at a price below book value since the fourth quarter of accordingly  an assessment of goodwill impairment was performed during the third quarter of in advance of the date of normal annual review 
based on the results of that analysis  an impairment charge of million was recorded in the third quarter of  leaving no goodwill on the balance sheet at december  this non cash charge had no impact on liquidity  regulatory capital or its well capitalized status 
deferred income taxes after converting to a federally chartered savings bank  atlantic coast bank became a taxable organization 
income tax expense benefit is the total of the current year income tax due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary difference between carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities  computed using enacted tax rates and operating loss carryforwards 
the company s principal deferred tax assets result from the allowance for loan losses and operating loss carryforwards 
a valuation allowance  if needed  reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the internal revenue code and applicable regulations are subject to interpretation with respect to the determination of the tax basis of assets and liabilities for credit unions that convert charters and become a taxable organization 
atlantic coast financial corporation records income tax expense based upon management s interpretation of the applicable tax regulations 
positions taken by the company in preparing our federal and state tax returns are subject to the review of taxing authorities  and the review by taxing authorities of the positions taken by management could result in a material adjustment to the financial statements 
all available evidence  both positive and negative  is considered when determining whether or not a valuation allowance is necessary to reduce the carrying amount to a balance that is considered more likely than not to be realized 
the determination of the realizability of deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management s evaluation of such evidence 
positive evidence considered includes the probability of achieving forecasted taxable income and the ability to implement tax planning strategies to accelerate taxable income recognition 
negative evidence includes the company s cumulative losses 
following the initial establishment of a valuation allowance in  if the company is unable to generate sufficient pre tax income in future periods or otherwise fails to meet forecasted operating results  an additional valuation allowance may be required 
any valuation allowance is required to be recorded during the period identified 
as of december   the company had a valuation allowance of million  or of the net deferred tax asset 
business strategy overview 
our primary objective is to remain an independent  community oriented financial institution  serving customers in our primary market areas while providing stockholders a solid long term return on capital 
to accomplish this objective management is implementing strategies designed to return the company to profitability consistent with safety and soundness considerations 
these strategies are focused on credit management and reducing the cost of non performing assets  increasing revenues from mortgage banking and small business lending activities that maximize profits but with lower capital requirements  increasing core deposits to improve our cost of funds and to reduce our cost structure 
the following are the key elements of our new business strategy continuing our proactive approach to reducing non performing assets by aggressive resolution and disposition initiatives 
as a result of the decline in our local economy beginning in  the bank experienced a substantial increase in our non performing assets 
at december   our non performing assets were million as compared to million at december  management has instituted a proactive strategy to aggressively reduce non performing assets through accelerated charge offs  loan work out programs  enhanced collection practices  the use of distressed asset sales and improved risk management 
an aggressive charge off policy 
beginning in  management began to implement an aggressive charge off strategy for one to four family residential mortgage loans and home equity loans by taking partial or full charge offs in the period that such loans became non accruing 
loan work out programs 
we remain committed to working with responsible borrowers to renegotiate residential loan terms 
the bank had million in troubled debt restructurings at december   compared to million at december  only  of our troubled debt restructurings at december  was non performing in accordance with their revised terms 
troubled debt restructurings avoid the expense of foreclosure proceedings and holding and disposition expenses of selling foreclosed property  and provide us increased interest income 
enhanced collection practices 
in  due to the elevated delinquency of our one to four family residential mortgage loans and the increasing complexity of working out these types of loans  management engaged the services of a national third party servicer for certain loans 
one to four family residential mortgage loans  and any associated home equity loan that becomes days past due  are assigned to the third party servicer for collection 
the bank also assigns other one to four family residential mortgage loans to the third party servicer irrespective of delinquency status if it is determined the loan may have higher than normal collection risk 
at december   the outstanding balance of loans assigned to the third party servicer was million 
non performing asset sales 
in order to reduce the expenses of the foreclosure process  including the sale of foreclosed property  the bank has sold certain non performing loans through national loan sales of distressed assets  which may mitigate future losses 
from to december   the bank sold million of loans through distressed asset sales resulting in a loss on such sales of million 
the bank anticipates continued distressed asset sales in the future to dispose of non performing assets when management believes it will result in the least overall loss to the company 
the bank also has accepted short sales of residential property by borrowers where such properties are sold at a loss and the proceeds of such sales are paid to us 
credit risk management 
the bank is also enhancing credit administration by improving internal risk management processes 
in  an independent risk committee of our board of directors was established to evaluate and monitor system  market and credit risk 
increasing revenue by expanding our mortgage banking operations and an increased emphasis on commercial lending to small businesses 
historically  atlantic coast bank has emphasized the origination of one to four family residential mortgage loans in northeastern florida and southeastern georgia 
at december   our one to four family residential loan portfolio was million  or  of our loan portfolio 
during late  the bank began to originate mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market on a limited scale 
as a result of our internal evaluation  management intends to shift our business model to emphasize mortgage banking operations and the sale of originated mortgage loans 
mortgage banking strategy 
the bank intends to regularly sell fixed and adjustable rate  conforming residential loans originated  including the related servicing  to generate increased fee income 
management believes legislative changes in the near term create an opportunity to expand this business by hiring local mortgage bankers and leveraging their already existing origination platforms 
we began implementing this strategy in late by organizing a management team and revising operations to accommodate the expected growth 
we now have loan production offices in the states of new york  pennsylvania and new jersey and are considering other expansion and delivery opportunities for in the latter part of  the bank also began a program for warehouse lending where we finance mortgages originated by third parties and hold a lien position for a short duration usually less than days while earning interest until a sale is completed to an investor 
management expects to expand this aspect of mortgage banking in the future 
commercial lending strategy 
management also plans to increase commercial business lending and owner occupied commercial real estate lending with an emphasis on small businesses  subject to regulatory capital requirements 
the bank intends to participate in government programs relating to commercial business loans such as the us small business administration and the us department of agriculture 
the bank began to implement this strategy in september  by hiring an executive to lead the small business lending along with an experienced us small business administration lending team 
our focus on owner occupied commercial real estate loans will be to professional service businesses 
the bank intends to target principal balances of up to million in our commercial business and owner occupied commercial real estate lending  while not originating or purchasing higher risk loans such as commercial real estate development projects  multi family loans and land acquisition and development loans 
growing our core deposit base 
the bank remains committed to generating lower cost and more stable core deposits 
the bank attracts and retains transaction accounts by offering competitive products and rates  excellent customer service and a comprehensive marketing program 
the bank continues to emphasize offering core deposits to individuals  businesses and municipalities located in our market area 
our core deposits consisting of demand  savings and money market accounts increased million to million at december  from million at december  at december   core deposits comprised of our total deposits  compared to of our total deposits at december  core deposits are our least costly source of funds  which improves our interest rate spread and also contributes non interest income from account related services 
expansion through acquisition opportunities 
we believe acquisition opportunities will exist inside our current market area for the next several years  including fdic assisted transactions  which may afford us the opportunity to add complementary products to our existing business or to expand our market reach geographically 
any expansion through acquisition will follow the company s return to profitability and will likely require the company to raise capital to support the growth 
there are currently no understandings or agreements for any specific merger or acquisition 
it is anticipated that our entering into a supervisory agreement with the office of thrift supervision will limit our ability to execute acquisitions in the near term 
comparison of financial condition at december  and december  general 
in order to maintain its well capitalized status  the company strategically reduced total assets  primarily during the fourth quarter of total assets decreased million to million at december  as compared to million at december  specifically the bank decreased net loans by million  investments in available for sale securities by million and cash and cash equivalents by million 
these reductions were partially offset by an increase in loans held for sale of million 
core deposits consisting of demand  savings and money market accounts grew by a combined million  while time deposits decreased by million and federal home loan bank advances decreased by million 
following is a summarized comparative balance sheet as of december  and december  increase decrease dollars percentage dollars in thousands assets cash and cash equivalents securities available for sale loans held for sale loans allowance for loan losses loans  net other assets total assets liabilities and stockholders equity deposits non interest bearing demand interest bearing demand savings and money market time total deposits securities sold under agreement to repurchase federal home loan bank advances other borrowings accrued expenses and other liabilities total liabilities total stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents are comprised of cash on hand and interest earning and non interest earning balances held in other depository institutions 
throughout the course of cash and cash equivalents were lower as compared to previous years due to the decline in total deposits  primarily time deposits 
as opportunities became available excess cash was invested in short term cash management accounts at other banks until more permanent and higher yielding assets were identified 
management expects the balances in cash and cash equivalents will continue to fluctuate as other interest earning assets mature  but generally be held at balances necessary to meet liquidity requirements while excess amounts are deployed to higher yielding assets 
the company believes it has sufficient contingent liquidity sources to meet liquidity demands 
securities available for sale 
securities available for sale is comprised primarily of debt securities of us government sponsored enterprises  and mortgage backed securities 
the investment portfolio decreased approximately million to million at december   net of purchases  sales and maturities  as these proceeds were primarily re invested in loans held for sale 
in order to reduce the risk of additional other than temporary impairment charges  the company sold six securities totaling million at a loss of million during expense for other than temporary impairment otti of  was recorded in non interest income  primarily on three private label mortgage backed securities for the year ended december  the table below shows the cost basis  fair value  number of securities and otti recorded for all collateralized mortgage obligations cmos at december  dollars in thousands amortized fair number of cost value securities otti collateralized mortgage obligations other with otti collateralized mortgage obligations other with no otti collateralized mortgage obligations other total the primary causes for the otti were high credit default rates and high loss severity experienced on certain mezzanine support bonds 
at december   approximately million  or of the debt securities held by the company were issued by us government sponsored entities and agencies  primarily fannie mae  freddie mac and ginnie mae  institutions which the government has affirmed its commitment to support 
because the decline in fair value was attributable to changes in interest rates and illiquidity  and not credit quality  and because the company does not have the intent to sell these securities and it is likely it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery  the company does not consider these securities to be other than temporarily impaired at december  approximately million of the company s available for sale securities are collateral for structured transactions entered into during and under agreements to repurchase see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations securitites sold under agreements to repurchase 
these transactions were entered into by the company to take advantage of favorable interest rate spreads and to reduce overall exposure to interest rate risk at that time 
as a result of the unprecedented decline in interest rates  as well as illiquidity in the mortgage backed securities market  coupled with the overall decline in the bank s credit quality  the bank has been subject to margin and fair value calls from the third party counterparties to the repurchase agreements which has necessitated the bank to post additional collateral to cover the outstanding securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
additionally  given the collateral requirements of these transactions  the current interest rate environment and the illiquidity in the marketplace  the liquidity of the available for sale securities portfolio is currently limited 
management will continue to evaluate its options as the economic environment improves and liquidity returns to the marketplace 
loans held for sale 
loans held for sale are comprised entirely of loans secured by one to four family residential homes originated internally or purchased from third party originators 
as of december   the weighted average number of days outstanding of real estate mortgages held for sale was days 
during the year ended december  the company originated a total of million of loans held for sale  comprised of approximately million of loans originated internally  and approximately million of loans purchased from third parties 
approximately million of the loans were sold  resulting in a gain of  and interest earned of million on outstanding balances was recorded in interest income 
the company intends to continue to focus on opportunities to grow this line of business in the near future due to its favorable margins and efficient capital usage

the sale of portfolio loans was undertaken as a part of the bank s capital preservation strategy 
total portfolio loan originations increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  until critical economic factors such as unemployment and residential real estate values stabilize  management believes portfolio loan balances will continue to decline 
for a discussion regarding the effects of the decline in property values on the bank s one to four family residential loan portfolio  see lending activities one to four family real estate portfolio lending 
however  due to a favorable interest rate environment  production of one to four family loans held for sale in the secondary market is expected to continue its moderate pace 
the strategy of selling the majority of originated loans in the secondary market also compliments the bank s desire to reduce portfolio loan balances in order to maximize capital efficiently 
the composition of the bank s loan portfolio is heavily weighted toward one to four family residential loans 
as of december   first mortgages including residential construction loans  second mortgages and home equity loans totaled million  or of total gross loans

charge offs also included million on one commercial construction real estate loan for which a specific allowance had previously been established 
due to the decline in real estate values over the past two years  management believes it is appropriate and prudent to reduce the carrying balance of non performing one to four family residential loans by the expected loss amount which is both probable and reasonable to estimate rather than providing a general allowance 
the decrease in the provision for loan losses of million in as compared to was primarily due to a million general reserve established in for manufactured housing loans held in portfolio  previously supported by a cash deposit maintained with the company by the originator of the loans that was settled in non performing assets

total impaired loans increased million to million at december  from million at december  as of december   total non performing one to four family residential loans of million included million of one to four family residential loans that had been written down to the estimated fair value of their collateral 
further declines in the fair value of the collateral  or a decision to sell loans as distressed assets  could result in additional losses 
the total allowance allocated for impaired loans decreased to million at december  from million at december  as of december   and december   all non performing loans were classified as non accrual  and there were no loans days past due and accruing interest as of december   and december  troubled debt restructured loans were million as of december   as compared to million at december  these loans were primarily comprised of residential mortgage loans collateralized by real estate and were evaluated for impairment as required under gaap 
the increase in non performing commercial real estate and commercial loans was primarily due to a million loan relationship with a manufacturer of commercial cabinet systems consisting of loans secured by the company s facilities and a line of credit secured by inventory and accounts receivable 
the borrower declared bankruptcy in december and is currently operating under a court ordered plan requiring monthly adequate protection payments to the bank 
the million decrease in non performing other real estate loans was primarily the result of the transfer of seven lending relationships into other real estate owned during the loans included a million unit condominium project adjacent to walt disney world near orlando  florida 
the remaining loans were primarily parcels of land originally intended for single family residential housing in northeast florida 
a comparison of the allowance for loan losses on loans to non performing loans as of december  is summarized as follows non performing loans amount of general and specific loan loss allowance of loan loss allowance to non performing loans dollars in thousands real estate loans one to four family commercial other land multi family real estate construction construction one to four family construction commercial acquistion development other loans home equity consumer commercial totals a comparison of the allowance for loan losses on loans to non performing loans as of december  is summarized as follows non performing loans amount of general and specific loan loss allowance of loan loss allowance to non performing loans dollars in thousands real estate loans one to four family commercial other land multi family real estate construction construction one to four family construction commercial acquistion development other loans home equity consumer commercial totals the allowance for loan losses allocated for one to four family residential loans as of december  included a provision of million as a result of its review of the effect of the slowdown in the foreclosure process in florida and the estimated impact on collateral valuations in the one to four family residential portfolio 
at december   the bank had no loans delinquent days or more that were accruing interest 
at december  and  loans days or more past due and non accrual loans as a percentage of total loans were and of total assets  respectively 
for the year ended december   contractual gross interest income of million would have been recorded on non performing loans if those loans had been current

impaired loans 
the following table shows impaired loans split between performing and non performing and the associated specific reserve as of december balance specific reserve balance specific reserve accruing non accruing tdr non accruing commercial tdr non accruing residential tdr accruing commercial tdr accruing residential impaired loans include large non homogenous loans where it is probable that the bank will not receive all principal and interest when contractually due and troubled debt restructurings tdr with borrowers where the bank has granted a concession to the borrower because of their financial difficulties 
impaired loans that were also non performing decreased as described above  declining as a percentage of total non performing loans to at december   as compared to at year end the decreased specific reserve for non performing impaired loans was primarily the result of the charge off of one large commercial loan in central florida 
tdrs increased million at year end  as compared to the year end due to the bank s proactive approach to modifying one to four family mortgages when a borrower s financial circumstances prevented them from performing under the original terms of the loan 
at december   approximately million or of the tdr s were one to four family or consumer loans of which approximately  was not performing according to the restructured terms 
deferred income taxes 
as of both december  and  the bank concluded that  while improved operating results are expected as the economy begins to improve and our non performing assets decline  the variability of the credit related costs are such that a more likely than not conclusion of realization of our deferred tax asset could not be supported 
consequently  management recorded a valuation allowance of million for the full amount of the net federal and state deferred tax assets as of december  until such time as the determination is made it is more likely than not that the company is able to generate taxable income  no tax benefits will be recorded in future periods to reduce net losses before taxes 
however  at such time in the future that we record taxable income or determine that realization of the deferred tax asset is more likely than not  some or all of the valuation allowance may be available as a tax benefit 
deposits 
total deposit account balances were million at december   a decrease of million from million at december  time deposits decreased million but core deposits increased million as consumers demonstrated a preference for shorter duration  more liquid deposit products rather than re investing in time deposits due to the low interest rate environment 
the increase in core deposits occurred as depositors increased their non interest bearing demand accounts million and also increased their interest bearing demand accounts million 
as a part of its capital preservation strategy  the bank intentionally lowered rates on time deposits beginning in the second half of in order to reduce those deposits consistent with loan balance decreases 
management believes near term deposit growth will be moderate with an emphasis on core deposits to match asset growth expectations 
dramatic changes in the short term interest rate environment could affect the availability of deposits in our local market however and therefore cause the bank to promote time deposit growth in order to meet liquidity needs 
under atlantic coast bank s supervisory agreement with the office of thrift supervision dated december   the bank may not increase brokered deposits without prior written approval 
per the terms of the agreement the bank must have no more than million of brokered deposits outstanding as of june  at december  the bank had brokered deposits of million 
the company s management does not believe the restriction has a significant effect on the company s liquidity

federal home loan bank advances 
fhlb advances of million had a weighted average maturity of months and a weighted average rate of at december  the million decrease in fhlb borrowings at december  as compared to december  was due to repayments of million offset by additional borrowings of million 
the company expects to continue to utilize fhlb advances to manage both short and long term liquidity needs to the extent it has borrowing capacity  needs funding and the interest expense of fhlb advances is attractive compared to deposits and other alternative sources of funds 
other borrowings 
other borrowings were million at december  the company borrowed million  at market rate  from another financial institution in june which was secured by shares of the company s common stock owned by atlantic coast federal  mhc 
terms of the note were as follows through june   subsequently a rate per annum equal to the greater of or the sum of the us treasury securities rate plus basis points  payable in twelve quarterly installments of  plus interest  commencing on june   final due date june  the company s chairman of the board also serves as the president and chief executive officer and a director of the financial institution from which the borrowing was obtained 
the company contributed million to atlantic coast bank as additional capital and used the remaining proceeds to pay off the remaining balance of million of other borrowings 
upon completion of the second step conversion on february   the company paid off the million borrowing from the offering proceeds 
stockholders equity stockholders equity decreased by approximately million to million at december  from million at year end  due to the net loss of million for the year ended december  which was partially offset by the million increase in other comprehensive income 
other comprehensive income for the year ended december  increased by million due to higher market values on available for sale securities 
going forward  management expects changes in interest rates and market liquidity to continue to cause swings in unrealized gains and losses from available for sale securities 
during and  the company implemented strategies to preserve capital including the suspension of cash dividends and its stock repurchase program 
resumption of these programs is not expected to occur in the near term 
the company s equity to asset ratio decreased to at december   from at december  the decrease was due to the net loss of million for the year ended december  partially offset by the increase in other comprehensive income 
despite this decrease  atlantic coast bank continued to exceed all minimum regulatory capital requirements  and is considered well capitalized under ots regulations

comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and general 
the company s net loss for the year ended december   was million  as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  the decreased net loss was primarily due to the improvement in our net interest margin which resulted in a million increase in net interest income  a million decrease in our provision for loan losses  a decrease in other than temporary impairment otti expense for investment securities of million 
in addition  the results of operations in were not affected by one time charges in consisting of the establishment of a valuation allowance for federal deferred tax assets  and the loss from impairment of goodwill which collectively decreased our net loss in as compared to by approximately million 
net interest income increased  or million in the year ended december  to million  as compared to  as the decrease in rates paid on interest bearing liabilities more than exceeded the reduced interest income on interest earning assets 
the provision for loan losses was million in  a decrease of from million in non interest income for the year ended december  increased by to million  as compared to million in  due primarily to lower other than temporary impairment charges on available for sale securities

interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as shown in the table above the decrease in interest income for the year ended december   as compared to  was primarily due to a decrease in average balances of interest earning assets 
the decline of interest income earned on loans was due to payoffs on higher rate one to four family loans as borrowers refinanced at historically low rates 
the decrease in average outstanding balances of one to four family real estate loans for the year ended december   as compared to  accounted for the majority of the total million decrease in average loan balances 
interest income earned in from securities decreased by approximately  due to an basis point decrease in average rates on new purchases of comparable securities  which was partially offset by higher average outstanding balances as a result of reinvesting liquidity from loan pay offs securities 
our interest income could continue to decrease in the near term by continued low interest rates and limited loan growth 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense for the year ended december   as compared to  was primarily due to lower interest rates paid on average outstanding balances of deposit accounts and fhlb advances as well as the lower average balances of these interest bearing liabilities which decreased by million 
during the year ended december   the federal reserve board maintained the target rate for federal funds borrowings at

management assesses the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and makes provisions for loan losses as necessary in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses based on all known and inherent losses that are both probable and can be reasonably estimated 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future loan loss provisions may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and changes in borrower situations 
in addition  the office of thrift supervision  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require additional provisions based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination 
provision for loan losses of million and million were made during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in provision for loan losses in as compared to was primarily due to a one time million additional provision in resulting from a settlement agreement with an on going third party originator whereby the company assumed responsibility for credit losses on a pool of loans as well as the million decrease in the balance of portfolio loans

the company recorded other than temporary impairment otti charges of  during as compared to million during  resulting in an improvement of approximately million 
see also the item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations comparison of financial condition at december  and securities available for sale 
these charges represent credit losses from our investments in non agency collateralized mortgage obligations  caused by defaults and losses on the underlying mortgages 
as of december  the bank held approximately million of non agency collateralized mortgages 
due to the weak ongoing economic conditions there is no assurance that additional losses may not be incurred in the future 
the million decrease in other non interest income was the result of two non recurring items in  a gain of approximately  on the sale of the lake city branch on december  and approximately million resulting from a settlement agreement with an on going third party originator whereby the company assumed responsibility for credit losses on a pool of loans 
the decrease in loss on sale of loans for the year ended december  as compared to  results from bulk sales of non performing one to four family residential loans through a third party national sales advisor 
this approach is occasionally used when management believes it will reduce ongoing collection costs and  ultimately  result in the least cost to the bank 
the bank incurred losses of million on such sales in services charges and fees  which are earned primarily based on transaction services for deposit account customers  decreased as a result of decreased activity resulting in lower atm and check card overdraft fees 
the amount of overdraft fees may be impacted in the future as a result of the recently issued guidelines on overdraft guidelines 
these guidelines  which are scheduled for implementation july   place restrictions on frequency and amount of overdraft fees financial institutions are permitted to charge customers

for the year ended december   non interest expense included two non recurring transactions that nearly offset 
during the third quarter of  the company wrote off the entire amount of goodwill resulting in a loss of million 
in the fourth quarter of  the company revised supplemental executive retirement plans resulting in a reversal of million of expense 
management expects non interest expenses will increase in  primarily as a result of the expansion of new business initiatives 
income tax expense 
income tax expense decreased to for the year ended december   from a tax expense of million for the establishment of a valuation allowance of approximately million during resulted in a much higher tax expense than what may be expected based upon our pre tax loss 
the valuation allowance also caused significant distortion in the effective income tax rate on income before income taxes for the year ended december   which was  compared to for comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and general 
our net loss for the year ended december   was million  as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  the increased net loss was primarily due to significant increases in our provision for loan losses  the establishment of a valuation allowance for federal deferred tax assets  an other than temporary impairment otti expense for investment securities and a loss from impairment of goodwill which collectively increased our net loss in as compared to by approximately million 
the increases to provision for loan losses and the otti were directly correlated to the impact of the severe economic recession on our loan customers and the assets underlying our mortgage backed security investments 
the resulting impact of these expenses on net earnings led to the decision that goodwill was impaired and that our deferred tax assets may not be realized from future taxable income 
net interest income decreased  or million in the year ended december  to million  as compared to  as the benefits of a reduction in interest expense of million was offset by a decrease in interest income of million  as the slight decline in average interest earning assets combined with the decrease in the interest yield on such assets exceeded the decrease in rates paid on higher average interest bearing liabilities 
based on the geographic concentration of the company loan portfolio in the northeast florida market  the weakening of specific loan participations as described under non performing assets  continued industry wide credit quality concerns and the rapidly changing and uncertain real estate market conditions  the provision for loan losses was million  an increase of from million in non interest income for the year ended december  decreased by to million  as compared to million in  due primarily to other than temporary impairment otti charges on available for sale securities  a loss on the sale of non performing loans  and the receipt last year of certain life insurance proceeds  which were partially offset by a gain on a cash deposit settlement 
non interest expense decreased to million in from million for the year ended december  due to general cost reduction measures during the year and non recurring expenses associated with the death of an executive officer in  which more than offset the impact of a non cash goodwill write off during the year

average non performing loans increased approximately million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in reducing interest income earned on loans by approximately million 
the remaining decline of interest income earned on loans was due to payoffs on higher rate one to four family loans as borrowers refinanced at historically low rates

provision for loan losses of million and million were made during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in the provision for loan losses was primarily due to increased charge offs of residential and other consumer loans reflecting the impact on consumers of the extended recession evidenced by higher unemployment  increase foreclosures and declines in the number and average sales price of residential real estate in our market areas

other components include higher fdic insurance premiums as result of the fdic special assessment in the second quarter of  and higher premium rates 
the loss on sale of foreclosed assets was the result of increased foreclosure activity associated with the continued weakness in the real estate market

atlantic coast financial corporation relies on a number of different sources in order to meet its potential liquidity demands 
the primary sources of funds are increases in borrowings  deposit accounts and cash flows from loan payments and securities sales 
the scheduled amortization of loans and securities as well as proceeds from borrowings  are predictable sources of funds 
other funding sources  however  such as inflows from new deposits  mortgage prepayments and mortgage loan sales are greatly influenced by market interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
in addition to these primary sources of funds  management has several secondary sources available to meet potential funding requirements 
as of december   and december  the company had additional borrowing capacity of million and million  respectively  with the fhlb of atlanta 
additionally  the company had existing lines of credit available in excess of million with another financial institution 
management believes the majority of atlantic coast financial corporation s securities portfolio is of investment grade quality and the securities would therefore be marketable 
the company also can utilize brokers to obtain certificates of deposits at costs and terms that are comparable to certificate of deposits originated in its branch network  subject to limitations in our supervisory agreement with the ots 
as of december  and  the company had million and million of certificates of deposits obtained through brokers that were purchased to replace maturing branch originated certificates of deposits or to help meet loan demands 
as of december  and these certificates of deposits had a weighted average maturity of months and months  and a weighted average rate of and  respectively

the company suspended its repurchase program in march initiation of future share repurchase programs is dependent on liquidity  opportunities for alternative investments and capital requirements 
under ots regulations  atlantic coast financial corporation cannot repurchase shares for one year following its second step conversion 
management monitors the capital levels of atlantic coast bank to provide for current and future business opportunities and to meet regulatory guidelines for well capitalized institutions

as described in item a risk factors and item business supervision and regulation  the company has entered into a supervisory agreement with the office of thrift supervision dated december   and has been informed that in a separate agreement the ots will impose an individual minimum capital requirement for the bank 
the impact of these agreements may have a material effect on the company s liquidity  capital resources or operations 
inflation the effects of price changes and inflation can vary substantially for most financial institutions 
while management believes that inflation affects the growth of total assets and our profitability  management believes that it is difficult to assess the overall impact 
management believes this to be the case due to the fact that generally neither the timing nor the magnitude of inflationary changes in the consumer price index cpi coincides with changes in interest rates 
the price of one or more components of the cpi may fluctuate considerably and thereby influence the overall cpi without having corresponding affect on interest rates or upon the cost of those goods and services normally purchased by us 
in years of high inflation and high interest rates  intermediate and long term interest rates tend to increase  thereby adversely impacting the market values of investment securities  mortgage loans and other long term fixed rate loans 
in addition  higher short term interest rates caused by inflation tend to increase the cost of funds 
in other years  the opposite may occur 
off balance sheet arrangements as a financial services provider  we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risks  such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit 
while these contractual obligations represent our potential future cash requirements  a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans we make 
in addition  we enter into commitments to sell mortgage loans

in order to minimize the potential for adverse effects of material prolonged increases or decreases in interest rates on our results of operations  management has adopted an asset and liability management policy 
the board of directors sets the asset and liability management policy for us  which is implemented by the asset liability committee 
the purpose of the asset liability committee is to communicate  coordinate and control asset liability management consistent with our business plan and board approved policies 
the asset liability committee establishes and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources taking into account relative costs and spreads  interest rate sensitivity and liquidity needs 
the objectives are to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk  and profitability goals 
the asset liability committee generally meets at least monthly to review  among other things  economic conditions and interest rate outlook  current and projected liquidity needs and capital position  anticipated changes in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities and interest rate exposure limits versus current projections pursuant to market value of portfolio equity analysis and income simulations 
the asset liability committee recommends appropriate strategy changes based on this review 
the asset liability committee is responsible for reviewing and reporting the effects of the policy implementations and strategies to the board of directors at least quarterly 
a key element of our asset liability plan is to protect net earnings by managing the maturity or re pricing mismatch between our interest earning assets and rate sensitive liabilities 
historically  management has sought to reduce exposure to earnings through the use of adjustable rate loans and through the sale of certain fixed rate loans in the secondary market  and by extending funding maturities through the use of fhlb advances 
net portfolio value 
the office of thrift supervision requires the computation of amounts by which the net present value of an institution s cash flow from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items the institution s net portfolio value or npv would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
given the current relatively low level of market interest rates  an npv calculation for an interest rate decrease of greater than basis points has not been prepared 
a basis point equals one hundredth of one percent  and basis points equals one percent 
an increase in interest rates from to would mean  for example  a basis point increase in the change in interest rates column below 
net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income the bank earns on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
in our model  management estimates what net interest income would be for a rolling forward twelve month period using historical data for assumptions such as loan prepayment rates and deposit decay rates  the current term structure for interest rates  and current deposit and loan offering rates 
we then calculate what the net interest income would be for the same period in the event of an instantaneous  and basis point increase or a basis point decrease in market interest rates 
at december  npv as a percentage of net interest income present value of assets increase decrease in change in increase estimated net interest interest estimated decrease in decrease estimated income rates basis estimated npv npv ratio basis net interest points npv amount percent points income amount percent in thousands assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities 
npv is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest earning assets 
pv ratio represents npv divided by the present value of assets 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in determining interest rate risk through changes in net portfolio value and net interest income 
modeling changes require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the net portfolio value and net interest income information presented assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assume that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although interest rate risk calculations provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results
