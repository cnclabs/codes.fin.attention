item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides an analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the discussion contains statements  which  to the extent that they are not a recitation of historical facts  constitute forward looking statements pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of all statements  other than statements of historical fact  including statements about product development  market and industry trends  strategic initiatives  regulatory approvals  sales  profits  expenses  price trends  research and development expenses and trends  and capital expenditures  we make in this document or in any document incorporated by reference are forward looking 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors  which may cause our actual results  performance  or achievements to differ from the projected results 
see risk factors in item a for a discussion of the primary risks and uncertainties known to us at this time 
our management s discussion and analysis is presented in six sections as follows business overview fiscal year overview results of operations liquidity and capital resources critical accounting policies new accounting pronouncements we report our financial condition and results of operations on a fiscal year basis ending july all dollar amounts in this item are in thousands except per share data 
business overview analogic is a high technology company that designs and manufactures advanced medical imaging and security systems and subsystems sold to oems and end users primarily in the healthcare and airport security markets 
we were incorporated in the commonwealth of massachusetts in november and are recognized worldwide for advancing state of the art technology in the areas of medical ct  ultrasound  mri  digital mammography  and automated explosive detection systems for airport security 
our oem customers 
table of contents incorporate our technology into systems they in turn sell for various medical and security applications 
we also sell our ultrasound products directly into clinical end user markets through our direct worldwide sales force under the brand name b k medical 
we operate primarily within two major markets medical technology and security technology 
medical technology consists of two reporting segments medical imaging and ultrasound 
security technology is a single reporting segment 
a significant portion of our products are sold to oems  whose purchasing dynamics have an impact on our reported sales 
oems that purchase our medical imaging products generally incorporate those products as components in their systems  which are in turn sold to end users  which are primarily hospitals and medical clinics 
in our security technology business  a major oem customer purchases and resells our products to end users including domestic and foreign airports as well as the u 
s transportation security administration tsa 
in security technology  our oem customers purchasing dynamics are affected by the level of government funding  the expansion of airport terminals and fluctuations in airline passenger volume 
fiscal year overview the following table sets forth the percentage of total net revenue by reporting segment for fiscal years and all periods presented have been revised accordingly to reflect new reporting segments 
fiscal year medical technology medical imaging ultrasound total medical technology security technology total the following is a summary of the metrics that our management believes are most important in understanding our results of operations for the periods indicated 
this summary is not a substitute for the detail provided in the following pages or for the audited consolidated financial statements and notes that appear elsewhere in this document 
fiscal year percentage change total net revenue gross profit gross margin income from operations operating margin percentage net income diluted net income per share total net revenue increased  or  in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  due primarily to the increase in net revenue of  for the medical imaging segment of our medical technology business from increased demand for new and existing products 
gross profit increased  to  in fiscal operating expenses increased by  due primarily to declines in r d funding from our customers  increases in restructuring charges and sales channel expenses  and an increase in non cash share 
table of contents based compensation costs primarily associated with the increased accrual for performance based awards as a result of improving company financial performance 
net income and diluted net income per share benefited from a lower tax rate in fiscal year  primarily as a result of the full year benefit of the federal research and experimentation credit  the tax benefit of for the reinstatement of the federal research and experimentation credit back to january   lower foreign tax rates as compared to the u 
s statutory rate of  and the discrete benefit of from the reversal of tax reserves as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations for the fiscal year and settlements with various taxing authorities 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we sold our hotel business  and realized net proceeds of  after transaction costs 
we recorded a gain on sale of the hotel business of  net of a tax provision of  or per diluted share in fiscal year the hotel business  previously reported in the other segment  is being reported as a discontinued operation and all periods presented have been revised accordingly to reflect these operations as discontinued 
revenue and net income loss for the hotel business for fiscal years   and were as follows year ended july  total net revenue net income loss we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of  and  at july  and  respectively 
the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents over the past month continued to be impacted by the global decline in interest rates 
we have historically invested our cash and cash equivalents primarily in u 
s government backed securities  bonds  and certificates of deposit 
the interest rates of these instruments have remained low over the last year 
as of july  our investment portfolio primarily consisted of demand deposits at highly rated banks and financial institutions 
the following table sets forth an overview of our cash flows for fiscal years and year ended july  net cash provided by continuing operations for operating activities net cash used by provided by continuing operations for investing activities net cash used for financing activities net cash used by provided by discontinued operations effect of exchange rate changes on cash net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents during fiscal year  we generated  of cash from operating activities of continuing operations as compared to  in the prior year 
the increase was due primarily to an increase in sales volumes partially offset by increased operating expenses 
net cash used by continuing operations for investing activities in fiscal year was due primarily to capital spending of  which includes the construction of a manufacturing facility in shanghai  china 
the capital spending was partially offset by  of proceeds from the sale of our hotel business 
the net cash used for financing activities in fiscal year primarily reflected  used to repurchase common stock

fiscal year percentage of net revenue research and product development selling and marketing general and administrative restructuring charges total operating expenses 
table of contents research and product development expenses are related to projects not funded by our customers 
these expenses increased  in fiscal year versus the prior year due primarily to an increase in self funded development projects associated with new product introduction and advanced development 
also contributing to the growth was an increase in share based compensation expense of  in fiscal year versus the prior year primarily associated with the increased accrual for performance based awards as a result of improving company financial performance 
selling and marketing expenses increased  in fiscal year versus the prior year due primarily to an increase in selling resources in the ultrasound segment as we expanded our sales force and product offerings in existing and adjacent markets 
general and administrative expenses remained relatively consistent  increasing in fiscal year versus the prior year including share based compensation expense  which increased by  in fiscal year versus the prior year primarily associated with the increased accrual for performance based awards as a result of improving company financial performance 
the increase in share based compensation was offset by a net of tax bargain purchase gain of  related to the acquisition of an oem ultrasound transducer and probe business in november restructuring charges in fiscal year includes severance and personnel related costs for our plan to reduce our headcount by employees worldwide 
we expect that this restructuring will result in annual expense savings of approximately  a portion of which will fund strategic growth initiatives 
restructuring charges in fiscal year included severance and personnel related costs for the termination of employees worldwide

discontinued operations discontinued operations for fiscal year as compared with fiscal year is summarized in the table below 
year ended july  income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax during the first quarter of fiscal year  we sold our hotel business 
the increase in income from discontinued operations  net of tax  in fiscal year versus the prior year was due primarily to increased occupancy and higher room rates at the hotel due primarily to the improving economy in the three months ended october  as compared to fiscal year income from continuing operations and diluted net income per share from continuing operations income from continuing operations and diluted net income per share from continuing operations for fiscal years and were as follows year ended july  income from continuing operations of net revenue diluted net income per share from continuing operations the increases in income from continuing operations and diluted net income per share from continuing operations for fiscal year versus the prior year was due primarily to increased sales volumes and gross margin partially offset by increased operating expenses

year ended july  percentage change product revenue medical technology medical imaging ultrasound total medical technology security technology total 
table of contents medical imaging the increase in product revenue for our medical imaging segment for fiscal year versus the prior year was due primarily to increases in demand by our oem customers as a result of the improvement in hospital spending on capital equipment  as well as the impact of new products introduced in fiscal year also contributing to the increase in product revenue were increased shipments of mammography detectors to oem customers outside the united states 
ultrasound the increase in ultrasound product revenue in fiscal year versus the prior year was due primarily to increases in demand for our new product lines  the flex focus and pro focus ultraview ultrasound scanners  which were introduced late in the second and third quarters of fiscal year  respectively  the improvement in hospital spending on capital equipment in general  and expansion of our direct sales force 
security technology the decrease in product revenue for security technology in fiscal year versus the prior year was due primarily to the fluctuating demand by our oem customer as a result of changing requirements and procurement procedures in the united states by the tsa 
this decrease was offset in large part by an increase in sales of spare parts and accessories and initial revenues from the introduction of our new high speed explosives detection system  which was certified by the tsa in fiscal year engineering revenue engineering revenue for fiscal year as compared with fiscal year is summarized in the table below 
year ended july  percentage change engineering revenue medical technology medical imaging ultrasound total medical technology security technology total medical imaging the decrease in medical imaging engineering revenue in fiscal year versus the prior year was due primarily to the timing of completed milestones on projects for various oem customers 
security technology the increase in security technology engineering revenue in fiscal year versus the prior year was due primarily to an engineering project that began in december for an oem customer 
this was partially offset by a decrease in engineering revenue on a time and materials project with an oem customer to transition the high speed xlb explosive detection system from a prototype into a manufacturable product 

table of contents gross margin product gross margin product gross margin for fiscal year as compared with fiscal year is summarized in the table below 
year ended july  percentage change product gross profit product gross margin product gross margin percentage increased in fiscal year versus the prior year due primarily to lower labor costs as a result of restructuring  improved manufacturing efficiency as a result of higher production throughput and improved component pricing from our vendors 
engineering gross margin engineering gross margin for fiscal year as compared with fiscal year is summarized in the table below 
year ended july  percentage change engineering gross profit loss  n a engineering gross margin the increases in the engineering gross margin in fiscal year versus the prior year was due primarily to the improved pricing for non recurring engineering projects undertaken for oem customers partially offset by costs in excess of revenues on medical imaging business projects 
we incurred a gross loss on engineering revenue in fiscal year primarily as a result of the write down of deferred engineering costs of due to the settlement agreement that was reached with cas medical systems  inc cas in august and costs incurred in excess of revenue on certain customer funded medical imaging projects 
operating expenses operating expenses decreased  or  in fiscal year as compared with fiscal year as shown below 
fiscal year percentage of net revenue research and product development selling and marketing general and administrative restructuring charges total operating expenses research and product development expenses increased  for fiscal year versus the prior year due primarily to an increase in performance based variable cash and share based compensation expense of  as a result of improved operating results 
these increases were partially offset by realizing the benefit of the workforce reductions that took place in fiscal year selling and marketing expenses increased for fiscal year versus the prior year due primarily to an increase in performance based variable cash and share based compensation expense of as a result of 
table of contents improved operating results 
also contributing to the increase were increased sales commissions of due to increased sales of ultrasound products and expansion of our direct sales force 
these increases were partially offset by realizing the benefit of the workforce reductions that took place in fiscal year general and administrative expenses increased  for fiscal year versus the prior year due primarily to an increase in performance based variable cash and share based compensation expense of  as a result of improved operating results 
these increases were partially offset by realizing the benefit of the workforce reductions that took place in fiscal year   of contingent professional fees related to income tax refunds and related interest of  received from the irs and the state of massachusetts in fiscal year  and related to the settlement agreement reached with cas in august restructuring charges decreased  for fiscal year versus the prior year 
the fiscal year amount includes severance and personnel related costs of for involuntary terminations and for facility exit costs primarily related to our office facility in canton  ma 
this was offset in part by a reversal of prior year severance and related benefit expenses of due to a change in estimated severance benefits and changes in the employee population expected to receive such benefits 
the fiscal year amount includes severance and personnel related costs of  for involuntary terminations and  for facility exit costs primarily related to vacating of our office facility in canton  ma on july  as a result of moving certain operations to our peabody  ma facility 
other income expense year ended july  interest income  net gain on sale of other investments other income expense the decrease in net interest income in fiscal year versus the prior year was due primarily to a decline in interest rates 
the gain on sale of other investments for fiscal year was due to the receipt of escrow proceeds of in fiscal year relating to the sale of our ownership interest in another company during fiscal year net other expense during fiscal years and consisted predominantly of foreign currency exchange losses from our canadian  danish  and british subsidiaries 
provision benefit for income taxes year ended july  provision benefit for income taxes effective tax rate for fiscal year  the effective tax rate of as compared to the us statutory rate of was due primarily to lower foreign tax rates and discrete benefits of approximately  due primarily to the reversal of tax reserves as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations for fiscal years and in fiscal year and the settlement of foreign and domestic tax audits 
also contributing to the reduced effective tax rate were federal research and experimentation credits 
for fiscal year  the benefit for income taxes was due primarily to irs refunds of  received in fiscal year the refunds  which included  of interest  were for the carryback of a loss and research 
table of contents and development credits from fiscal year and from additional research and development tax credits and timing items claimed on amended income tax returns for fiscal years through we had recognized  of these refunds and related interest within stockholders equity in fiscal year the impact of these refunds and related interest was a reduction of unrecognized tax benefits by approximately  of which  was recorded as a tax benefit in fiscal year also contributing to the benefit for income taxes in fiscal year was  for the reversal of a valuation allowance on belgium net operating loss carryforwards that management has determined are more likely than not to be recognized and the reversal of of tax reserves due to the expiration of statutes of limitations 
these benefits were partially offset by additional provisions for agreed federal and state adjustments and typical taxes owed related to our operations in that period 
income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax discontinued operations revenue for fiscal year as compared with fiscal year is summarized in the table below 
year ended july  income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax the decreases in fiscal year versus the prior year was due primarily to lower occupancy and a decline in room rates at the hotel due to lower business and personal travel as a result of the continuing economic pressures in the consumer market 
income from continuing operations and diluted net income per share from continuing operations net income and diluted net income per share for fiscal years and were as follows year ended july  income from continuing operations of net revenue diluted net income per share from continuing operations the increase in net income and diluted net income per share for fiscal year versus the prior year was due primarily to increases in sales volumes and gross margins driven by increased demand in the medical technology business 
also contributing to the increases were lower restructuring charges in fiscal year versus the prior year 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest income  an increase in performance based variable cash and share based compensation expense as a result of improved operating results  and lower income tax benefits 
liquidity and capital resources key liquidity and capital resources information is summarized in the table below 
july  july  cash and cash equivalents working capital short and long term debt stockholders equity the increase in working capital from july  to july  was due primarily to increases in inventories and accounts receivable of  and  respectively  reflecting increased customer demand and increased sales volumes during fiscal year as well as stocking associated with consolidation of our manufacturing operations and establishing our shanghai manufacturing facility 
these increases were partially offset by increases in account payable due primarily to timing of vendor payments 

table of contents we periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investments are impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns 
we believe that our cash equivalents were appropriately valued at july  and we are not aware of any market events that would impact their valuation 
this could change in the future should new developments arise in the credit markets 
we face exposure to financial market risks  including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates  and changes in interest rates 
these exposures can change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our primary exposure is related to fluctuations between the us dollar and local currencies for our subsidiaries in canada  europe  and china 
our investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on our net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity 
a depreciation in the july  and functional currencies  relative to the us dollar  would result in a reduction of stockholders equity of approximately  and  respectively 
the carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables  and trade payables approximate fair value at july   due to the short maturities of these instruments 
cash and cash equivalents totaled  at july  and consisted entirely of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the time of purchase 
cash flows the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash over the periods indicated year ended july  net cash provided by continuing operations for operating activities net cash used by provided by continuing operations for investing activities net cash used for financing activities net cash used by provided by discontinued operations effect of exchange rate changes on cash net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents the cash flows generated from operating activities of our continuing operations in fiscal year primarily reflects our pre tax earnings from continuing operations of  which included depreciation and amortization expenses of  and non cash share based compensation expense of  the positive impact of our operating earnings on cash flows  excluding the non cash acquisition related bargain purchase gain of  was partially offset by increases in inventories and accounts receivable of  and  respectively  which were net of increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  and  respectively  as well as a decrease in other assets of  the increase in inventories of  was due primarily to demand related inventory increases and planned increases in ultrasound and medical imaging inventories associated with the shift in production from denmark to the united states and china 
the increase in accounts receivable of  was due primarily to growth in net revenue as well as an increase in unbilled receivables of  on engineering projects due to the timing of completing milestones 
the increase in accounts payable of  was due primarily to the timing of vendor payments and increased inventory purchases 
the increase in accrued liabilities of  was due primarily to the restructuring charges of  partially offset by payments made for the restructuring charges 
the net cash used by continuing operations for investing activities in fiscal year was due primarily to purchases of property  plant  and equipment of  of which approximately  relates to the construction of a manufacturing facility in shanghai  china 
these uses of cash were partially offset by the net proceeds of  from the sale of our hotel business 

table of contents the net cash used for financing activities in fiscal year primarily reflected  used to repurchase common stock and  of dividends paid to stockholders 
we believe that our balances of cash and cash equivalents and cash flows expected to be generated by future operating activities will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months 
commitments  contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements our contractual obligations at july   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in future periods are as follows contractual obligation total less than year years more than years years more than years operating leases purchasing obligations as of july   the total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions were  due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties  we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non current liabilities associated with these uncertain tax positions 
therefore  these amounts have not been included in the contractual obligations table 
we currently have approximately  in revolving credit facilities with banks available for direct borrowings 
our revolving credit facility agreements contain a number of covenants  including a covenant requiring us to maintain a tangible net worth as defined in the revolving credit facility agreement of no less than  as of the end of any fiscal quarter 
we were in compliance with this covenant and all other covenants at july  with a tangible net worth of approximately  as of july   we had no direct borrowings or off balance sheet arrangements 
the company expects to spend approximately  after july  to complete the construction of our new shanghai  china facility 
impact of investigation regarding our danish subsidiary we are investigating transactions involving our danish subsidiary  bk medical  and certain of its foreign distributors  with respect to which we have raised questions concerning compliance with law  including danish law and the united states foreign corrupt practices act  and our business policies 
these have included transactions in which the distributors paid bk medical amounts in excess of amounts owed and bk medical transferred the excess amounts  at the direction of the distributors  to third parties identified by the distributors 
we have been unable to ascertain with certainty the ultimate beneficiaries or the purpose of these transfers 
we have voluntarily disclosed this matter to the danish government  the united states department of justice and the securities and exchange commission 
we have concluded that the transactions identified to date have been properly accounted for in our reported financial statements in all material respects 
we have terminated the employment of certain bk medical employees that were involved in the transactions 
we have decided to wind down our relationship with certain of the bk medical distributors  and are evaluating our relationship with certain other of the bk medical distributors  that were involved in the transactions 
replacing these employees and distributors could have an adverse impact on bk medical s distributor sales until their replacements are in place and productive 
revenue from sales to the bk medical distributors with whom we have decided to wind down our relationship represented less than of our total fiscal year revenue 
revenue from sales to the bk medical distributors that were involved in the identified transactions  including those distributors with whom we have decided to wind down our relationship  represented approximately of our total fiscal year revenue 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements recently adopted special purpose entities in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance that eliminates the concept of a qualified special purpose entity and related guidance  creates more stringent conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale  clarifies other sale accounting criteria  and changes the initial measurement of a transferor s interest in transferred financial assets 
this guidance was effective for us on august  and did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued guidance that requires former qualified special purpose entities to be evaluated for consolidation  changes the approach to determining a variable interest entity s vie primary beneficiary  and requires companies to more frequently reassess whether they must consolidate vies 
this guidance was effective for us on august  and did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
revenue recognition in march  the fasb issued guidance related to revenue recognition that applies to arrangements with milestones relating to research or development deliverables 
this guidance provides criteria that must be met to recognize consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a substantive milestone in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
this guidance was effective for us on august  and did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
not yet effective impairment testing in december  the fasb issued an amendment to the guidance on goodwill impairment testing 
the amendment modifies step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in making that determination  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
this guidance is effective for us on august  and it is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
business combinations and noncontrolling interests in december  the fasb issued guidance specifying that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity acquirer should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
it also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
this guidance is effective for us prospectively for material business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after august  fair value measurements in may  the fasb issued an update to the accounting on fair value measurement to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
this update changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
this update does not extend the use of fair value accounting  but provides guidance on how it should be applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards within us gaap or ifrs 
this update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  and is applied prospectively 
early adoption is prohibited 
this guidance is effective for us on august  and we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  of this new accounting update on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 

table of contents presentation of comprehensive income in june  the fasb issued an update to the accounting on comprehensive income to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income and to facilitate convergence of us gaap and ifrs 
this update requires that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this update does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
further  this update does not affect how earnings per share is calculated or presented 
this update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  and is applied retrospectively 
early adoption is permitted 
this guidance is effective for us on august  and it is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our most critical accounting policies  and the estimates involved in their application  have a significant impact on the preparation of these consolidated financial statements 
these policies involve significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expense  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continue to evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
by their nature  the policies discussed below require management to make its most difficult and subjective estimates and judgments  often on matters that are inherently uncertain 
our estimates and judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies  see note  summary of business operations and significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item  exhibits and financial statements schedule  of this annual report on form k 
we believe the following accounting policies require management to make the most difficult estimates and judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and accordingly are critical to an understanding of our financial statements 
revenue recognition policy we provide engineering services to some of our customers on a contractual basis and generally recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method 
we generally estimate the progress towards completion on contracts with a fixed fee arrangement on a monthly basis utilizing costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs at completion of the project or on a milestone basis based on contractual terms  as appropriate 
when total cost estimates exceed revenues  we accrue for the estimated losses immediately 
judgments and uncertainties our revenue recognition accounting methodology for engineering services with a fixed fee arrangement involves uncertainties because it requires management to make estimates of our total estimated costs at completion of projects 
the timing of when revenue  profits  and loss reserves are recognized may fluctuate if changes to the estimates of costs at completion of projects are needed 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to determine our estimated costs at completion of projects during the past three fiscal years 
if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
allocation of consideration in multiple element revenue arrangements policy we allocate arrangement consideration to each deliverable in an arrangement based on its relative selling price 
we determine selling price using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  if it exists  
table of contents and otherwise third party evidence tpe 
if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a unit of accounting  we use estimated selling price esp 
we generally expect that we will not be able to establish tpe due to the nature of the markets in which we compete  and  as such  we typically will determine selling price using vsoe or if not available  esp 
if we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe  and the order was received or materially modified after july   we use esp in the allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would transact if the product or service were sold by us on a standalone basis 
judgments and uncertainties our determination of esp involves a weighting of several factors based on the specific facts and circumstances of the arrangement 
specifically  we will consider the cost to produce the deliverable  the anticipated margin on that deliverable  the selling price and profit margin for similar parts  our ongoing pricing strategy and policies as evident in the price list as established and updated on a regular basis  the value of any enhancements that have been built into the deliverable and the characteristics of the varying markets in which the deliverable is sold 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions there is limited risk that changes in assumptions would result in a material impact to the reported financial results as these arrangements are not significant to the company 
inventory reserves policy we value our inventory at the lower of the cost of the inventory or fair market value through the establishment of inventory reserves 
management assesses the recoverability of inventory based on types and levels of inventory held  product life cycles  and changes in technology 
a variety of methodologies are used to determine the amount of inventory reserves necessary for excess and obsolete inventory 
reserves are based upon the age of the inventory  lower of cost or market  along with significant management judgments concerning future demands for the inventory 
if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates  or we experience a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  additional reserves for existing inventories might be recorded in future periods 
once recorded  inventory valuation reserves are not subsequently reversed until the inventory is used or disposed of 
judgments and uncertainties our inventory reserves involve uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging  forecasted customer demand  and technological obsolescence 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to establish our inventory reserves during the past three fiscal years 
if estimates regarding customer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to losses that could be material 
a difference in our actual reserves at july   would have affected net earnings by approximately in fiscal year share based compensation policy we have share based compensation plans  which include stock options and unvested restricted stock awards  and an employee stock purchase plan 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes valuation model and the fair value of the company s restricted stock awards  which include shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units  based on the quoted market price of its common stock or the use of a monte carlo simulation model 
we recognize the associated share based compensation expense for time based awards on a straight line basis over the vesting periods of the awards  net of estimated forfeitures 
forfeiture rates are estimated based on historical pre vesting forfeitures and are updated on the vesting dates to reflect actual forfeitures 
the amount of share based compensation expense for performance based unvested restricted stock awards that 
table of contents is recognized on a straight line basis over the performance period is based upon the number of shares that management ultimately expects to vest 
for performance based awards with an earnings per share related target  management evaluates the probability of meeting the performance criteria at each balance sheet date by looking at projected non gaap earnings per share for future periods part of the plan and related compensation cost is amortized over the performance period on a straight line basis because such awards vest only at the end of the measurement period 
changes to the probability assessment and the estimate of shares expected to vest will result in adjustments to the related share based compensation expense that will be recorded in the period of the change 
if the performance is not achieved  no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed 
for performance based awards with a market condition related target  related compensation cost is amortized over the performance period on a straight line basis  net of estimated forfeitures  regardless of whether the awards are ultimately earned 
judgments and uncertainties option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price  expected dividend yield  future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors 
performance based non vested restricted stock awards require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving company or personal performance goals 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate and the amount of compensation expense we recognize 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to determine our share based compensation expense during the past three fiscal years 
if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  particularly those used in determining the accrual percentage for performance based non vested restricted stock awards  we may be exposed to changes in share based compensation expense that could be material 
a change in our share based compensation expense for the year ended july   would have affected net earnings by approximately in fiscal year warranty reserves policy we estimate the costs of product warranties based on specific warranty claims  historical data  and engineering estimates  where applicable 
judgments and uncertainties our warranty reserve involves uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions based on specific warranty claims  historical data  and engineering estimates  where applicable 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to establish our warranty reserves during the past three fiscal years 
if actual product failure rates or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
such revisions could adversely affect our operating results 
a change in our warranty reserve at july   would have affected net earnings by approximately in fiscal year purchase price allocation for business combinations policy we apply the purchase accounting method to account for business combinations  which requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to assign the purchase price to the fair value of the assets and liabilities purchased  with the excess value  if any  being classified as goodwill 
for those assets with finite lives  useful lives are assigned to those intangibles and their values are amortized over their remaining life 
judgments and uncertainties our purchase price allocation methodology involves uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired 
table of contents assets and liabilities 
management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses 
unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates  including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  impairment charges could result on intangible assets or goodwill 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets policy we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable 
we conduct our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses  which consider both the market approach and income approach for goodwill and the relief from royalty approach for the indefinite lived intangible assets 
under the market approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on trading and acquisition multiples 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
under the relief from royalty approach  the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is based on after tax royalty rate and discount rate applied to future forecasted sales 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets using the methodologies described herein  and determined there was no impairment 
the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets related to acquisitions at july  were  and  respectively 
judgments and uncertainties the valuation analyses described above involve uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as our future expectations 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 
a change in our calculation of our reporting units fair value at december  would still yield a fair value of our reporting units in excess of the carrying value of our reporting units assets 
income tax contingencies policy our income tax returns  like those of most companies  are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities 
these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
at any one time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities 
in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions  we record a liability for exposures subject to a minimum threshold of more likely than not before any benefit is recognized 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established a liability  is audited and fully resolved or clarified 
we adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provision in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled  the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 
judgments and uncertainties our liability for unrecognized tax benefits involves uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

table of contents to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability  the effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
deferred tax valuation allowances policy we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions within which we operate 
this process involves assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that recovery is not more than likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
to the extent a valuation allowance is established  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
judgments and uncertainties our effective income tax rate is affected by changes in tax law  the tax jurisdiction of new business ventures  the level of earnings  and the results of tax audits 
our deferred tax valuation allowances involve uncertainties because the calculations require management to make assumptions based on historical data  future book income  and tax planning strategies 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to establish our deferred tax asset valuation allowances during the past three fiscal years 
in the event that actual results differ from the estimates and assumptions we use in determining our effective tax rate  the provision for income taxes and results of operations could be materially impacted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all dollar amounts in this item a are in thousands 
certain of our foreign operations enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency  primarily the us dollar and the euro 
we also have foreign currency exposure arising from the translation of our net equity investment in our foreign operations to us dollars 
we generally view our investments in foreign operations with functional currencies other than the us dollar as long term 
the currencies to which we are exposed are the british pound  chinese yuan  canadian dollar  danish kroner  euro  and japanese yen 
a depreciation in the july  and functional currencies  relative to the us dollar  would result in a reduction of stockholders equity of approximately  and  respectively 
we place our cash investments in high quality financial instruments and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution 
our cash and investments include cash equivalents  which we consider to be investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less 
investments having original maturities in excess of three months are stated at amortized cost  which approximates fair value  and are classified as held to maturity 
total interest income for fiscal year was a change in interest income would not have a material impact on the fair value of our portfolio or on future earnings
