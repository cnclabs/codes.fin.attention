item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  and for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   and also a discussion of our financial condition as of december  this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included in this annual report on form k 
the financial measures that we believe are most meaningful in analyzing our performance and assessing whether we are achieving our objectives are growth in book value per share  net operating income  combined ratio  return on average shareholders equity and net operating return on average shareholders equity 
the table below shows the key performance indicators as of december  and and for the years ended december   and as of december  as of december  book value per share diluted book value per share year ended december  in millions of us dollars net operating income combined ratio return on average shareholders equity net operating return on average shareholders equity book value per share is calculated as shareholders equity divided by the number of common shares outstanding 
diluted book value per share is calculated as shareholders equity divided by the number of diluted common shares outstanding using the treasury stock method 
net operating income and net operating return on average shareholders equity are non gaap financial measures as defined by sec regulation g 
see non gaap financial measures for reconciliation to the nearest us gaap financial measure 
combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio  the acquisition cost ratio and the general and administrative expense ratio for the property and casualty business 
return on average shareholders equity and net operating return on average shareholders equity are calculated by dividing net income and net operating income  respectively  by average shareholders equity determined using the average of the quarterly average shareholders equity balances for the year 
we consider growth in book value per share to be the most important financial performance measure in assessing whether we are meeting our business objectives 
during the year ended december   we distributed per share in cash to our shareholders  which provided tangible value to shareholders and reduced our excess capital 
we believe that a comparison of book value per share and diluted book value per share from december  to december  should be adjusted for these distributions to fully reflect the return generated for shareholders 
adding back per share to our december  diluted book value per share of would result in per share  an increase of over december  the increase in diluted book value per share  as adjusted  was principally due to a combination of operating results  unrealized gains on our investment portfolio and the repurchase of our shares at a discount to diluted book value per share 
the year ended december  is the first year in which the results of operations of the former harbor point companies are included in our financial results 
this contributed to an increase in net operating income for 
table of contents the year ended december  as the results of operations of the former harbor point companies are included in our financial results for the period from may  to december  and are not reflected in our financial results for the prior year 
this also had a favorable impact on our combined ratio for the year as there were few significant property catastrophe losses affecting the harbor point portfolio of contracts during the period from may  to december  our combined ratio decreased in the year ended december  primarily as a result of the addition of the harbor point portfolio of contracts to our business mix 
losses incurred from the new zealand earthquake  deepwater horizon oil spill  chilean earthquake  european windstorm xynthia  australian hailstorms and australian floods during the year were within our risk tolerances 
the property catastrophe and significant per risk losses experienced during the year ended december  represented less than of our shareholders equity as of december  given the multi billion dollar estimated industry losses from these combined events  we believe these results demonstrate the effectiveness of our conservative underwriting strategy and our product line and geographic diversification 
we continued to actively manage our capital during the year 
we spent million to repurchase million shares during the year at an average price of per share  a discount to our december  diluted book value per share 
as long as the market price of our shares trades below book value per share  we expect to continue to consider share repurchases as an effective tool to manage capital in a soft cycle and to increase book value per share for our shareholders 
we also took advantage of favorable market conditions in to issue million of long term debt due in at a fixed rate of interest of  which replaced our variable rate million revolving short term borrowing and provided funds for general corporate purposes 
over the long term  we believe the issuance of these notes and reduction of short term borrowing will be accretive to our return on shareholders equity by lowering our weighted average cost of capital and will provide us greater capital flexibility 
during the year ended december   our return on average shareholders equity and our net operating return on average shareholders equity decreased compared to the prior year primarily due the combination of lower returns on our investments  in particular in our hedge fund portfolio  and the increased shareholders equity resulting from the amalgamation 
following the amalgamation we had capital in excess of the amount we consider to be necessary to execute our business plan 
this excess capital decreased our return on average shareholders equity for the period after the amalgamation 
since closing of the amalgamation  we have reduced our excess capital through dividends and share repurchases 
in prior years  we targeted a long term net operating return on average shareholders equity of the over the cycle 
commencing in  we will target a long term net operating return on average shareholders equity of the risk free rate plus over the cycle  which we believe more accurately reflects current investment yields 
the markets in which we operate historically have been cyclical 
during periods of excess underwriting capacity  competition can result in lower pricing and less favorable policy terms 
during periods of reduced underwriting capacity  pricing and policy terms are generally more favorable for insurers and reinsurers 
we are currently in a period of excess underwriting capacity with soft pricing and deteriorating policy terms 
as a result  our premium volumes in most of our lines of business after adjusting for the harbor point premiums that are included in s results of operations but are not included in s results of operations have decreased 
in addition  we are operating in a low interest rate environment  which has decreased our investment income 
both of these factors generally result in lower net operating income  return on average shareholders equity and net operating return on average shareholders equity 
there are no indications that the pricing or investment environment in will be substantially different than to meet these challenges  we intend to maintain our underwriting discipline while actively managing our expenses 
as a result  our gross written premiums for the year ending december  will likely decrease 
table of contents relative to the year ended december   on a pro forma basis 
in  we intend to emphasize our short tail lines of business more than our long tail casualty lines of business  and we expect that our new business initiatives will be weighted more to insurance instead of reinsurance 
within our life and annuity reinsurance segment  we have not been able to identify many meaningful opportunities to write new life and annuity reinsurance contracts where we can earn an attractive investment spread 
as a result  we have determined not to write any new life and annuity reinsurance contracts in the foreseeable future 
drivers of profitability revenues we derive operating revenues from premiums from our insurance and reinsurance businesses 
additionally  we recognize returns from our investment portfolios 
insurance and reinsurance premiums are a function of the amount and type of contracts written as well as prevailing market prices 
property and casualty premiums are earned over the terms of the underlying coverage 
life and annuity reinsurance premiums are generally earned when the premium is due from policyholders 
each of our insurance and reinsurance contracts contain different pricing  terms and conditions and expected profit margins 
therefore  the amount of premiums is not necessarily an accurate indicator of our anticipated profitability 
premium estimates are based upon information in underlying contracts  data received from clients and from premium audits 
changes in premium estimates are expected and may result in significant adjustments in any period 
these estimates change over time as additional information regarding the underlying business volume of our clients is obtained 
there is often a delay in the receipt of updated premium information from clients due to the time lag in preparing and reporting the data to us 
after review by our underwriters and finance staff  we increase or decrease premium estimates as updated information from our clients is received 
our net investment income is a function of the average invested assets and the average yield that we earn on those invested assets 
the investment yield on our fixed maturities investments is a function of market interest rates as well as the credit quality and maturity of our fixed maturities portfolio 
our net realized and unrealized gains or losses on investments includes realized capital gains or losses on our fixed maturity securities and changes in fair value of our trading securities and other investments 
we recognize the realized capital gains or losses at the time of sale  and they  along with the change in fair value of our trading securities  reflect the results of changing market values and conditions  including changes in market interest rates and changes in the market s perception of the credit quality of our fixed maturities holdings 
the change in fair value of other investments is a function of the success of the funds in which we are invested  which depends on  among other things  the underlying strategies of the funds  the ability of the fund managers to execute the fund strategies  general economic and investment market conditions 
expenses our principal expenses are losses and benefits  acquisition costs  interest expense and general and administrative expenses 
losses and benefits are based on the amount and type of insurance and reinsurance contracts written by us during the current reporting period and information received during the current reporting period from clients pertaining to contracts written in prior years 
we record losses and benefits based on actuarial estimates of the expected losses and benefits to be incurred on each contract written 
the ultimate losses and benefits depend on the actual costs to settle these liabilities 
we increase or decrease losses and benefits estimates as actual claim reports are received 
our ability to make reasonable estimates of losses and benefits at the time of pricing our contracts is a critical factor in determining profitability 
acquisition costs consist principally of ceding commissions paid to ceding clients and brokerage expenses 
these typically represent a negotiated percentage of the premiums on insurance and reinsurance contracts 
table of contents written 
acquisition costs are stated net of ceding commissions associated with premiums ceded to our quota share partners on our insurance and reinsurance business 
these ceding commissions are designed to compensate us for the costs of producing the portfolio of risks ceded to our reinsurers 
we defer and amortize these costs over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
interest expense principally reflects interest on any bank loans and interest on our senior notes 
interest expense also includes the net interest charge on funds withheld from reinsurers under reinsurance and retrocessional contracts 
interest expense on funds withheld from other reinsurers under reinsurance and retrocessional contracts will vary principally due to changes in the balance of funds withheld 
in addition  interest expense also includes interest on deposit contracts 
general and administrative expenses are principally employee salaries  bonuses and related personnel costs  office rent  amortization of leasehold improvements  information technology expenditure and other operating costs 
these costs generally do not vary with the amount of premiums written 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap  which require management to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
reserve for property and casualty losses and life and annuity reinsurance benefit reserves the liability for property and casualty losses is the largest and most complex estimate in our consolidated balance sheet 
the liability for losses  including loss adjustment expenses  represents estimates of the ultimate cost of all losses incurred but not paid as of the balance sheet date 
in estimating reserves we utilize a variety of standard actuarial methods 
although these actuarial methods have been developed over time  assumptions about anticipated size of loss and loss emergence patterns are subject to fluctuations 
newly reported loss information from clients or insured is the principal contributor to changes in our loss reserve estimates 
these estimates  which generally involve actuarial projections  are based upon an assessment of known facts and circumstances  as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency and judicial theories of liability factors  including the actions of third parties  which are beyond our control 
we rely on data reported by clients when calculating reserves 
the quality of the data varies from client to client 
on a periodic basis the clients loss data is analyzed by our actuarial and claims management teams to ascertain its quality and credibility 
this process may involve comparisons with submission data and industry loss data  claims audits and inquiries about the methods of establishing case reserves associated with large industry events 
when determining reserves we also consider historical data  industry loss trends  legal developments  changes in social attitudes and economic conditions  including the effects of inflation 
we believe that the provision for outstanding losses and benefits will be adequate to cover the ultimate net cost of losses incurred to the balance sheet date  but the provision is necessarily an estimate and could potentially be settled for a significantly greater or lesser amount 
these estimates are reviewed regularly and any adjustments to the estimates are recorded in the period they are determined 
consistent with industry practice  in estimating reserves we utilize a variety of standard actuarial methods together with management judgment 
the loss reserve selection from these methods is based on the loss development characteristics of the specific line of business and contracts  which take into consideration coverage terms  type of business  maturity of loss data  reported claims and paid claims 
we do not necessarily utilize the same actuarial method or group of actuarial methods for all contracts within a line of business or segment as 
table of contents variations between contracts result in a number of different methods or groups of methods being appropriate 
these actuarial methods have been designed to address the lag in loss reporting in the insurance industry as well as the delay in obtaining information that would allow us to more accurately estimate future payments 
there is often a time lag between reinsurance clients establishing case reserves and re estimating their reserves  and notifying us of the new or revised case reserves 
reporting lag is more pronounced in our reinsurance contracts than in our insurance contracts due to the reliance on insurers to report their claims to us 
casualty business generally has a longer reporting lag and payment pattern than property business 
on casualty reinsurance transactions the reporting lag will generally be to days after the end of a reporting period  but can be longer than this in some cases 
based on the experience of our actuaries and management we select loss development factors and trending techniques to mitigate the problems caused by reporting lags 
we regularly evaluate and update our loss development and trending factor selections using client specific and industry data 
the principal actuarial methods we use to perform our quarterly loss reserve analysis may include one or more of the following methods initial expected loss ratio method 
to estimate ultimate losses under the expected loss ratio method  we multiply earned premiums by an expected loss ratio 
the expected loss ratio is selected utilizing industry data  historical client data  frequency severity and rate level forecasts and professional judgment 
paid loss development method 
this method estimates ultimate losses by calculating past paid loss development factors and applying them to exposure periods with further expected paid loss development 
the paid loss development method assumes that losses are paid at a rate consistent with the historical rate of payment 
it provides an objective test of reported loss projections because paid losses contain no reserve estimates 
for many coverages  claim payments are made slowly and it may take many years for claims to be fully reported and settled 
reported loss development method 
this method estimates ultimate losses by using past reported loss development factors and applying them to exposure periods with further expected reported loss development 
since reported losses include payments and case reserves  changes in both of these amounts are incorporated in this method 
this approach provides a larger volume of data to estimate ultimate losses than paid loss methods 
thus  reported loss patterns may be less varied than paid loss patterns  especially for coverages that have historically been paid out over a long period of time but for which claims are reported relatively early and case loss reserve estimates established 
bornhuetter ferguson paid loss method 
the bornhuetter ferguson paid loss method is a combination of the paid loss development method and the expected loss ratio method 
the amount of losses yet to be paid is based upon the expected loss ratios 
this method avoids some of the distortions that could result from a large development factor being applied to a small base of paid losses to calculate ultimate losses 
this method will react slowly if actual paid loss experience develops differently than historical paid loss experience because of major changes in rate levels  retentions or deductibles  the forms and conditions of coverage  the types of risks covered or a variety of other factors 
bornhuetter ferguson reported loss method 
the bornhuetter ferguson reported loss method is similar to the bornhuetter ferguson paid loss method with the exception that it uses reported losses and reported loss development factors 
frequency severity method 
this method is based on assumptions about the number of claims that will impact a transaction and the average ultimate size of those claims 
on excess of loss contracts  reported claims in lower layers provide insight to the expected number of claims that will likely impact the upper layers 

table of contents the selection of appropriate actuarial methods to establish reserves may change over time as the underlying loss information becomes more seasoned 
additional discussion of the reserving practices by business segment is included below 
for the purposes of this discussion we consider the losses for the following lines of business to be included within property losses  agriculture  aviation  marine energy  property and other 
we consider losses for the accident health  auto  credit  excess liability  financial institutions  general casualty  international casualty  medical malpractice  professional liability  surety and whole account lines of business to be classified as casualty losses 
property and casualty losses  net of related reinsurance recoverables  are charged to income as incurred 
unpaid losses including loss adjustment expenses represent the accumulation of case reserves  which are reserves established for individual claims and as reported by our cedants in the case of reinsurance  incurred but not reported reserves which we refer to as ibnr  which include reserves for the following pure incurred but not reported claims  and future development on known claims 
the table below shows our reserves as of december  by these components and by segment 
insurance reinsurance us specialty alterra at lloyd s life and annuity in millions of us dollars case reserves ibnr total our reserving methodologies use a loss reserving model that calculates a point estimate for our ultimate losses 
although we believe that our assumptions and methodologies are reasonable  we cannot be certain that our ultimate payments will not vary  potentially materially  from the estimates we have made 
if we determine that adjustments to an earlier estimate are appropriate then those adjustments are reflected in our net income during the period in which we determine these adjustments 
the establishment of new reserves or the adjustment of reserves for reported claims could result in significant upward or downward changes to our financial condition or results of operations in any particular period 
we regularly review and update these estimates using the most current information available to us 
development of our prior period incurred losses for each of the three years ended december  is reported in note property and casualty losses and loss adjustment expenses to our consolidated financial statements 
our development of prior period loss reserves has been less than in each of the three years ending december  and an average of over the past nine years 
based on this experience  we currently believe that it is reasonably likely that loss reserves could change from currently reported amounts 
this change could be higher or lower depending on our client reported data and potential future commutation of reserves 
as of december   a change in loss reserves would impact our net income and shareholders equity by million 
depending on whether the reasonably likely adjustments to loss reserves are on contracts ceded to one of our various reinsurance arrangements  there may also be a partially offsetting change in the losses recoverable  net income and shareholders equity 
insurance loss reserve process our casualty insurance loss reserves include case reserves  an amount for ibnr reserves and loss adjustment expenses 
the reserves are compiled on a portfolio basis and are estimated on an undiscounted basis 

table of contents the majority of our insurance reserves are related to casualty business 
casualty losses are long tailed  which means that there can be a significant delay between the occurrence of a loss and the time it is settled by the insurer 
casualty losses are also more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations and a changing legal environment 
due to the long claim tail nature of casualty business  a high degree of judgment is involved in establishing loss reserves 
our property insurance loss reserves are compiled on a portfolio basis and are computed on an undiscounted basis 
these reserves are adjusted for losses reported by our clients and for our estimate of losses resulting from catastrophe events 
the reserves for catastrophe events are based on a detailed  location specific analysis of our clients properties impacted by the events 
as part of our analysis of insurance loss reserves we review loss reports received from our clients to confirm that submitted claims are covered under the contract terms and take into account industry loss activity and industry loss trends 
we also consider historical data  legal developments  changes in social attitudes and economic conditions  including the effects of inflation 
as additional data becomes available and is reviewed  we may revise our insurance reserve estimates to reflect this additional data 
this may result in increases or decreases to reserves for insured events of prior years

on casualty reinsurance transactions  the reporting lag will generally be to days after the end of a reporting period  but can be longer in some cases 
appropriate selection of loss development factors is used to mitigate these issues 
we utilize the latest information received from our clients and work to ensure that the loss data is current 
however  due to the varying quality of data from our reinsureds and the inherent reporting delays  our reinsurance reserves will have more uncertainty than our insurance reserves  where we receive loss information directly from our insureds 
when determining reserves  we also consider additional historical data  industry loss trends  legal developments  changes in social attitudes and economic conditions  including the effects of inflation 
rapidly changing economic conditions will increase the inherent uncertainty of the reserve estimates 
as additional data becomes available and is reviewed  we revise our reinsurance reserve estimates to reflect this additional data  which may result in increases or decreases to reserves for insured events of prior years

life and annuity reinsurance benefit reserve process our life and annuity reinsurance benefit and claim reserves are compiled by our life and annuity actuaries on a contract by contract basis and are computed on a discounted basis using standard actuarial techniques and cash flow models 
we establish and review our life and annuity reinsurance reserves regularly based upon cash flow projection models utilizing data provided by clients and actuarial models 
we establish and maintain our life and annuity reinsurance reserves at a level that we estimate will  when taken together with future premium payments and investment income expected to be earned on associated premiums  be sufficient to support all future cash flow benefit and third party servicing obligations as they become payable 
since the development of our life and annuity reinsurance reserves is based upon cash flow projection models  we make estimates and assumptions based on cedant experience and industry mortality tables  longevity  expense and investment experience  including a provision for adverse deviation 
the assumptions used to determine policy benefit reserves are best estimate assumptions that are determined at the inception of the contracts and are locked in throughout the life of the contract unless a premium deficiency develops 
we establish these estimates based upon transaction specific historical experience  information provided by the ceding company and industry experience studies 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
as the experience on the contracts emerges  the assumptions are reviewed by management 
we determine whether actual and anticipated experience indicates that existing policy reserves  together with the present value of future gross premiums  are sufficient to cover the present value of future benefits  settlement and maintenance costs and to recover unamortized acquisition costs 
if such a review produces reserves in excess of those currently held then the lock in assumptions are revised and an additional life and annuity benefit reserve is recognized at that time 
there have been no material reserve adjustments to our life and annuity reinsurance benefit reserves during the years ended december   and the assumptions used to determine claim reserves are best estimate assumptions and are reviewed no less than annually 
the assumptions are un locked if they result in a material reserve change 
we establish these assumptions based upon transaction specific historical experience  information provided by the ceding company and industry experience studies 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 

table of contents because of the many assumptions and estimates used in establishing reserves and the long term nature of reinsurance contracts  the reserving process  while based on actuarial science  is inherently uncertain 
valuation of investments we invest in a trading portfolio of fixed maturities securities  an available for sale portfolio of fixed maturities securities and a held to maturity portfolio of fixed maturities securities 
we record the trading and available for sale portfolios at fair value on our balance sheet 
for our trading portfolio  the unrealized gain or loss associated with the difference between the fair value and the amortized cost of the investments is recorded in net income 
for our available for sale portfolio  the unrealized gain or loss absent credit losses is recorded in other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheet 
in an effort to match the expected cash flow requirements of our long term liabilities  we invest a portion of our fixed maturity investments in long duration securities 
because we intend to hold a number of these long duration securities to maturity  we classify those securities as held to maturity in our consolidated balance sheet 
this held to maturity portfolio is recorded at amortized cost 
as a result  we do not record changes in the fair value of this portfolio  which should reduce the impact on shareholders equity of fluctuations in fair value of those investments 
we measure fair value in accordance with asc  fair value measurements 
the guidance dictates a framework for measuring fair value and a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurements 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below level quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets 
level quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets 
level model derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable 
when the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy  the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
thus  a level fair value measurement may include inputs that are observable level and and unobservable level 
the use of valuation techniques may require a significant amount of judgment 
during periods of market disruption  including periods of rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity  it may be difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent or market data becomes less observable 
fixed maturities fixed maturities are subject to fluctuations in fair value due to changes in interest rates  changes in issuer specific circumstances such as credit rating and changes in industry specific circumstances such as movements in credit spreads based on the market s perception of industry risks 
as a result of these potential fluctuations  it is possible to have significant unrealized gains or losses on a security 
our strategy for our fixed maturities portfolio is to tailor the maturities of the portfolio to the timing of expected loss and benefit payments 
at maturity  absent any credit loss  fixed maturities amortized cost will equal their fair value and no realized gain or loss will be recognized in income 
if  due to an unforeseen change in loss payment patterns  we need to sell any available for sale investments before maturity  we could realize significant gains or losses in any period  which could result in a meaningful effect on reported net income for such period 

table of contents we perform regular reviews of our available for sale and held to maturity fixed maturities portfolios and utilize a process that considers numerous indicators in order to identify investments that are showing signs of potential other than temporary impairments 
these indicators include the length of time and extent of the unrealized loss  any specific adverse conditions  historic and implied volatility of the security  failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest payments  expected cash flow analysis  significant rating changes and recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date 
the consideration of these indicators and the estimation of credit losses involve significant management judgment 
any other than temporary impairment  or otti  related to a credit loss is recognized in earnings  and the amount of the otti related to other factors eg interest rates  market conditions  etc 
is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
if no credit loss exists but either a we have the intent to sell the debt security or b it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery  the entire unrealized loss is recognized in earnings 
in periods after the recognition of an otti loss on debt securities  we account for such securities as if they had been purchased on the measurement date of the otti at an amortized cost basis equal to the previous amortized cost basis less the net impairment loss recognized in earnings 
we recognized other than temporary impairment charges through earnings of million  million and during the years ended december   and  respectively 
fair value prices for all securities in our fixed maturities portfolio are independently provided by our investment custodian  investment accounting service provider and our investment managers  which each utilize internationally recognized independent pricing services 
we record the unadjusted price provided by the investment custodian or the investment accounting service provider after an internal validation process 
our validation process includes i comparison to the price provided by the investment manager  with significant differences investigated  ii quantitative analysis eg  comparing the quarterly return for each managed portfolio to its target benchmark  with significant differences identified and investigated  iii evaluation of methodologies used by external parties to calculate fair value  and iv comparing the price to our knowledge of the current investment market 
the independent pricing services used by our investment custodian  investment accounting service provider and investment managers obtain actual transaction prices for securities that have quoted prices in active markets 
each pricing service has its own proprietary method for determining the fair value of securities that are not actively traded 
in general  these methods involve the use of matrix pricing in which the independent pricing service uses observable market inputs  including reported trades  benchmark yields  broker dealer quotes  interest rates  prepayment speeds  default rates and such other inputs as are available from market sources to determine a reasonable fair value 
in addition  pricing services use valuation models  such as an option adjusted spread model  to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios 
the option adjusted spread model is commonly used to estimate fair value for securities such as mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
the ability to obtain quoted market prices is reduced in periods of decreasing liquidity  which generally increases the use of matrix pricing methods and generally increases the uncertainty surrounding the fair value estimates 
this could result in the reclassification of a security between levels of the hierarchy 
other investments our hedge fund portfolio comprises a portfolio of limited partnership and stock investments in trading entities  or funds  which invest in a wide range of financial products 
investments in the funds are carried at fair value 
the change in fair value is included in net realized and unrealized gains on investments and recognized in net income 
the units of account that we fair value are our interests in the funds and not the underlying holdings of such funds 
thus  the inputs we use to value our investments in each of the funds may differ from the inputs used to value the underlying holdings of such funds 
these funds are stated at fair value  which ordinarily will be the most recently reported net asset value as advised by the fund manager or administrator  where the fund s underlying holdings can be in various quoted and unquoted investments 
we believe the reported net asset value 
table of contents represents the fair value market participants would apply to an interest in the fund 
the fund managers value their underlying investments at fair value in accordance with policies established by each fund  as described in each of their financial statements and offering memoranda 
based upon information provided by the fund managers  at december   we estimate that over of the underlying assets in the funds are publicly traded securities or have broker quotes available 
we have designed ongoing due diligence processes with respect to funds and their managers 
these processes are designed to assist us in assessing the quality of information provided by  or on behalf of  each fund and in determining whether such information continues to be reliable or whether further review is necessary 
certain funds do not provide full transparency of their underlying holdings  however  we obtain the audited financial statements for every fund annually  and regularly review and discuss the fund performance with the fund managers to corroborate the reasonableness of the reported net asset values 
while reported net asset value is the primary input to the review  when the net asset value is deemed not to be indicative of fair value  we may incorporate adjustments to the reported net asset value 
such adjustments may involve significant management judgment 
as of december   certain of our funds had either imposed a gate on redemptions or segregated a portion of the underlying assets into a side pocket whereby the funds are assigned to a separate memorandum capital account or designated account 
a gate refers to funds which provide for periodic redemptions  however  in accordance with the funds governing documents  have the ability to deny or delay a redemption request 
based on the review process applied by management on such funds  a reduction of million was made to the net asset values reported by the fund managers as of december  million to adjust the carrying value of the funds to our best estimate of fair value 
additional information about the fair values of our hedge fund portfolio can be found in note to our audited consolidated financial statements included herein 
fair values of our catastrophe bonds are based on dealer quotes and if available  trade prices 
our structured deposit has a fair value that is based on publicly quoted indexes 
our derivatives holdings comprise convertible bond equity call options  interest rate linked derivative instruments and foreign exchange forward contracts 
the fair value of the equity call options is determined using an option adjusted spread model  the significant inputs for which include equity prices  interest rates  and benchmark yields 
the other derivative instruments are priced based on quoted market prices for similar securities 
a review of fair value hierarchy classifications is conducted on a quarterly basis 
changes in the observability of valuation inputs may result in a reclassification for certain financial assets and liabilities 
reclassifications impacting level of the fair value hierarchy are reported as transfers in out of the level category as of the beginning of the quarter in which the reclassifications occur 
revenue recognition we follow accounting standards codification  asc  financial services insurance in determining the accounting for our insurance and reinsurance products 
assessing whether or not the contracts we write meet the conditions for risk transfer requires judgment 
the determination of risk transfer is based  in part  on the use of actuarial and pricing models and assumptions 
insurance revenue recognition our insurance premiums are recorded at the inception of each contract based upon contract terms 
the amount of minimum and or deposit premium is usually contractually documented at inception  and variances between deposit premium and final premium are generally small 
an adjustment is made to the minimum and or deposit premium if there are changes in underlying exposures insured based on information received from our clients 
premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the coverage period 

table of contents reinsurance revenue recognition our reinsurance premiums are recorded at the inception of each contract based upon contract terms and information received from ceding clients and brokers 
for excess of loss contracts  the amount of minimum and or deposit premium is usually contractually documented at inception  and variances between this premium and final premium are generally small 
an adjustment is made to the minimum and or deposit premium  when notified  if there are changes in underlying exposures insured 
for quota share or proportional reinsurance contracts  gross premiums written are normally estimated at inception based on information provided by cedants and or brokers 
we generally account for such premiums using the client s initial estimates  and then adjust them as more current information becomes available  with such adjustments recorded as premiums written in the period they are determined 
we believe that the ceding clients estimate of the volume of business they expect to cede to us usually represents the best estimate of gross premium written at the beginning of the contract 
as the contract progresses  we monitor actual premium received in conjunction with correspondence from the ceding client in order to refine our estimate 
variances from original premium estimates are normally greater for quota share contracts than excess of loss contracts 
premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the coverage period 
the net adjustments to gross premiums written as a result of changes in premium estimates for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
such adjustments are generally the result of changing market conditions experienced by our clients 
additional premiums certain contracts that we write are retrospectively rated and we are entitled to additional premium should losses exceed pre determined  contractual thresholds 
these additional premiums are based upon contractual terms and the only element of management judgment involved is with respect to the estimate of the amount of losses that we expect to be ceded to us 
additional premiums are recognized at the time loss thresholds specified in the contract are exceeded and are earned over the policy period 
changes in estimates of losses recorded on contracts with additional premium features will result in changes in additional premiums based on contractual terms 
additional premiums assumed and ceded  related net losses and the net impact on operating results for the years ended december   and are as follows s s s decrease increase in gross premiums written decrease increase in premiums ceded decrease in net losses increase in income before tax for each of the years ended december   and  additional premiums relate to contracts where the coverage period had expired 
therefore  these additional premiums  representing revisions to our initial estimate of ultimate premiums as a result of changes in the estimate of loss reserves  were fully earned since the exposure period had ended 
reinstatement premiums certain contracts we write  particularly property reinsurance contracts  provide for reinstatements of coverage 
reinstatement premiums are the premiums for the restoration of the insurance or reinsurance limit of a contract to its full amount after a loss occurrence by the insured or reinsured and principally relate to our property catastrophe reinsurance contracts 
the purpose of optional and required reinstatements is to permit the insured reinsured to reinstate the insurance coverage at a pre determined price level once a loss event has penetrated the insured layer 
in addition  required reinstatement premiums permit the insurer reinsurer to obtain additional premiums to cover the additional loss limits provided 

table of contents we accrue for reinstatement premiums resulting from losses recorded 
such accruals are based upon contractual terms and the only element of management judgment involved is with respect to the amount of losses recorded 
changes in estimates of losses recorded on contracts with reinstatement premium features will result in changes in reinstatement premiums based on contractual terms 
reinstatement premiums are recognized at the time we record losses and are earned on a pro rata basis over the coverage period 
reinstatement premiums assumed and ceded for each of the three years to december   were not material to our financial results 
life and annuity reinsurance premium our life and annuity reinsurance premiums are recorded at the inception of the contract based on actual premiums received and are fully earned at that time 
we may periodically receive additional premiums  which are recorded and earned when received 
additional premium receipts are generally infrequent and not material 
premiums receivable for quota share or proportional contracts  we are entitled to receive premium as the ceding client collects the premium under contractual reporting and payment terms  which are usually quarterly 
premiums are usually collected over a two year period on our quota share or proportional contracts 
for excess of loss contracts  premium is generally paid in contractually stipulated installments with payment terms ranging from payment at the inception of the contract to four quarterly payments 
as a result of recognizing the estimated gross premium written at the inception of the policy and collecting that premium over an extended period  we include a premium receivable asset on our balance sheet 
we actively monitor our premium receivable asset to consider whether we need an allowance for doubtful accounts 
as part of this process  we consider the credit quality of our cedants and monitor premium receipts versus expectations 
we also seek to include a right of offset in the contract terms 
since commencing our operations  premiums receivable written off have not been material and  currently  no material premiums receivable are significantly beyond their due dates or in dispute 
results of operations we monitor the performance of our underwriting operations in five segments insurance this segment offers property and casualty excess of loss capacity from our bermuda and dublin offices primarily to fortune companies 
principal lines of business include professional lines  excess liability  aviation and property 
reinsurance this segment offers property and casualty quota share and excess of loss capacity from our bermuda  bogota  buenos aires  dublin  london and united states offices to insurance companies worldwide 
the underwriting activities of the former harbor point companies  specifically alterra re  alterra re usa and alterra re uk  are included within the reinsurance segment for the period from may  principal lines of business include agriculture  auto  aviation  credit surety  general casualty  marine energy  medical malpractice  professional liability  property  whole account and workers compensation 
us specialty this segment offers property and casualty insurance coverage from offices in the united states primarily to small to medium sized companies 
principal lines of business include general liability  inland marine  ocean marine  professional liability and property 
alterra at lloyd s this segment offers property and casualty quota share and excess of loss insurance and reinsurance from our london and copenhagen offices  primarily to medium to large sized international clients 
it also provides reinsurance to clients in latin america  operating locally in rio de janeiro  brazil  using lloyd s admitted status 
this segment comprises our proportionate share of the underwriting results of the syndicates  and the results of our managing agent  alterra at lloyd s 
the syndicates underwrite a diverse portfolio of specialty risks  including accident health  aviation  financial institutions  international casualty  professional liability  property and surety 

table of contents life and annuity reinsurance this segment operates from our bermuda office and offers reinsurance products focusing on existing blocks of life and annuity business  which take the form of co insurance transactions whereby the risks are reinsured on the same basis as the original policies 
we have determined not to write any new life and annuity contracts in the foreseeable future 
we also have a corporate function that includes our investment and financing activities 
invested assets relating to the insurance  reinsurance other than those invested assets of the us companies within the reinsurance segment and life and annuity reinsurance segments are managed on an aggregated basis 
consequently  investment income on this consolidated portfolio and gains on other investments are not directly reflected in any one of these segments 
however  because of the longer duration of liabilities on casualty insurance and reinsurance business as compared to property  and life and annuity reinsurance business  investment returns are important in evaluating the profitability of these segments 
accordingly  we allocate investment returns from the consolidated portfolio to each of these three segments 
the allocation is based on a notional allocation of invested assets from the consolidated portfolio using durations that are determined based on estimated cash flows for each segment 
the balance of investment returns from this consolidated portfolio is allocated to the corporate function for the purposes of segment reporting 
the us specialty segment  alterra at lloyd s segment and the us companies within the reinsurance segment have their own portfolio of fixed maturities investments 
as a result  the investment income earned by each of these portfolios is reported in its respective segment 
these portfolios  however  are managed on a consolidated basis together with the invested assets of the insurance  reinsurance and life and annuity segments 
net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains on investments are discussed within the investing activities section of this report and not within the segment sections of this report

premiums 
gross premiums written for the year ended december  increased by compared to the prior year 
our reinsurance segment was impacted in by the addition of premiums written by the former harbor point companies 
gross premiums written also increased in our us specialty and alterra at lloyd s segments as a result of our new product offerings  the addition of new underwriting teams  and our expansion into latin america 
these increases  and those resulting from the amalgamation  were principally offset by decreases in the level of premiums written in our insurance  reinsurance excluding harbor point and life and annuity reinsurance segments 
the lower premium volume in our insurance and reinsurance segments reflect 
table of contents expected reductions across several lines of business due to competitive market conditions  resulting in reduced writings because pricing did not meet our risk return thresholds 
the decrease in our life and annuity segment is principally due to no new contracts being written in this segment during the year ended december   compared to one contract written in the year ended december  we have determined not to write any new life and annuity contracts in the foreseeable future 
the inclusion of premiums written by the former harbor point companies does not necessarily represent new business growth  since our results of operations did not include the results of operations of the former harbor point companies 
on a pro forma basis  gross premiums written and net premiums earned for the year ended december  and would have been as follows change in millions of us dollars gross premiums written net premiums earned the above pro forma financial information for the years ended december  and is provided  for informational purposes only  to present a summary of the combined gross premiums written and net premiums earned of the company and the former harbor point companies assuming the amalgamation occurred on january  and january   respectively 
on a pro forma basis  the gross premiums written for the year ended december  would have decreased by 
this decrease would have principally been driven by lower premium volumes in our insurance and reinsurance segments  along with a decrease in our life and annuity reinsurance segment 
a discussion of pro forma reinsurance segment results including harbor point in the comparative figures is included in the section entitled reinsurance segment on a pro forma basis 
gross premiums written for the year ended december  increased by compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to growth across all of our property and casualty segments 
a significant proportion of this growth came from our alterra at lloyd s segment  which was acquired as an ongoing operation in november the property and casualty premium growth was partially offset by a decrease in gross premiums written in our life and annuity reinsurance segment 
the ratio of reinsurance premiums ceded to gross premiums written for the year ended december  was compared to and for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the decrease was principally due to the inclusion of the former harbor point business from may  at a lower ratio of ceded to written premiums  and the cancellation of a significant property quota share treaty in our us specialty segment 
the cancellation of the property quota share treaty in our us specialty segment reduced reinsurance premiums ceded by million 
we intend to gradually retain more risk in this segment  particularly in the lines of business we expect to have the greatest long term potential 
the amount of net premiums earned is a function of the earning of gross premiums written and reinsurance premiums ceded over the last several quarters and  therefore  net premiums earned generally lag quarterly increases and decreases in gross premiums written and reinsurance premiums ceded 
as a result  net premiums earned tend to be less volatile than gross premiums written and reinsurance premiums ceded 
the increase in net premiums earned for the year ended december  compared to the years ended december  and december  was principally due to the incremental earnings of the former harbor point portfolio of contracts written before the amalgamation  which are included in the year but have no equivalent in the comparable and years 
on a pro forma basis  net premiums earned in the year ended december  would have been consistent with net premiums earned for the year ended december  net investment income 
net investment income for the year ended december  increased by  compared to the year ended december  the increase was principally attributable to the increase in cash and invested assets as a result of the amalgamation  and additional investment income generated by reinvesting 
table of contents cash into fixed maturity securities 
our average investment yield was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  our ratio of average cash to average invested assets decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  as we redeployed cash into fixed maturity investments and paid a special dividend 
as the yields available in the current fixed maturity market are generally lower than the average yield on our existing portfolio the yield on our portfolio has decreased 
to date  this reduction has been partially offset by our allocation of more cash into fixed maturities  which has moderated the decrease in yield compared to prior periods 
however  due to the continuing low yield market environment  we expect continued downwards pressure on our investment yield 
net investment income for the year ended december  decreased by compared to the year ended december  the decrease was principally due to an increase in the ratio of average cash to average invested assets during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase in cash was principally due to significant cash redemptions received from our hedge fund portfolio  increased gross premiums written  and a desire to maintain high levels of liquidity  partially offset by the repayment of debt 
net realized and unrealized gains losses on investments 
net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments decreased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the principal components of the decrease were hedge fund and derivative returns 
investment gains from hedge funds decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to the year 
also  contributing to this decrease was a million loss on an interest rate forward transaction entered into in the second quarter of in contemplation of a possible long term debt issuance 
net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments was a gain of million for the year ended december  compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  this change was principally driven by net losses on the hedge fund portfolio of million in compared to net gains of million in net losses and loss expense  and claims and policy benefits 
the loss ratio decreased by percentage points for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  significant items impacting the loss ratio were net favorable loss development of prior year reserves  excluding the effect of premium adjustments  for the year ended december  of million compared to million for the year ended december   net favorable loss development for the year ended december  was principally the result of net favorable development in our workers compensation  property  general casualty  professional liability and whole account lines of business  partially offset by net unfavorable development on marine energy lines  compared to net favorable development on professional liability  property and general casualty lines offset by net unfavorable development on marine energy lines in the year ended december   excluding the net favorable loss development  the loss ratio was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the loss ratio for the year ended december  compared to the prior year was principally due to the inclusion of net premiums earned from harbor point since may  at a significantly lower loss ratio  which reduced the average loss ratio despite the increase in property catastrophe losses discussed below 
the loss ratio for the year ended december  on the net premiums earned related to the harbor point portfolio of contracts does not include any significant property catastrophe losses other than from the new zealand earthquake as most of the significant property catastrophe loss events occurred prior to the amalgamation  
table of contents also contributing to the decrease in the loss ratio  the year ended december  benefitted from the million amortization of the fair value adjustment made to acquired harbor point net loss reserves at the date of the amalgamation 
this fair value adjustment is being amortized over a weighted average period of years  and the decrease in loss ratio described above was partially offset by an increase in net losses related to property catastrophe events and significant per risk losses 
for the year ended december   our results included net losses of million related to property catastrophe events and significant per risk losses 
for the year ended december   our results included net losses of million for such events 
the loss ratio decreased by percentage points for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  significant items impacting the loss ratio were net favorable loss development of prior year reserves  excluding the effect of premium adjustments  for the year ended december  of million compared to million for the year ended december  the net favorable loss development for the year ended december  was principally the result of net favorable development in our workers compensation  property and general casualty lines of business  partially offset by net unfavorable development on professional liability and marine energy lines  compared to net favorable development on professional liability  property and general casualty lines offset by net unfavorable development on marine energy lines in the year ended december   and excluding the net favorable loss development  the loss ratio was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the loss ratio for the year ended december  compared to the prior year period was principally due to lower property catastrophe events and significant per risk losses 
for the year ended december   our results included net losses of million related to property catastrophe events and significant per risk losses 
for the year ended december   our results included net losses of million for such events 
claims and policy benefits decreased for the year ended december  compared to both the year ended december  and the year ended december  this was due to the decline over the three year period in the number of new life and annuity reinsurance contracts written 
there were no new life and annuity reinsurance contracts written in the year ended december   and three and six contracts written in the years ended december  and  respectively 
in our life and annuity reinsurance segment  we have not recently seen many meaningful opportunities to write new life and annuity reinsurance contracts where we can earn an attractive investment spread 
as a result  we have determined not to write any new life and annuity reinsurance contracts in the foreseeable future 
acquisition costs 
our acquisition cost ratio for the year ended december  increased by percentage points compared to the year ended december  the ratio for the year ended december  increased by percentage points compared to the year ended december  the insurance and reinsurance contracts we write have a wide range of acquisition cost ratios 
changes in the mix of business written and earned changes our acquisition cost ratio from year to year 
the increase in the acquisition cost ratio for the year ended december  was principally due to changes in the mix of business written  partially influenced by the additional net premiums earned from the former harbor point companies 
the harbor point portfolio of contracts contains a higher proportion of quota share contracts  which generally carry higher acquisition cost ratios than excess of loss contracts 
also contributing to the increase in the ratio for was the decrease in the level of reinsurance purchased across all of our segments  but in particular our us specialty segment 
as we have retained more business in our segments  we have received less ceding commission income to offset our brokerage and commission costs  which increases our acquisition cost ratio 

table of contents the increase in the acquisition cost ratio for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was principally due to changes in the mix of business written 
interest expense 
interest expense reflects interest on funds withheld from reinsurers  and interest on our senior notes and bank loans outstanding 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased by million compared to the year ended december  principally due to an increase in funds withheld interest for one of our largest reinsurers and an increase in senior notes outstanding as a result of the issuance of senior notes in september interest expense for the year ended december  decreased by million compared to the year ended december  this decrease was principally attributable to the repayment of million in bank loans in april and the million repayment of a swap loan in august net foreign exchange gains and losses 
net foreign exchange gains for the year ended december  were million  compared to million of gains for the year ended december  and million of losses for the year ended december  net foreign exchange gains in and principally arose on the timing of transactions in euros and british pounds and the movement of the us dollar relative to those currencies 
the loss in arose in connection with the purchase of alterra capital uk 
we purchased british pounds in advance of the acquisition of alterra capital uk and before the transaction closed the value of the british pound dropped significantly relative to the us dollar 
merger and acquisition expenses 
merger and acquisition expenses for the year ended december  comprised advisory  legal and other professional fees  the acceleration of stock based compensation expense and other expenses related to the amalgamation 
these expenses were offset by the negative goodwill gain of million recognized from the amalgamation 
merger and acquisition expenses in the year ended december  comprised advisory  legal and other professional fees related to the proposed transaction with ipc holdings limited and ipc limited  which was terminated in june  offset by a million termination fee received 
merger and acquisition expenses in the year ended december  comprised advisory  legal and other professional fees related to the acquisition of alterra capital uk and the creation of our alterra at lloyd s segment 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased by million compared to the year ended december  the increase was principally related to the additional general and administration expenses of the former harbor point companies 
in addition  there was an increase in performance based compensation expense as a result of a larger cash component of the performance based compensation than in however  the corresponding increase in net earned premiums as a result of the amalgamation resulted in no change in our general and administrative expense ratio for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased by million compared to the year ended december  this increase was principally due to the improvement in the net income generated in compared to  resulting in increased performance based compensation in in addition  there was a higher level of expense related to information technology in we consider information technology to be a critical component of our business and we expect to make recurring and often significant investments in upgrading and maintaining our technology infrastructure in future years 
income tax expense 
corporate income tax expense is generated through our foreign operations in the united states and europe 
the effective tax rate was for the year ended december  compared with in the year ended december  the decrease in the effective tax rate in compared to was principally due to an increase in deferred tax benefits in our us operations in for the year ended december   we had a consolidated loss before tax but recorded income tax expense on our operations in the united states and ireland 
the effective tax rate varies between periods depending on the distribution of net income or losses among our various taxable jurisdictions

the ratio of reinsurance premiums ceded to gross premiums written for the year ended december  was  as compared to and  respectively  in the years ended december  and december  the amount of reinsurance that we purchase can vary significantly by line of business 
the decrease in the percentage of reinsurance premiums ceded is principally due to changes in the mix of business 
a contributing factor in was the reduction in property reinsurance premiums ceded to harbor point which became fully eliminated intercompany transactions after the amalgamation 
we expect to gradually replace those reinsurance premiums ceded with third parties over the course of the normal renewal periods 
the amount of net premiums earned is a function of the earning of gross premiums written and reinsurance premiums ceded over the last several quarters and  therefore  net premiums earned generally lag quarterly increases and decreases in gross premiums written and reinsurance premiums ceded

gross premiums written for the year ended december  increased compared to the year ended december  the increase in gross premiums written was primarily due to the addition of aviation business to our alterra at lloyd s segment in the fourth quarter of  which largely represents a transfer of business previously written within our insurance segment  the addition of international casualty product lines in the first quarter of  which generated million of gross premiums written in the year ended december   and the commencement of underwriting in brazil in  which generated million of gross premiums written for the year ended december   primarily in the property line of business 
the year ended december  was the first full year of operations for the alterra at lloyd s segment 
gross premiums written for the year ended december  increased compared to gross premiums written of million for the year ended december  million of which were written prior to our acquisition of alterra at lloyd s  and therefore are not included in the consolidated results for the year ended december   and million of which were written following the acquisition and are reflected in the table above 
this growth was predominantly in the property and accident health business lines 
the ratio of reinsurance premiums ceded to gross premiums written for the year ended december  was  compared to for the year ended december  the volume of reinsurance premiums ceded did not increase at the same rate as the increase in gross premiums written because a significant proportion of our reinsurance program are excess of loss non proportional contracts rather than quota share proportional contracts 
the amount of net premiums earned is a function of the earning of gross premiums written and reinsurance premiums ceded over the last several quarters and  therefore  net premiums earned generally lag quarterly increases and decreases in gross premiums written and reinsurance premiums ceded

consequently  components of our underwriting results  such as premiums written  premiums earned and benefits can be volatile and  accordingly  period to period comparisons are not necessarily representative of future trends 
our life and annuity benefit reserves are recorded on a discounted present value basis 
this discount is amortized through income as a claims and policy benefits expense over the term of the underlying policies 
as a result  income is driven by the spread between the actual rate of return on our investments and the interest discount on our reserves  together with differences between estimated and actual claims  premiums  expenses and persistency of the underlying policies 
there were no new life and annuity contracts written during the year ended december  one new reinsurance contract was written in the year ended december   accounting for most of the premiums written for that year 
three contracts totaling gross premiums written of million  each covering closed blocks of pension annuities for existing clients  were written in the year ended december  our life and annuity business was focused exclusively on acquiring policies with significant reserve balances  which allowed us to earn a profit by investing at a higher yield than the cost of funds of those reserves 
we were able to execute this strategy successfully in prior years as our investment in hedge funds constituted a significant portion of our total investments and investment yields in general were more attractive 
our investment strategy is now focused primarily on holding high quality fixed maturity securities  which makes it difficult to grow our life and annuity business profitably 
in addition  we have not been able to identify many meaningful opportunities to write new life and annuity reinsurance contracts where we can earn an attractive investment spread 
as a result  we have determined not to write any new life and annuity contracts in the foreseeable future 
this determination does not affect our existing life and annuity reinsurance contracts and we will continue to service our existing life and annuity customer base 
gross premiums written  reinsurance premiums ceded  net premiums earned  acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses represent ongoing premium receipts or adjustments and related administration expenses on existing contracts

net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains losses on investments are discussed within the investing activities section as we manage investments for this segment on a consolidated basis with our other segments 
investing activities the results of investing activities discussed below include the net investment income  net realized and unrealized gains losses on investments and net impairment losses recognized in earnings for all of our segments  including amounts that are allocated to the segments 
these investment results are presented below on a consolidated basis 

table of contents change change in millions of us dollars net investment income net realized and unrealized gains losses on investments n a net impairment losses recognized in earnings average annualized yield on cash  fixed maturities net investment income 
the increase in net investment income for the year ended december  was principally attributable to the increase in cash and invested assets as a result of the amalgamation and the issuance of senior notes together with additional investment income generated by shifting cash into higher yielding fixed maturity securities 
our ratio of average cash to average invested assets decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  as we redeployed cash into fixed maturity investments and paid a special dividend 
the yields available in the current fixed maturity market are generally lower than the average yield on our existing portfolio 
as we have invested cash generated by operations and cash generated from maturing investments into our fixed maturity portfolio  the yield on our portfolio has decreased 
to date  this reduction has been partially offset by our redeployment of a larger portion of cash into fixed maturities  helping to slow the decline in yield compared to the prior periods 
however  due to the continuing low yield market environment  we expect continued downwards pressure on our investment yield 
the decrease in net investment income for the year ended december  was principally attributable to the increase in the ratio of average cash to average invested assets for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this increase in cash was principally attributable to significant cash redemptions received from our hedge fund portfolio  growth in gross premiums written  and a desire to maintain high levels of liquidity  partially offset by the repayment of debt 
net realized and unrealized losses gains on investments include the following in millions of us dollars increase decrease in fair value of hedge funds a decrease increase in fair value of derivatives increase in fair value of catastrophe bonds increase in fair value of structured deposit income from equity method investments change in fair value of other investments net realized gains losses on available for sale securities net realized and unrealized losses gains on trading securities net realized and unrealized gains losses on investments a an increase in fair value of derivatives of million and million from a wholly owned hedge fund are included in the increase decrease in fair value of hedge funds for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
change in fair value of other investments 
our investment in hedge funds comprise the majority of other investments 
the increase in fair value of the hedge fund portfolio was million  or a rate of return  for the year ended december   compared to an increase of million  or a rate of return  for the year ended december  over the last months  we have significantly reduced our level of investment in hedge funds 
as a result  the returns generated by our hedge fund portfolio represent a decreasing proportion of our total investment income compared to previous periods 
the rate of return of for the year ended december  compares to the hfri fund of funds composite index returning over the same period  which we believe is our most relevant benchmark 

table of contents eight of the ten hedge fund strategies we employed experienced positive returns during the year ended december  the largest contributors by investment strategy to the increase in fair value for the year ended december  were the global macro and the diversified arbitrage strategies 
as of december   and of our hedge fund portfolio was allocated to the global macro and diversified arbitrage strategies  respectively 
the largest decrease in fair value offsetting the overall increase for the year was contributed by the event driven arbitrage strategy 
as of december   of our hedge fund portfolio was allocated to this strategy 
eight of the nine hedge fund strategies we employed experienced positive returns during the year ended december  the largest contributors by investment strategy to the net gain for the year ended december  were the distressed securities and the event driven arbitrage strategies 
as of december   and of our hedge fund portfolio was allocated to the distressed securities and the event driven arbitrage strategies  respectively 
all but one of the hedge fund strategies we employed experienced negative returns during the year ended december  the largest contributors by investment strategy to the loss in were the long short equity and the event driven arbitrage strategies 
as of december   and of our hedge fund portfolio was allocated to long short equity and event driven strategies  respectively 
the allocation of invested assets to our hedge fund portfolio as of december  was 
the objective of our hedge fund portfolio is to achieve a market neutral absolute return strategy  with diversification by strategy and underlying fund 
a market neutral strategy strives to generate consistent returns in both up and down markets by selecting long and short positions with a total net exposure of zero 
returns are derived from the long short spread  or the amount by which long positions outperform short positions 
the objective of an absolute return strategy is to provide stable performance regardless of market conditions  with minimal correlation to market benchmarks 
included in the change in fair value of hedge funds for the year ended december  was a million realized loss on a futures transaction that was initiated and fully settled in september this transaction was initiated as an economic hedge on a portion of our holdings of us government securities 
the fair value of derivatives decreased by million for the year ended december   and increased million for the year ended december  we did not hold any derivative instruments outside of the hedge fund portfolio as of december  we hold various derivative instruments  including convertible bond equity call options  interest rate linked derivative instruments and foreign exchange forward contracts 
during the second quarter of  we considered replacing our revolving bank loan with longer term debt 
in contemplation of this plan  we entered into two interest rate forward contracts indexed to the us treasury rate 
due to market volatility at that time  we elected not to replace our revolving bank loan and the forward contracts were settled for a loss of million in the second quarter 
at december   we had million invested in catastrophe bonds  with a par value of million  which are scheduled to mature at various dates between may  and june  the increase in fair value of the catastrophe bonds was million during the year ended december   which is included in the change in fair value of other investments 
we also hold an index linked structured deposit 
the deposit has a guaranteed minimum redemption amount of million and a scheduled redemption date of december  the increase in fair value of the structured deposit was million during the year ended december   which is included in the change in fair value of other investments 
net realized and unrealized gains and losses on available for sale and trading securities 
our total fixed maturities portfolio is split into three portfolios an available for sale portfolio  
table of contents a held to maturity portfolio  and a trading portfolio 
our available for sale portfolio is recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income as part of total shareholders equity 
our available for sale fixed maturities investment strategy is not intended to generate significant realized gains and losses as more fully discussed below in the financial condition section 
our held to maturity portfolio includes securities for which we have the ability and intent to hold to maturity or redemption  and is recorded at amortized cost 
there should be no realized gains or losses related to this portfolio unless there is an other than temporary impairment loss 
our trading portfolio is recorded at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in net income  all of which are reported within our alterra at lloyd s segment 
net realized and unrealized gains losses on our fixed maturities portfolios for the years ended december   and were million  million  and million respectively 
net impairment losses recognized in earnings 
as a result of our quarterly review of securities in an unrealized loss position  we recorded other than temporary impairment losses through earnings for the years ended december   and of million  million and million  respectively 
these impairment losses are presented separately from all other net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments 
a discussion of our process for estimating other than temporary impairments is included in note of our audited consolidated financial statements included herein 
financial condition cash and invested assets 
aggregate invested assets  comprising cash and cash equivalents  fixed maturities and other investments  were  million as of december  compared to  million as of december   an increase of 
the increase in cash and invested assets resulted principally from the amalgamation  which contributed  million in invested assets as of may   and from the issuance of senior notes in september this increase during the year ended december  was partially offset by the payment of dividends of million and the repurchase of ordinary shares of million 
our fixed maturities are recorded at fair value and are subject to fluctuations in fair value due to changes in interest rates  changes in issuer specific circumstances  such as credit rating changes  and changes in industry specific circumstances  such as movements in credit spreads based on the market s perception of industry risks 
as a result of these fluctuations  it is possible to have significant unrealized gains or losses on a security 
our strategy for our fixed maturities portfolios is to tailor the maturities of the portfolios to the timing of expected loss and benefit payments 
at maturity  absent any credit loss  a fixed maturity s amortized cost will equal its fair value and no realized gain or loss will be recognized in income 
if  due to an unforeseen change in loss payment patterns  we need to sell available for sale fixed maturity securities before maturity  we could realize significant gains or losses in any period  which could result in a meaningful effect on reported net income for such period 
in order to reduce the likelihood of needing to sell investments before maturity  especially given the unpredictable and potentially significant cash flow requirements of our property catastrophe business  we maintain significant cash and cash equivalent balances 
we believe it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell those fixed maturities securities in an unrealized loss position until such time as they reach maturity or the fair value increases 
we perform regular reviews of our fixed maturities portfolio and utilize a process that considers numerous indicators in order to identify investments that show signs of potential other than temporary impairments 
the indicators include the issuer s financial condition and ability to make future scheduled interest and principal payments  benchmark yield spreads  the nature of collateral or other credit support and significant economic events that have occurred that affect the industry in which the issuer participates 

table of contents our fixed maturity portfolio comprises high quality  liquid securities 
as of december   our fixed maturities investments had a dollar weighted average credit rating of aa aa 
under our fixed maturities investment guidelines  a minimum weighted average credit rating of aa aa  or its equivalent  must be maintained for our fixed maturities investment portfolio as a whole 
our fixed maturities investment guidelines also provide that we cannot leverage our fixed maturities investments 
further details of the credit ratings on our fixed maturities investments is included in note of our audited consolidated financial statements 
our portfolio of investment grade fixed maturities includes mortgage backed and asset backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations 
these types of securities have cash flows that are backed by the principal and interest payments of a group of underlying mortgages or other receivables 
as a result of the increasing default rates of borrowers  there is a greater risk of defaults on mortgage backed and asset backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations  especially those that are non investment grade 
these factors make the estimate of fair value more uncertain 
we obtain fair value estimates from multiple independent pricing sources in an effort to mitigate some of the uncertainty surrounding the fair value estimates 
if we need to liquidate these securities within a short period of time  the actual realized proceeds may be significantly different from the fair values estimated at december  a discussion of our process for estimating the fair value of our available for sale and trading fixed maturities investments is included in note of our audited consolidated financial statements 
we performed a review of securities in an unrealized loss position as of december  for other than temporary impairments  which included the consideration of relevant factors  including prepayment rates  subordination levels  default rates  credit ratings  weighted average life and cash flow testing 
together with our investment managers  we continue to monitor our potential exposure to mortgage backed and asset backed securities  and we will make adjustments to the investment portfolio  if and when we deem necessary 
as a result of this process  we recognized an other than temporary impairment charge through net income of million during the year ended december  a discussion of our process for estimating other than temporary impairments is included in note of our audited consolidated financial statements 
the other investments we held at december  principally comprise our investments in hedge funds  catastrophe bonds and structured deposits which are recorded at fair value 
investments in hedge funds comprise a portfolio of limited partnership and stock investments in trading entities  or funds  which invest in a wide range of financial products 
the units of account that we value are our interests in the funds and not the underlying holdings of such funds 
thus  the inputs we use to value our investments in each of the funds may differ from the inputs used to value the underlying holdings of such funds 
these funds are stated at fair value  which ordinarily will be the most recently reported net asset value as advised by the fund manager or administrator  where the fund s underlying holdings can be in various quoted and unquoted investments 
we believe the reported net asset value represents the fair value market participants would apply to an interest in the fund 
the fund managers value their underlying investments at fair value in accordance with policies established by each fund  as described in each of their financial statements and offering memoranda 
we have designed ongoing due diligence processes with respect to funds and their managers 
these processes are designed to assist us in assessing the quality of information provided by  or on behalf of  each fund and in determining whether such information continues to be reliable or whether further review is necessary 
while reported net asset value is the primary input to the review  when the net asset value is deemed not to be indicative of fair value  we may incorporate adjustments to the reported net asset value 
these adjustments may involve significant judgment 
we obtain the audited financial statements for every fund annually  and regularly review and discuss the fund performance with the fund managers to corroborate the reasonableness of the reported net asset values 

table of contents we are able to redeem our hedge fund portfolio on the same terms that the underlying funds can be liquidated 
in general  the funds in which we are invested require at least days notice of redemption  and may be redeemed on a monthly  quarterly  semi annual  annual or longer basis  depending on the fund 
certain funds in which we are invested have a lock up period 
a lock up period refers to the initial amount of time an investor is contractually required to invest before having the ability to redeem 
funds that do provide for periodic redemptions may  depending on the funds governing documents  have the ability to deny or delay a redemption request  called a gate 
the fund may implement this restriction because the aggregate amount of redemption requests as of a particular date exceeds a specified level  generally ranging from to of the fund s net assets 
the gate is a method for executing an orderly redemption process  which allows for redemption requests to be executed in a timely manner to reduce the possibility of adversely affecting the remaining investors in the fund 
the majority of our hedge fund portfolio is redeemable within one year  and the imposition of gates by certain funds is not expected to significantly impact our cash flow needs 
based upon information provided by the fund managers  as of december   we estimate that over of the underlying assets held by our hedge fund portfolio are traded securities or have broker quotes available 
typically  the imposition of a gate delays a portion of the requested redemption  with the non gated portion settled in cash shortly after the redemption date 
of our december  outstanding redemptions receivable of million  none of which are gated  million were received in cash prior to february  the fair value of our holdings in funds with gates imposed as of december  was million 
certain funds may be allowed to invest a portion of their assets in illiquid securities  such as private equity and convertible debt 
in such cases  a common mechanism used is a side pocket  whereby the illiquid security is assigned to a separate memorandum capital account or designated account 
typically  the investor loses its redemption rights to the designated account 
only when the illiquid security is sold  or otherwise deemed liquid by the fund  may investors redeem their interest 
as of december   the fair value of our hedge funds held in side pockets was million 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of the redemption of the underlying assets within funds with gates and side pockets  we have included these funds in the greater than days category in the table below 
if we requested full redemptions for all of our holdings in the funds  the tables below indicate our best estimate of the earliest date from december  on which such redemptions might be received 
this estimate is based on available information from the funds and is subject to significant change 
as of december  fair value of hedge fund portfolio in thousands of us dollars liquidity within days between to days between to days greater than days total hedge funds although we believe that our significant cash balances  fixed maturities investments and credit facilities provide sufficient liquidity to satisfy the claims of insureds and ceding clients  in the event that we were required to access assets invested in the hedge fund investment portfolio  our ability to do so may be limited by these liquidity constraints 

table of contents additional information about the hedge fund portfolio can be found in notes and to our audited consolidated financial statements included herein 
as of december   we had million invested in catastrophe bonds  with a par value of million 
we receive quarterly interest payments on the catastrophe bonds based on variable interest rates ranging from to and are scheduled to mature at various dates between may  and june  the redemption value of the bonds will adjust based on the occurrence of covered events such as windstorms and earthquakes across a number of geographic regions  including japan  europe  mexico and the united states 
the maximum possible loss to us is limited to the value of our investment 
we also hold an index linked structured deposit 
the deposit has a guaranteed minimum redemption value of million and a scheduled redemption date of december  the interest earned on the deposit is a function of the performance of the reference indices over the term of the deposit 
losses and benefits recoverable from reinsurers 
losses and benefits recoverable from reinsurers totaled million as of december  compared to  million as of december   a decrease of 
this decrease was principally due to the losses recoverable collected as part of the final settlement of a significant contract during the year  which was partially offset by additional losses ceded under our reinsurance and retrocessional agreements resulting from net earned premiums during the year ended december  losses recoverable from reinsurers on property and casualty business were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
benefits recoverable from reinsurers on life and annuity business were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
as of december   of our losses and benefits recoverable were with reinsurers rated a or above by am best company and were rated a 
grand central re  a bermuda domiciled reinsurance company in which alterra bermuda has a equity investment  is our largest nr not rated retrocessionaire and accounted for of our losses and benefits recoverable as of december  as security for outstanding loss obligations  we retain funds from grand central re amounting to of its loss recoverable obligations 
the remaining of losses and benefits recoverable were with reinsurers rated b or lower  including those not rated 
liabilities for property and casualty losses 
property and casualty losses totaled  million as of december  compared to  million as of december   an increase of 
the increase in property and casualty losses was principally attributable to the amalgamation  which resulted in an million increase in reserves 
during the year ended december   we incurred gross losses of million  we paid million in property and casualty losses  including a million settlement of a significant prior year contract  and recorded gross favorable development on prior year reserves of million 
liabilities for life and annuity benefits 
life and annuity benefits totaled  million at december  compared to  million as of december  the decrease was principally attributable to movements in foreign exchange rates 
we endeavor to match these liabilities with assets of similar currency and duration in order to limit the net impact to shareholders equity of movements in foreign exchange rates 
in addition  we paid million of benefit payments during the year ended december  senior notes 
on september   alterra finance  a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of alterra  issued million principal amount of senior notes due september  with interest payable on march and september of each year 
the senior notes are alterra finance s senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of alterra finance s future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and rank senior to all of alterra finance s future subordinated indebtedness 
the 
table of contents senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by alterra on a senior unsecured basis 
the guarantee ranks equally with all of alterra s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and ranks senior to all of alterra s future subordinated indebtedness 
the effective interest rate related to the senior notes  based on the net proceeds received  was 
the proceeds  net of all issuance costs  from the sale of the senior notes were million and were used to repay a million revolving bank loan outstanding under the harbor point credit facility  with the remainder to be used for general corporate purposes 
on april   alterra usa privately issued million principal amount of senior notes due april  with interest payable on april and october of each year 
the senior notes are alterra usa s senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness of alterra usa 
the senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by alterra 
following repurchases of million and million principal amount in december and december  respectively  the principal amount of the senior notes outstanding as of december  was million 
shareholders equity 
our shareholders equity increased to  million as of december  from  million as of december   an increase of  principally due to the amalgamation  which increased shareholders equity by  million 
in addition  we generated net income of million and a million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income for the year ended december  these increases were offset by the declaration of dividends of million and repurchases of common shares of million during the year ended december  liquidity 
we generated million of cash from operations during the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the two principal factors that impact our operating cash flow are premium collections and timing of loss and benefit payments 
in addition  during the year ended december   we settled million of reinsurance balances payable as part of the final settlement of a significant contract 
our casualty business generally has a long claim tail 
as a result  we expect that we will generate significant operating cash flow as we accumulate property and casualty loss reserves on our balance sheet 
our property business generally has a short claim tail 
consequently  we expect volatility in our operating cash flow levels as losses are incurred 
we expect increases in the amount of expected loss payments in future periods with a resulting decrease in operating cash flow  however  we do not expect loss payments to exceed the premiums generated 
actual premiums written and collected and losses and loss expenses paid in any period could vary materially from our expectations and could have a significant and adverse effect on our operating cash flows 
we tailor our fixed maturities portfolios in an effort to match the duration of expected loss and benefit payments 
we believe that our property and casualty loss reserves and life and annuity benefit reserves currently have an average duration of approximately years  which compares to an average duration of years for our fixed maturities investment portfolio 
however  increased loss amounts or settlement of losses and benefits earlier than anticipated can result in greater cash needs 
we maintain a significant working cash balance and have generated positive cash flow from operations in each of our last eight years of operating history 
we also have the ability to borrow an additional million using our current credit facilities 
our two largest credit facilities expire in june and august our cash and cash equivalents balance was million as of december  we believe that we currently maintain sufficient liquidity to cover existing requirements and provide for contingent liquidity 
nonetheless  it is possible that significant deviations in expected loss and benefit payments can occur  potentially requiring us to liquidate a portion of our fixed maturities portfolios 
if we need to liquidate our fixed maturities securities within a short period of time  the actual realized proceeds may be significantly different from the fair values estimated as of december  
table of contents as a holding company  alterra s principal asset is its investment in the common shares of its principal operating subsidiary  alterra bermuda 
alterra s principal source of funds is from interest income on cash balances and cash dividends from our subsidiaries  including alterra bermuda 
the payment of dividends by alterra bermuda is limited under bermuda law 
in particular  alterra bermuda may not declare or pay any dividends if it is in breach of its minimum solvency or liquidity levels under bermuda law or if the declaration or payment of the dividends would cause it to fail to meet the minimum solvency or liquidity levels under bermuda law

contractual obligations payment due by period in thousands of us dollars contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years senior notes operating lease obligations property and casualty losses life and annuity benefits deposit liabilities total the reserves for losses and benefits together with deposit liabilities represent management s estimate of the ultimate cost of settling losses  benefits and deposit liabilities 
as more fully discussed in critical accounting policies reserve for property and casualty losses and life and annuity reinsurance benefit reserves above  the estimation of losses and benefits is based on various complex and subjective judgments 
actual losses and benefits paid may differ  perhaps significantly  from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements 
similarly  the timing of payment of our estimated losses and benefits is not fixed and there may be significant changes in actual payment activity 
the assumptions used in estimating the likely payments due by period are based on our historical claims payment experience and industry payment patterns  but due to the inherent uncertainty in the process of estimating the timing of such payments  there is a risk that the amounts paid in any such period can be significantly different from the amounts disclosed above 
the amounts in the above table represent our gross estimates of known liabilities as of december  and do not include any allowance for claims for future events within the time period specified 
accordingly  it is highly likely that the total amounts paid out in the time periods shown will be greater than those indicated in the table 
furthermore  life and annuity benefits and deposit liabilities recorded in the audited consolidated financial statements as of december  are computed on a net present value basis  whereas the expected payments by period in the table above are the estimated payments at a future time and do not reflect a discount of the amount payable 
table of contents non gaap financial measures in this annual report on form k  we have presented net operating income and annualized net operating return on average shareholders equity  which are non gaap financial measures as defined in regulation g 
we believe that these non gaap financial measures  which may be defined differently by other companies  allow for a more complete understanding of the performance of our business 
these measures  however  should not be viewed as a substitute for those determined in accordance with us gaap

table of contents new accounting pronouncements asu  fair value measurements and disclosures improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu requires additional disclosure  and clarifies existing disclosure requirements  about fair value measurements 
the additional requirements include disclosure regarding the amounts and reasons for significant transfers in and out of level and of the fair value hierarchy and also separate presentation of purchases  sales  issuances and settlements of items measured using significant unobservable inputs ie level 
the guidance clarifies existing disclosure requirements regarding the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value for measurements that fall in either level or level of the hierarchy 
the requirements are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
the guidance has not and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

the disclosures as of the end of a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after december  the disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after december  we have adopted the requirements of this standard in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  and it has not had a material impact 
asu  financial services insurance accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts asu specifies how insurance companies should recognize costs that meet the definition of acquisition costs as defined in fasb guidance

we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we engage in an investment strategy that combines a fixed maturities investment portfolio and a hedge fund portfolio that employ strategies to manage investment risk 
we attempt to maintain adequate liquidity in our cash and fixed maturities investment portfolio to fund operations  pay insurance and reinsurance liabilities and claims and provide funding for unexpected events 
we seek to manage our credit risk through industry and issuer diversification  and interest rate risk by monitoring the duration and structure of our investment portfolio relative to the duration and structure of our liability portfolio 
we are exposed to potential loss from various market risks  primarily changes in interest rates  credit spreads and equity prices 
accordingly  our earnings would be affected by these changes 
we manage our market risk based on board approved investment policies 
with respect to our fixed maturities investment portfolio  our risk management strategy and investment policy is to invest in debt instruments of investment grade issuers and to limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to particular ratings categories and any one issuer 
we select investments with characteristics such as duration  yield  currency and liquidity that are tailored to the cash flow characteristics of our property and casualty and life and annuity liabilities 

table of contents as of december   of the securities held in our fixed maturities portfolios were rated baa bbb or above 
under our fixed maturities investment guidelines  securities in our fixed maturities portfolio  when purchased  must have a minimum credit rating of baa bbb  or its equivalent  from at least one internationally recognized statistical rating organization 
two of our investment managers managing approximately of our invested assets by fair value as of december  follow an opportunistic strategy 
this strategy includes the purchase of securities below investment grade and securities trading at deep discounts  however the opportunistic portfolios are required to have an average credit rating of b b or better 
in addition  a minimum weighted average credit quality rating of aa aa  or its equivalent  must be maintained for our fixed maturities investment portfolio as a whole 
as of december   the impact on the fixed maturities investment portfolio from an immediate basis point increase in market interest rates would have resulted in an estimated decrease in fair value of or approximately million  and the impact on the fixed maturities investment portfolio from an immediate basis point decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in an estimated increase in fair value of or approximately million 
with respect to our hedge fund portfolio  we consistently and systematically monitor the strategies and funds in which we are invested 
we focus on risk  as opposed to return  in the selection of each of our hedge fund portfolio investments 
this causes us to select individual hedge funds that have exhibited attractive risk reward characteristics and low correlation to other investments in the portfolio  as opposed to individual investments that have shown the highest return  but also higher volatility of return 
we then combine the selected individual hedge funds into a portfolio of hedge funds 
by combining investments that we believe have moderate volatility and low correlations  we aim to achieve a hedge fund portfolio that has overall lower volatility relative to investing in a common stock portfolio or a typical fund of hedge funds portfolio 
as of december   the estimated impact on the hedge fund portfolio from an immediate basis point increase in market interest rates would have resulted in an estimated decrease in market value of  or approximately million  and the impact on the hedge fund portfolio from an immediate basis point decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in an estimated increase in market value of  or approximately million 
another method that attempts to measure portfolio risk is value at risk  or var 
var is a statistical risk measure  calculating the level of potential losses that could be expected to be exceeded  over a specified holding period and at a given level of confidence  in normal market conditions  and is expressed as a percentage of the portfolio s initial value 
since the var approach is based on historical positions and market data  var results should not be viewed as an absolute and predictive gauge of future financial performance or as a way for us to predict risk 
as of december   our hedge fund portfolio s var was estimated to be at the level of confidence and with a three month time horizon
