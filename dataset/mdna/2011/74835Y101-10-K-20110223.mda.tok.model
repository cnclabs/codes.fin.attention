the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company whose primary product helps patients with serious  difficult to treat medical conditions 
our primary product is hp acthar gel repository corticotropin injection  or acthar  an injectable drug that is approved by the fda 
acthar is only available in a multi use vial 
we derive substantially all of our net sales from the sale of acthar in the us and do not have operations outside of the us however  we own the worldwide rights to acthar 
acthar is approved for the treatment of indications  though we currently generate most of our net sales from two indications the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis  or ms  in adults  and the treatment of infantile spasms  or is  in infants and children under two years of age 
we are also exploring the other therapeutic areas where acthar is approved  including the use of acthar to induce a diuresis or a remission of proteinuria in the nephrotic syndrome without uremia of the idiopathic type or due to lupus erythematosus 
as a current on label indication for acthar  we have commenced a small pilot sales effort to attempt to generate incremental net sales and better understand the commercial opportunity for acthar in this indication 
we are also exploring the possibility of pursuing fda approval of additional indications not currently on the acthar label where there is high unmet medical need 
our other product is doral quazepam  which is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulty in falling asleep  frequent nocturnal awakenings  and or early morning awakenings 
we own the us rights to and have modest sales of doral 
results of operations years ended december   and net sales 
net sales  which we derive from our sales of acthar and doral  were million in  compared to million in and million in the following table sets forth our net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively dollars in thousands years ended december  revenue less sales reserves provision for medicaid rebates provision for chargebacks provision for tricare rebates co payment assistance and other total sales reserves net sales 
table of contents compared to net sales of acthar increased by approximately to million for the year ended december  from million in the increase in net sales for the year ended december  was due to an increase in vials of acthar shipped  to  in from  in  a reduction in the per vial rebate liability for both medicaid and tricare  and a reduction in the number of medicaid fee for service prescriptions 
this increase was partially offset by an increase in our medicaid managed care rebate  which became effective on march  during  we expanded our ms sales force to support our increased sales efforts related to the use of acthar for the treatment of exacerbations associated with ms 
our increased sales efforts and our initiatives to educate ms specialists about the treatment benefits of acthar have resulted in a significant increase in sales of acthar to treat select ms exacerbation patients for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in during the year ended december   new paid acthar prescriptions processed by our reimbursement support center for the treatment of ms exacerbations increased by approximately as compared to in order to build upon these positive prescription trends  we further expanded our sales organization during the second half of  resulting in a sales organization of sales representatives as of the end of we cannot assure you that this prescription growth trend will continue or that our sales force expansion will be successful 
the process of significantly expanding a sales force in the biopharmaceutical industry is complex 
we modify and re allocate individual sales territories across our enlarged sales force  which can cause temporary disruptions in our selling efforts 
additionally  while the cost of our new sales representatives impacts our operating expenses immediately  there can be a delay in the expected ability of our new representatives to increase our net sales due to the time it takes for us to train the new representatives and for the new representatives to establish relationships with prescribing physicians within their territories 
as such  even if our sales force expansion is successful in the long term  there can be a near term negative impact on our financial results from this expansion 
in addition  in january  we completed the hiring of five sales representatives who will market acthar exclusively to nephrologists for use in treating nephrotic syndrome 
effective january   we increased the price we charge curascript sd for acthar by 
compared to net sales of acthar decreased by approximately to million in from million in the decrease in net sales for the year ended december  was due to a combination of a lower number of prescriptions of acthar for the treatment of is  higher amounts of medicaid rebates related to previous paid acthar usage and an adjustment of our tricare rebate reserve during there has been significant variability in prescription activity in the use of acthar in the treatment of is and  while we can now market acthar for the treatment of is following the fda s approval of our snda on october   we expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in demand in this market 
we believe these fluctuations are principally due to the low incidence of is  as a relatively small number of cases can create meaningful fluctuations in net sales 
acthar orders may be affected by several factors  including inventory levels at specialty and hospital pharmacies  greater use of patient assistance programs  the overall pattern of usage by the health care community  including medicaid and government supported entities  the use of alternative therapies for the treatment of is  and the reimbursement policies of insurance companies 
our specialty distributor ships acthar to specialty pharmacies and hospitals to meet end user demand 
we track our own acthar shipments daily  but those shipments vary compared to end user demand because of changes in inventory levels at specialty pharmacies and hospitals 
cost of sales and gross profit years ended december  cost of sales gross profit gross margin cost of sales was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for and million for we include in cost of sales material costs  packaging  warehousing and distribution  product liability insurance  royalties  quality control which primarily includes product stability testing  quality assurance and reserves for excess or obsolete inventory 

table of contents our gross margin was or million in  as compared to  or million in and  or million in the increase in gross margin in as compared to and is primarily the result of continued growth in paid prescriptions for patients with ms 
the increase in cost of sales was primarily due to an increase in product stability testing and royalties on acthar net sales  offset by a reduction in distribution costs 
the manufacturing process for acthar is complex and problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons  including equipment malfunction  failure to follow specific protocols and procedures  problems with raw materials  natural disasters  and environmental factors 
during  our cost of sales increased because of the impact of some of these problems 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   as compared to million in and million in the increase of million in as compared to is due primarily to increases in headcount related costs and costs associated with our expanded sales and marketing effort 
during the latter part of  to further build on positive prescription trends  we doubled the size of our sales organization  increasing the sales force to acthar specialists 
the increase of million in as compared to reflects the initial expansion of our sales force to representatives and additional managers in order to build upon continued positive growth trends in prescriptions of acthar for the treatment of exacerbations associated with ms 
we cannot guarantee you that this prescription growth trend will continue or that our sales force expansion will be successful  and  even if it is successful in the long term  our sales force expansion may impact negatively our short term financial results 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million in  as compared to million in and million in the increase in research and development expenses in  as compared to  was primarily the result of both an increase in headcount related expenses and costs associated with the resubmission of our acthar snda for is 
costs included in research and development also include costs associated with the funding of medical research projects to better understand the therapeutic benefit of acthar in current and new therapeutic applications  product development efforts and compliance activities 
the slight decrease in research and development expenses from to was due primarily to decreases in the costs related to our resubmission of our snda  partially offset by increases in headcount related costs and funding of medical research projects 
we plan to continue our research and development efforts to explore the use of acthar as a therapeutic alternative for the treatment of nephrotic syndrome 
in  we supported investigator initiated studies in patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy on label and diabetic nephropathy not on label 
based on the results of these investigations  we currently intend to conduct a phase iv dose response clinical trial for idiopathic membranous nephropathy and a phase ii dose response clinical trial for diabetic nephropathy in these dose response clinical trials will result in a significant increase in research and development expenses in through we may also pursue clinical trials to evaluate the use of acthar to treat other therapeutic uses  including conditions that are not currently on the label of approved indications for acthar 
stock based compensation costs 
total stock based compensation costs for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   we granted options to employees and non employee directors to purchase million shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share  which was equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the grant 
in addition to stock options  we also issued restricted stock awards to certain employees 
the total stock based compensation costs for the years ended december   and included   and  respectively  related to these restricted stock awards 
the following table sets forth our stock based compensation costs for the years ended december   and  respectively dollars in thousands years ended december  selling  general and administrative research and development total stock based compensation expense total other income 
total other income for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million for and million for the decrease in total other income of million in as compared to was the result of a lower yield on our cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances year over year 
the decrease in total other income of million in as compared to was due to a lower yield on our cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances  offset by a million gain on the sale of product rights 

table of contents income tax expense 
income tax expense for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million in and million in the increase in income tax expense of million in as compared to was due to both an increase in net sales resulting in a higher basis for income taxes and the increase in the valuation allowance associated with our california deferred tax asset 
in the fourth quarter of  california enacted legislation that deferred the ability of corporations to utilize their california net operating losses 
starting in  we intend to use the single sales factor methodology for california  which we expect to result in tax savings beginning in because most of our sales are sourced outside of california  we do not expect to continue to pay significant income taxes in california 
as a result  we anticipate that we will not be able to fully utilize our california deferred tax asset and  therefore  have established a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset 
the decrease of million in income tax expense in as compared to was due to lower pre tax income in as compared to  offset by a higher effective tax rate in deemed dividend on series a preferred stock 
the deemed dividend on our series a preferred stock in of million resulted from the repurchase of our series a preferred stock in february we repurchased all of our outstanding series a preferred stock for cash consideration of million  or per share 
as of december   the series a preferred stock had a carrying amount of million  the deemed dividend represented the difference between the cash consideration actually paid by us and the carrying amount 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and working capital of million 
for  we generated million of cash from operations  primarily the result of net income of million  plus the total change in operating assets and liabilities of million which primarily included an increase in our sales related reserves of million  offset by a decrease in accounts payable of million  million in stock based compensation expense  million in amortization of investments and million in depreciation and amortization expense  offset by a reduction in our deferred tax asset of million 
for  we generated million of cash from operations  primarily the result of net income of million  plus the total change in operating assets and liabilities of million which included an increase in our sales related reserves of million  an increase in accounts payable of million  a decrease in prepaid income taxes of million  offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million  million in stock based compensation expense  million in depreciation and amortization expense offset by million in deferred income taxes  and million for the gain on sale of product rights 
for  we generated million of cash from operations  primarily the result of net income of million  plus the total change in operating assets and liabilities of million which included an increase in our sales related reserves of million  an increase in accounts payable of million  a decrease in accounts receivable of million  offset by an increase in prepaid income taxes of million and a decrease in income taxes payable of million  and million in stock based compensation expense  million in deferred income taxes 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in  primarily due to the purchase of short term investments million  offset by the maturities of short term investments million 
net cash provided by investing activities totaled million for  primarily due to the maturities of our short term investments million  offset by the purchase of short term investments million 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in  primarily due to the purchase of short term investments million  offset by the maturities of short term investments million 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million for  primarily due to the issuance of common stock associated with our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options 
net cash used in financing activities for totaled million as a result of the repurchase of million shares of our common stock for million under our board approved stock repurchase program  offset by million in cash received from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of common stock associated with our employee stock purchase program  or espp  and million in excess tax benefits from stock based compensation plans 
net cash used in financing activities for totaled million as a result of the repurchase of million shares of our common stock for million under our board approved stock repurchase program  the repurchase of the outstanding series a preferred stock for million  offset by million in cash received from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of common stock associated with our espp and million in excess tax benefits from stock based compensation plans 
in february  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase plan that provides for our repurchase of up to million of our shares of common stock in either open market or private transactions 
in may  our board of directors increased our common 
table of contents share repurchase program authorization by an additional million shares 
as of december   there are million shares authorized remaining under the stock repurchase plan 
we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program during we do not currently intend to conduct business development activities which would utilize a material portion of our liquidity 
we review our level of liquidity and anticipated cash needs for the business on an ongoing basis  and consider whether to return additional capital to our shareholders as well as alternative methods to return capital 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  this table does not include potential milestone payments and assumes non termination of agreements 
payments due by period total year or less to years to years after years in s minimum payments remaining under operating leases total contractual cash obligations as of december  we leased space in four buildings with lease terms expiring in   and  and subleased additional office space with a term expiring in we have also entered into various office equipment leases and automobile leases  the terms of which are typically three years 
annual rent expense for all of our facilities  equipment and automobile leases for the year ended december  was approximately million 
we lease  square feet of office space and warehouse space in union city  california under a lease agreement that expires in march our commercial development  sales and marketing  medical affairs  contract manufacturing  quality control and quality assurance departments occupy this facility 
in connection with the expiration of this lease  we are moving these functions to the hayward  california facility 
we lease  square feet of laboratory and office space in hayward  california under a master lease that expires in november effective november  we subleased  square feet of the facility through november and effective september  we subleased  square feet on a month to month basis 
we will occupy the remainder of this lease following the expiration of the union city lease in march we lease  square feet of office space in ellicott city  maryland under a lease agreement that expires in october our product development and regulatory affairs departments occupy this facility 
we lease  square feet of office space in anaheim  california under a lease agreement that expires in october our executive  finance and administration departments occupy this facility  and serves as our corporate headquarters 
critical accounting policies and estimates we base our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  upon our consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
we describe our significant accounting policies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we include within these policies our critical accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are those policies that are most important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and require management s most subjective and complex judgment due to the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
changes in estimates and assumptions based upon actual results may have a material impact on our results of operations and or financial condition 
we believe that the critical accounting policies that most impact the consolidated financial statements are as described below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting standards codification  or asc   revenue recognition products  or asc  from sales of acthar and doral 
pursuant to asc  we recognize revenue when we have persuasive evidence that an 
table of contents arrangement  agreement or contract exists  when title for our product and risk of loss has passed to our customer  the price we charge for our product is fixed or is readily determinable  and we are reasonably assured of collecting the amounts owed under the resulting receivable 
for sales of both of our products  we do not require collateral from our customers 
we also support acthar patient assistance programs administered by the national organization for rare disorders  or nord  and the chronic disease fund 
these and other patient oriented support programs have now provided free drug with a commercial value of over million to patients since september through december  we do not recognize any revenue from our free drug program 
in the us  our exclusive customer for acthar is curascript sd 
we sell acthar at a discount from our list price to curascript sd  which then sells acthar primarily to approximately specialty pharmacies  including curascript specialty pharmacy  or curascript sp  and to many hospitals 
we record a sale of acthar when curascript sd accepts a shipment of acthar based on its order of acthar from integrated commercialization services  inc  or ics  our exclusive distributor for commercial shipment and distribution of our products to our customers 
in addition to acthar  we sell doral to pharmaceutical wholesalers  who in turn sell doral primarily to retail pharmacies and hospitals 
international sales of our products are immaterial 
net sales we record net sales after establishing reserves for the following medicaid rebates  tricare retail program rebates  chargebacks due to other government programs  questcor sponsored co pay assistance programs  and other deductions such as payment discounts 
we currently provide our products to medicaid participants under an agreement with the center for medicare and medicaid services  or cms 
under this agreement  states are eligible to receive rebates from us for medicaid patients in accordance with cms regulations 
states typically provide us with rebate invoices for their reimbursements between to days after the end of the calendar quarter in which our products were provided 
we estimate the end of period liability and the sales reserve needed for these medicaid rebates based on the following multi step process using a predictive model  we review national medicaid statistics as well as internal information received from the acthar reimbursement support center and from curascript sp for the most recent completed quarter to develop an estimate of future medicaid rebate invoices that we expect to receive for the most recently completed quarter 
this includes an estimate for both future medicaid managed care and medicaid fee for service rebate invoices 
we review the medicaid rebate invoices received during the last days and compare those invoices to the reserve that we had previously set at the end of the prior quarter 
based on this comparison and using our predictive model  which we update quarterly based on all information available to us at the time  we estimate the remaining liability that we believe is still outstanding for periods prior to the most recently completed quarter 
based on estimated end of quarter inventory held at curascript sd and at all specialty pharmacies and hospitals  we calculate the expected future rebate liability for that portion of the inventory which we eventually will use to fill prescriptions for medicaid patients 
using a similar process  we estimate the end of period liability and the sales reserve needed for tricare program rebates and chargebacks from other government programs 
we also sponsor co pay assistance programs for acthar patients which are administered by nord and the chronic disease fund 
we account for these payments as a reduction to our revenue 
our resulting total sales reserve for the quarter includes the sum of the medicaid sales reserve  the tricare sales reserve  the chargeback sales reserve  co pay assistance payments  and payment discounts provided 
we believe that the assumptions we used to estimate these sales reserves are reasonable considering known facts and circumstances 
however  significant judgment is inherent in our selection of assumptions and the interpretation of historical experience as well as the identification of external and internal factors affecting the estimate of our reserves for medicaid rebates and other government program rebates and chargebacks 
our medicaid rebates and other government program rebates and chargebacks could differ significantly from our estimates because of unanticipated changes in prescription trends or patterns in the states submissions of medicaid claims  adjustments to the amount of product in the distribution channel  or if our estimate of the number of medicaid patients with is and ms are incorrect 
if actual medicaid rebates  or other government program rebates and chargebacks are 
table of contents significantly different from our estimates  we would account for such differences in the period in which they become known 
if actual future payments for such reserves exceed the estimates we made at the time of sale  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows may be negatively impacted 
medicaid rebates and the new national health care legislation in march  congress passed  and the president signed into law  the healthcare reform acts 
the healthcare reform acts contain a number of provisions that have impacted  both positively and negatively  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the provisions of the healthcare reform acts have reduced our rebate provided to states for prescriptions filled for medicaid patients to of the amp  which approximates the amount we charge to curascript sd 
before the passage of the healthcare reform acts  the formula used to calculate the per vial rebate required us to rebate of our amp for acthar 
effective march   the healthcare reform acts extended required medicaid rebates to medicaid managed care plans 
medicaid managed care plans provide for the delivery of medicaid health benefits and additional services through an arrangement between a state medicaid agency and managed care organizations 
our provision for expected medicaid rebate liability and our quarterly sales reserves have included an estimate for medicaid managed care usage since march  we have reserved million for expected medicaid managed care rebates since march  we have begun to receive medicaid managed care rebate invoices and expect to receive additional rebate invoices as state medicaid agencies complete the implementation of their internal invoice processing systems 
other impacts from the national health care legislation in addition to the aforementioned impact to our required medicaid rebates  the healthcare reform acts contain a number of provisions that we expect to continue to impact  both positively and negatively  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
positive impact 
the healthcare reform acts contain provisions that create a national high risk insurance pool  temporarily extend health coverage to individuals with pre existing medical conditions  prohibit the denial of health coverage to children with pre existing conditions  prohibit the denial of health coverage to adults with pre existing conditions and place limits on insurers with respect to lifetime and annual caps on health coverage  and increase the number of patients with private insurance 
negative impact 
the healthcare reform acts contain the following provisions that we have identified as having a negative or potential negative impact on our overall financial position  results of operations and cash flows effective march   medicaid managed care programs became eligible for drug rebates 
this expanded eligibility affected our rebate liability for those state entities which had medicaid managed care programs  but had not previously taken legislative action at the state level to permit drugs provided to medicaid managed care patients to be eligible for medicaid rebates approximately states 
effective january   pharmaceutical companies  including questcor  must provide rebates to cover a portion of the medicare part d coverage gap or donut hole  which is a portion of the gap between medicare funding and medicare recipient s drug deductibles 
approximately of our sales for ms are to medicare insureds 
we estimate our obligation could be as much as  per medicare insured in at current sales levels  we estimate that this obligation would be less than million per year 
effective january   the us federal government will allocate an annual fee among manufacturers of branded prescription drugs based on market share for specified government programs 
the healthcare reform acts determine an individual manufacturer s market share as the ratio of its aggregate sales of branded prescription drugs during the preceding calendar year as a percentage of the aggregate branded prescription drug sales for all covered manufacturers 
we expect the number of medicaid patients to increase gradually through we further expect this expansion more likely to impact the number of adults in medicaid because many states have already set their eligibility criteria for children at or above the level designated in the healthcare reform acts 
an increase in the proportion of patients who receive acthar and who are covered by medicaid could adversely affect our net sales 
substantial new provisions affecting compliance also have been added  which may require us to modify our business practices with health care practitioners 
our failure to comply with these new provisions may subject us to significant penalties or enforcement actions  either of which may negatively impact the results of our operations or business 

table of contents presently  uncertainty exists as many of the specific determinations necessary to implement the healthcare reform acts have yet to be decided and communicated to industry participants 
for example  under medicaid mco  the affected states have only begun to bill us for medicaid mco rebates  as many of the states are still implementing their internal systems in order to submit medicaid rebate claims to us 
additionally  we do not yet know when we will have to provide discounts to additional hospitals eligible to participate under the b program 
we have made several estimates with regard to important assumptions relevant to determining the financial impact of the healthcare reform acts on our business due to the lack of availability of both certain information and complete understanding of how the process of applying the healthcare reform acts will be implemented 
based on these estimates and assumptions  the healthcare reform acts overall did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations in  however  the healthcare reform acts could have a material adverse effect on our future business  cash flows  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  congress and the president may make additional refinements to the healthcare reform acts which may have an additional  potential negative impact on our overall financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
at this time  we cannot predict the full impact of the healthcare reform acts  or the timing and impact of any future rules or regulations promulgated to implement the healthcare reform acts 
it is possible that the healthcare reform acts and related rulemaking actions may have an overall negative effect on our net sales over time  however  at this time  we cannot determine the timing and magnitude of various positive and negative effects upon our business 
furthermore  there continues to be active debate in congress and the courts ranging from repeal of the healthcare reform acts to no change in the law 
tricare retail pharmacy programs the department of defense  or dod  tricare retail pharmacy program became effective on may   pursuant to section of the national defense authorization act of this program and its regulations require manufacturers to pay rebates  retroactive to january   to the dod on products distributed to tricare beneficiaries through retail pharmacies 
the regulation further requires that pharmaceutical products paid for by the dod through the tricare retail pharmacy program be subject to the federal ceiling price program  which requires manufacturers to provide the dod with a refund on pharmaceutical products utilized through the tricare retail pharmacy program 
as a result  we established a sales reserve of million for tricare rebates as of the year ended december  which covered of our estimated liability for the time period january  through december  effective january   we entered into a new pricing agreement with the veterans administration  resulting in a rebate for pharmaceutical products utilized through the tricare retail pharmacy program during of  per vial  or a reduction of  from the previous rebates of  as a result  we recorded sales reserves of million for the year ended december   for which we received invoices for million government chargebacks we permit certain other government supported entities  such as those covered by our contract with the va or eligible public health service  or phs  b entities  to purchase acthar from curascript sd based on a contractual amount 
because our payment terms with curascript sd are approximately to days  we include actual chargebacks taken plus an estimate applied to the units in channel when estimating the sales reserve related to government chargebacks 
sales to the veteran administration and phs b entities are generally immaterial to our financial position as a whole 
co pay assistance programs we sponsor co pay assistance programs for acthar patients which are administered by nord and the chronic disease fund 
we account for these co pay assistance program payments as a reduction to our revenue 
total sales related reserves at december  and sales related reserves included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were as follows in thousands years ended december  medicaid rebates tricare rebates government chargebacks total 
table of contents product sales returns on a limited basis  we generally authorize acthar exchanges for expiring and expired product in accordance with our stated return policy  which allows curascript sd to return product within one month of its expiration date and for a period up to three months after such product has reached its expiration date 
we exchange returns for replacement product and we include in the cost of sales the estimated costs for such exchanges  which include actual product material costs and related shipping charges 
product exchanges have been insignificant since we began utilizing the services of curascript sd to distribute acthar 
inventories we state inventories  net of allowances  at the lower of cost or market 
we determine cost by the first in  first to expire method 
we review inventory periodically for slow moving or obsolete status 
we adjust our inventory to reflect situations in which we do not expect to recover the cost of inventory 
we would record a reserve to adjust inventory to its net realizable value i when a product is close to expiration and we do not expect it to be sold  ii when a product has reached its expiration date or iii when we do not expect a product to be saleable 
in determining the reserves for these products  we consider factors such as the amount of inventory on hand and its remaining shelf life  and current and expected market conditions  including management forecasts and levels of competition 
we have evaluated the current level of inventory considering historical trends and other factors  and based on our evaluation  have recorded adjustments to reflect inventory at its net realizable value 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly from actual results if future economic conditions  customer demand  competition or other relevant factors differ from expectations 
these estimates require us to assess the future demand for our products in order to categorize the status of such inventory items as slow moving  obsolete or in excess of need 
these future estimates are subject to the ongoing accuracy of our forecasts of market conditions  industry trends  competition and other factors 
differences between our estimated reserves and actual inventory adjustments have been immaterial  and we account for such adjustments in the current period as a change in estimate 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense for all stock based awards made to employees and directors 
we estimate the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date using an option pricing model and we recognize the portion that we ultimately expect to vest as compensation cost over the requisite service period 
since we recognize stock based compensation only for those awards that we ultimately expect to vest  we have applied an estimated forfeiture rate to unvested awards for the purpose of calculating compensation cost 
these estimates will be revised  if necessary  in future periods if actual forfeitures differ from estimates 
changes in forfeiture estimates impact compensation cost in the period in which the change in estimate occurs 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock based awards 
the determination of fair value using the black scholes option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables  including expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  expected dividends and expected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
we estimate the expected term based on the contractual term of the awards and employees exercise and expected post vesting termination behavior 
at december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock options  which is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted average vesting period of approximately years 
income taxes we account for income taxes under asc  income taxes  or asc we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure under the most recent tax laws and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market rate risk the primary objective of our investment policy is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in had market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later increases  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
seeking to minimize this risk  we place our investments with high quality issuers and follow internally developed guidelines to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
additionally  in an attempt to limit interest rate risk  we follow guidelines to limit the average and longest single maturity dates 
our investments include money market accounts  government sponsored enterprises  certificates of deposit and municipal bonds 
none of our investments are in auction rate securities 
the significant majority of our sales occur within the united states 
accordingly  we have not had any exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
