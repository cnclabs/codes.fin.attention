item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business description and overview the company s core competency is flow measurement solutions 
the company is a leading manufacturer and marketer of products incorporating liquid flow measurement and control technologies developed both internally and with other technology companies 
its products are used in a variety of applications  including water  oil and chemicals 
the company s product lines fall into two categories water applications and specialty applications 
water applications  the largest category by sales volume  include water meters and related technologies and services used by water utilities as the basis for generating water and wastewater revenues 
the key market for the company s water meter products is north america  primarily the united states  because the meters are designed and manufactured to conform to standards promulgated by the american water works association 
the company s products are also sold for other water based purposes including irrigation  water reclamation and industrial process applications 
specialty applications include the sale of meters and related technologies and services for measuring a wide variety of fluids in industries such as food and beverage  pharmaceutical production  petroleum  heating  ventilating and air conditioning hvac  and measuring and dispensing automotive fluids 
it also includes the sale of radio technology to natural gas utilities for installation on their gas meters 
additional information about the company s business is described in part  item business under the heading market overview  products  systems and solutions in this annual report on form k 
business trends increasingly  the electric utility industry relies on ami technology for two way communication to monitor and control electrical devices at the customer s site 
although the company does not sell products for electric market applications  the trend toward ami affects the markets in which the company does participate  particularly the water utility market 
specifically  ami enables water utilities to capture interval readings from each meter at specific intervals 
in early  the company introduced what it believes will be the next generation of metering technology  advanced metering analytics ama  that incorporates both drive by and fixed network reading capabilities  along with a host of automated utility management tools to facilitate the ability of water utilities to increase their 
table of contents productivity and revenue 
ama is comprised of readcenter analytics software coupled with the new orion se two way fixed network technology  which is complemented by a family of highly accurate and reliable meters 
utilities will be able to proactively manage their day to day operations through powerful analytics based software and two way fixed network meter reading 
the company sells its technology solutions to meet customer requirements 
since the technology products have comparable margins  any acceleration or slowdown in the trend toward amr  ami or ama is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s net sales related to meter reading technology 
there are approximately  water utilities in the united states and the company estimates that less than percent of them have converted to an amr or ami technology 
although there is growing interest in ami communication by water utilities  the vast majority of utilities installing amr or ami technology continue to select amr technologies for their applications 
the company s orion technology has experienced rapid acceptance in the united states as an increasing number of water utilities have selected orion as their amr solution 
the company anticipates that even with growing interest in ami  amr will continue to be the primary product of choice for a number of years 
for many water utilities  amr technology is simply the most cost effective solution available today 
however  with the introduction of ama  the company believes it is well positioned to meet customers future needs 
acquisition on april   the company purchased cox instruments  llc of scottsdale  arizona  and its subsidiary flow dynamics  inc for million 
cox instruments and flow dynamics manufacture and market precision high performance flow meters that are used in demanding applications such as aerospace  custody transfer and flow measurement test stands 
the company merged the two entities into a wholly owned subsidiary named cox flow measurement  inc on april   and merged the subsidiary into badger meter  inc on december  this acquisition is further described in note acquisitions  investment and discontinued operations in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
revenue and product mix prior to the company s introduction of its own proprietary amr products orion  itron water utility related products were a dominant amr contributor to the company s results 
itron products are sold under an agreement between the company and itron  inc that has been renewed multiple times and is in effect until early the company s orion products directly compete with itron water amr products 
in recent years  many of the company s customers have selected orion products over itron products 
while orion sales were times greater than those of the itron licensed products for  and times greater for  the company expects that the itron products will remain a significant component of sales to utilities 
continuing sales in both product lines underscores the continued acceptance of amr technology by water utilities and affirms the company s strategy of selling itron products in addition to its own proprietary products 
as the industry continues to evolve  the company has been vigilant in anticipating and exceeding customer expectations 
in early  the company introduced ama as a hardware and software solution for water and gas utilities  which it believes will help maintain its position as a market leader 
the company continues to seek opportunities for additional revenue enhancement 
for instance  the company is periodically asked to oversee and perform field installation of its products for certain customers 
the company assumes the role of general contractor  hiring installation subcontractors and supervising their work 
the company also supports its product and technology sales with the sale of extended service programs that provide additional services beyond the standard warranty 
in recent years  the company has also sold orion radio technology to natural gas utilities for installation on their gas meters 
the revenues from such products and services are not yet significant and the company is uncertain of the potential growth achievable for such products and services in future periods 

table of contents results of operations net sales net sales in increased million  or  to million from million in the overall increase was the net result of higher volumes for many of the company s products  particularly in specialty application products 
in addition  certain product lines were favorably affected by price increases 
water application products represented of total net sales in compared to in these sales increased in by million  or  to million from million 
sales increased in amr ami related products due to volume and price increases 
the company believes customers who had delayed purchasing decisions because of the possibility of funds becoming available under us government stimulus programs made purchases in as funds were allocated and buying patterns returned to more normal levels 
sales of the company s orion technology products increased from levels and sales of the itron related products saw an increase from levels 
in  orion related water products outsold itron related water products by a ratio of to sales of local or manual read meters declined as more customers continue to purchase automated systems 
commercial meter sales in were slightly higher than in due to volume and price increases 
specialty products represented of total sales in compared to in these sales increased million  or  to million in compared to million in the increase was due to increased volumes over unusually low levels  due to improving economic conditions  the acquisition of cox flow measurement in the second quarter of and increased sales of the orion radio into the natural gas market 
sales of natural gas related products increased million from million in to nearly million in much of this increase was attributable to one customer  whom the company expects will continue to purchase for the next two years 
international sales for water application meters and related technologies are generally made to customers in canada and mexico  which use similar mechanical technology as customers in the us international sales for other water application and specialty application products are comprised primarily of sales of small valves  electromagnetic meters and automotive fluid meters in europe  sales of electromagnetic meters and related technologies in latin america  and sales of valves and other metering products throughout the world 
in europe  sales are made primarily in euros 
other international sales are made in us dollars or local currencies 
international sales increased to million in from million in primarily due to higher water application product sales in mexico and higher specialty application product sales in a variety of other countries as the global economy slowly recovers 
the company s net sales decreased by million  or  in to million from million in the decrease was driven by lower sales of the company s products due principally to volume declines  offset somewhat by higher prices on certain products 
water application products represented of total net sales in compared to in sales declined in all water application product lines 
sales of water application products decreased to million  a decrease from sales in of million 
this decrease was driven by lower volumes of meters sold  both with and without amr ami technologies 
while the state of the economy certainly played a role in the sales decline  the company also believes some customers delayed purchasing decisions because of the possibility that funds would become available under us government stimulus programs 
sales of the company s orion technology products in decreased from levels and sales of the itron related products in were a decrease from levels 
in  orion related products outsold itron related products by a ratio of to commercial meter sales decreased nearly due to volume declines compared to  which was an exceptionally strong year for these products 
specialty products represented of total net sales in compared to in these sales declined by million  or  to million in from million in due to volume declines related to the economic conditions 

table of contents international sales decreased by to million in from million in due to lower sales of products in europe and mexico as a result of global economic conditions and to foreign currency translation effects 
gross margins gross margins as a percentage of sales were  and for  and  respectively 
gross margins were lower in compared to due to significantly higher commodity costs  particularly copper  mitigated somewhat by higher prices charged for the company s products as well as cost reductions as the company begins to transition additional operations to its mexican facilities 
this transition is expected to be completed in the second quarter of approximately positions are being transferred from the milwaukee facility to the mexican facility as part of a plan to move production to lower cost facilities 
gross margins increased in over as a result of lower commodity costs  particularly copper that was substantially under levels  and the favorable effects of manufacturing cost control efforts 
partially offsetting this was the effect of lower sales of certain higher margin products  including products that are sold with amr ami technologies 
operating expenses selling  engineering and administration costs increased million  or  in compared to the increase was due to the addition of cox flow measurement in the second quarter of  higher employee incentives due to increased sales and normal inflationary increases  offset somewhat by continuing cost controls 
these increases were partially offset by a one time credit of million for the fair value of land received in settlement of claims against a building contractor 
selling  engineering and administration costs decreased by nearly million  or  in compared to due to lower commissions payable on lower sales volumes  lower employee incentives  headcount reductions  favorable healthcare experience and continuing cost control efforts 
this was offset somewhat by a full year s amortization of the galaxy fixed network ami technology compared to a partial year in  additional costs for qualifying for us government stimulus fund program requests  early retirement and severance expenses and normal inflationary increases 
operating earnings operating earnings in increased million  or  to million compared to million in the increase was due to the increase in sales  mitigated somewhat by higher costs of purchased components  notably castings which have copper as their main component  as well as increased selling  engineering and administration costs 
the gross margin in was million  which was million  or  higher compared to the gross margin of million and was the principal reason for the increase in operating earnings 
operating earnings in increased million  or  to million compared to million in the impact of lower sales was significantly mitigated by lower commodity costs in the net gross margin decline in was more than offset by lower selling  engineering and administration costs compared to interest expense income  net interest expense income  net was million in compared to million in the increase was due to the reversal in of million that was previously accrued during and relating to the french tax issue discussed below under discontinued operations and lower overall debt balances 
interest income expense  net was million in compared to interest expense of million in the decrease was due to the reversal in of million discussed below under discontinued operations and lower overall debt balances 

table of contents income taxes income taxes as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were   and for  and  respectively 
the decrease between and was due to higher federal benefits for domestic production activities and increased foreign income tax benefits 
there were no significant changes between and earnings and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations primarily as a result of the increased operating earnings and lower effective income tax rate  earnings from continuing operations were million in compared to million in on a diluted basis  earnings per share from continuing operations were compared to for the same periods 
the increase in net earnings from continuing operations of million in compared to million in was the result of increased operating earnings as well as the one time interest reversal discussed below under discontinued operations 
on a diluted basis  earnings per share from continuing operations in were compared to for discontinued operations the results include recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits for certain deductions that were taken on prior tax returns related to the shutdown of the company s french subsidiaries  which were reflected as a discontinued operation 
these tax benefits million were recognized as earnings from discontinued operations in due to the realization that such tax benefits became more likely than not upon the conclusion of an irs audit of the company s federal income tax return 
on a diluted basis  earnings per share from discontinued operations for were 
the company recorded interest income in continuing operations during  because it recognized an interest expense reversal of million that was previously accrued during and relating to this uncertain tax position 
liquidity and capital resources the main sources of liquidity for the company are cash from operations and borrowing capacity 
cash provided by operations in was million compared to million in the decrease in cash provided by operations in was due to higher inventory and receivable balances  offset somewhat by higher earnings from continuing operations and lower pension plan contributions 
cash provided by operations in was million compared to million in the increase in cash provided by operations in was due to lower inventory and receivables balances and increased earnings  partially offset by contributions to the company s pension plan 
receivables at december  were million compared to million in the increase is due to higher sales  particularly in the fourth quarter of compared to the prior year 
there were several accounts with past due balances at year end  of which a significant amount was paid in early in addition  terms for distributors meeting certain criteria were extended to days from days for providing services that the company had previously provided directly to customers 
the company believes its net receivables balance is fully collectible 
inventories at december  were million compared to million at december  the increase was due to increased costs  particularly castings of which copper is a main component  increased lead times on electronic components and intentionally higher levels of inventory being carried as the company continues to transition production to mexico 
higher levels of inventory for were also due to delays in late related to certain anticipated projects in mexico and the acquisition of cox flow measurement 
capital expenditures totaled million in  million in and million in these amounts vary due to the timing of capital expenditures 
included in capital expenditures for were approximately million related to the construction of a facility in mexico and a small addition to the czech republic facility 
the company believes it has adequate capacity to increase production levels with minimal additional capital expenditures 

table of contents intangible assets increased to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to a payment of million to license the manufacture and sale of a key component of the company s line of turbine meters 
also included in the increase were the intangible assets acquired as part of the cox flow measurement acquisition 
these increases were offset by normal amortization 
other assets increased to million at december  compared to million at december  of which the majority was due to the company investing million to purchase a small ownership percentage in an emerging technology company 
long term deferred income tax assets declined to million at december  compared to million due to the timing of certain tax deductions 
goodwill increased to million at december  compared to million at december  the increase was due to the acquisition of cox flow measurement 
short term debt  the current portion of long term debt and long term debt increased from december  to december  these accounts totaled million at december   an increase from million at december  the increase was a function of the working capital needed to fund operations  acquisition of cox flow measurement  the acquisition of an million license to manufacture and sell a key component of the company s turbine meters and a small investment in an emerging technology company 
at the end of  debt represented of the company s total capitalization 
none of the company s debt carries financial covenants or is secured 
payables increased by million to million at december  compared to million at december   primarily as the result of the timing of purchases 
accrued compensation and employee benefits increased million between years due primarily to higher employee incentives 
other accrued employee benefits decreased to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to contributions made in to the company s pension plan 
common stock and capital in excess of par value both increased during due to the exercise of stock options  stock compensation expense and the tax benefit on stock options 
treasury stock decreased slightly due to shares issued in connection with the company s dividend reinvestment program 
accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased by million in from  net of tax  primarily due to changes in the funded status of the company s pension plan and other postretirement benefits 
the company s financial condition remains strong 
in october  the company renewed its principal line of credit increasing it to million for one year with its primary lender 
the company believes that its operating cash flows  available borrowing capacity  and its ability to raise capital provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements  future capital expenditures and the development of new products 
the company continues to take advantage of its local commercial paper market and carefully monitors the current borrowing market 
the company had million of unused credit lines available at december  off balance sheet arrangements the company had no off balance sheet arrangements at december  contractual obligations in  the company restructured the outstanding debt of its employee savings and stock option plan the essop by loaning the essop million to repay a loan to a third party and loaning the essop an additional million to purchase additional shares of the company s common stock for future k savings plan matches under a program that will expire on december  under this program  the company agreed to pay the principal and interest on the new loan amount of million 
the receivable from the essop and the related obligation were therefore netted to zero on the company s consolidated balance sheets at december  the terms of the loan call for equal payments of principal with the final payment due on december  a similar amount of unearned compensation has been recorded as a reduction of shareholders equity 

table of contents the following table includes the company s significant contractual obligations as of december  there are no undisclosed guarantees 
payments due by period less than total year years years in thousands short term debt operating leases total contractual obligations other than items included in the preceding table  as of december   the company had no additional material purchase obligations other than those created in the ordinary course of business related to inventory and property  plant and equipment  which generally have terms of less than days 
the company also has long term obligations related to its pension and postretirement plans which are discussed in detail in note employee benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
as of the most recent actuarial measurement date  the company does not expect to make a contribution for the calendar year 
postretirement medical claims are paid by the company as they are submitted  and they are anticipated to be million in based on actuarial estimates  however  these amounts can vary significantly from year to year because the company is self insured 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
as discussed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
the company s more significant estimates relate primarily to the following judgmental reserves allowance for doubtful accounts  reserve for obsolete inventories  warranty and after sale costs reserve  and the healthcare reserve for claims incurred  as well as claims incurred but not reported 
each of these reserves is evaluated quarterly and is reviewed with the company s disclosure committee and the audit and compliance committee of the board of directors 
the basis for the reserve amounts is determined by analyzing the anticipated exposure for each account  and then selecting the most likely amount based upon historical experience and various other considerations that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these methods have been used for all years in the presented financials and have been used consistently throughout each year 
actual results may differ from these estimates if actual experiences vary from the company s assumptions 
the criteria used for calculating each of the reserve amounts vary by type of reserve 
for the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve  significant past due balances are individually reviewed for collectibility  while the balance of accounts are reviewed in conjunction with applying historical write off ratios 
the calculation for the obsolete inventories reserve is determined by analyzing the relationship between the age and quantity of items on hand versus estimated usage to determine if excess quantities exist 
the calculation for warranty and after sale costs reserve uses criteria that include known potential problems on past sales as well as historical claim experience and current warranty trends 
the healthcare reserve for claims incurred  but not reported is determined by using medical cost trend analyses  reviewing subsequent payments made and estimating unbilled amounts 
the changes in the balances of these reserves at december  compared to the prior year were due to normal business conditions and are not deemed to be significant 
while the company continually tries to improve its estimates  no significant changes in the underlying processes are expected in  with the exception that on january   the company froze its pension plan for its non union participants and formed a new feature within the essop plan in which each employee will receive a similar benefit 
the company also uses estimates in four other significant areas i pension and other postretirement obligations and costs  ii stock based compensation  iii income taxes  and iv evaluating goodwill at least annually for impairment 
the actuarial valuations of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs rely on key 
table of contents assumptions including discount rates  long term expected return on plan assets and future compensation 
the company s discount rate assumptions for its pension and postretirement plans are based on the average yield of a hypothetical high quality bond portfolio with maturities that approximately match the estimated cash flow needs of the plans 
the assumptions for expected long term rates of return on assets for its pension plan are based on historical experience and estimated future investment returns  taking into consideration anticipated asset allocations  investment strategies and the views of various investment professionals 
the total cost of the company s share based awards is equal to the grant date fair value per award multiplied by the number of awards granted  adjusted for forfeitures 
forfeitures are initially estimated based on historical company information and subsequently updated over the life of the awards to ultimately reflect actual forfeitures  which could have an impact on the amount of stock compensation cost recognized from period to period 
in calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis  the company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period 
on a quarterly basis  the actual effective tax rate is adjusted as appropriate based upon the actual results compared to those forecasted at the beginning of the fiscal year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the reserve for uncertainty in income taxes is a matter of judgment based on an evaluation of the individual facts and circumstances of each tax position in light of all available evidence  including historic data and current trends 
a tax benefit is recognized when it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the technical merits of each tax position 
goodwill impairment  if any  is determined by comparing the fair value of the operating unit with its carrying value 
the company evaluates and updates all of these assumptions quarterly 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
other matters the company is subject to contingencies related to environmental laws and regulations 
the company is named as one of many potentially responsible parties in two landfill lawsuits and is in the process of resolving a claim related to a parcel of land adjoining the company s property 
the landfill sites are impacted by the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and other environmental laws and regulations 
at this time  the company does not believe the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations  either from a cash flow perspective or on the financial statements as a whole 
regarding the landfill sites  this belief is based on the company s assessment of its limited past involvement with these landfill sites as well as the substantial involvement of and government focus on other named third parties with these landfill sites 
however  due to the inherent uncertainties of such proceedings  the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of any of these matters 
a future change in circumstances with respect to these specific matters or with respect to sites formerly or currently owned or operated by the company  off site disposal locations used by the company  and property owned by third parties that is near such sites  could result in future costs to the company and such amounts could be material 
expenditures during  and for compliance with environmental control provisions and regulations were not material 
like other companies in recent years  the company has been named as a defendant in numerous multi claimant multi defendant lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos  manufactured by third parties  and integrated into or sold with a very limited number of the company s products 
the company is vigorously defending itself against these claims 
although it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters  the company does not believe the ultimate resolution of these issues will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations  either from a cash flow perspective or on the financial statements as a whole 
this belief is based in part on the fact that no claimant has proven or substantially demonstrated asbestos exposure caused by products manufactured or sold by the company and that a number of cases have been voluntarily dismissed 
see the special note regarding forward looking statements at the front of this annual report on form k and part i  item a risk factors in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  for a discussion of risks and uncertainties that could impact the company s financial performance and results of operations 

table of contents market risks in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to various market risks 
the company operates in an environment where competition varies from moderate to intense 
the company believes it currently provides the leading technology in water meters and amr ami systems for water utilities 
a number of the company s competitors in certain markets have greater financial resources 
competitors also include alliance partners that sell products that do or may compete with our products  particularly those that provide amr ami connectivity solutions 
in addition  the market s level of acceptance of the company s newer products  such as the recently introduced ama systems  may have a significant effect on the company s results of operations 
as a result of significant research and development activities  the company enjoys favorable patent positions for several of its products 
the company s ability to generate operating income and to increase profitability depends somewhat on the general health of the united states and foreign economies  including to some extent such things as the length and severity of global economic downturns  the timing and size of governmental programs such as stimulus fund programs  the ability of municipal water utility customers to authorize and finance purchases of the company s products  the company s ability to obtain financing  housing starts in the united states  and overall industrial activity 
in addition  changes in governmental laws and regulations  particularly laws dealing with the use of lead or rules affecting the use and or licensing of radio frequencies necessary for amr ami ama products may impact the results of operations 
these factors are largely beyond the company s control and depend on the economic condition and regulatory environment of the geographic region of the company s operations 
the company relies on single suppliers for certain castings and components in several of its product lines 
although alternate sources of supply exist for these items  the loss of certain suppliers could temporarily disrupt operations in the short term 
the company attempts to mitigate these risks by working closely with key suppliers  purchasing minimal amounts from alternative suppliers and by purchasing business interruption insurance where appropriate 
raw materials used in the manufacture of the company s products include purchased castings made of metal or alloys such as bronze  which uses copper as its main component  aluminum  stainless steel  cast iron  brass and stellite  plastic resins  glass  microprocessors and other electronic subassemblies and components 
the company does not hold significant amounts of precious metals 
the price and availability of raw materials is influenced by economic and industry conditions  including supply and demand factors that are difficult to anticipate and cannot be controlled by the company 
commodity risk is managed by keeping abreast of economic conditions and locking in purchase prices for quantities that correspond to the company s forecasted usage 
the company s foreign currency risk relates to the sales of products to foreign customers and purchases of material from foreign vendors 
the company uses lines of credit with us and european banks to offset currency exposure related to european receivables and other monetary assets 
as of december  and  the company s foreign currency net monetary assets were substantially offset by comparable debt resulting in no material exposure to the results of operations 
the company typically does not hold or issue derivative instruments and has a policy specifically prohibiting the use of such instruments for trading purposes 
the company s short term debt on december  was floating rate debt with market values approximating carrying value 
future annual interest costs for short term debt will fluctuate based upon short term interest rates 
for the short term debt on hand on december   the effect of a change in interest rates is approximately  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures of market risk information required by this item is set forth in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading market risks in this annual report on form k
