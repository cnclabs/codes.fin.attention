com and www 
planprescriber 
com  consumers can get quotes from leading health insurance carriers  compare plans side by side  and apply for and purchase individual and family  small business  short term  ancillary and medicare related health insurance plans 
our ecommerce technology also enables us to deliver consumers health insurance applications electronically to health insurance carriers 
as a result  we simplify and streamline the complex and traditionally paper intensive health insurance sales and purchasing process 
we have invested heavily in technology and content related to our ecommerce platform 
we have also invested significant time and resources in obtaining licenses to sell health insurance in all states and the district of columbia  developing diverse member acquisition programs and establishing relationships with over leading insurance carriers  enabling us to offer thousands of health insurance plans online 
our ecommerce platform can be accessed directly through our website as well as through our network of marketing partners 
we generate revenue primarily from commissions we receive from health insurance carriers whose individual  family and small business policies are purchased through our ecommerce platform 
the commission payments we receive are typically a percentage of the premium on an individual  family or small business health insurance policy that we sold and are made to us on a monthly basis for as long as a policy remains active with us 
as a result  much of our revenue for a given financial reporting period relates to policies that we sold prior to the beginning of the period and is recurring in nature 
additionally  health insurance pricing  which is set by the health insurance carrier and approved by state regulators  is not subject to negotiation or discounting by health insurance carriers or our competitors 
in april  we acquired planprescriber  inc planprescriber  formerly experion systems  inc  a privately held company 
planprescriber is a leading provider of online tools to help seniors navigate medicare health insurance options 
we began actively marketing the availability of medicare related health insurance plans during through our online medicare plan platforms www 
ehealthmedicare 
com and www 
planprescriber 
com 
these platforms enable consumers to research and compare medicare related health insurance plans  including medicare advantage  medicare supplement and medicare part d prescription drug plans 
the revenue we have generated in our medicare plan business is primarily referral fees paid to us based on leads generated by our online platforms that are delivered and sold to third parties 
in we also launched online application capabilities for certain medicare plans  and telephonic enrollment capabilities through our new customer care center in salt lake city  utah 
to the extent that we assist in the sale of medicare related insurance plans as a health insurance agent  we generate revenue from commissions we receive from health insurance carriers 
we also derive revenue from licensing the use of our health insurance ecommerce technology 
our technology platform enables health insurance carriers and agents to market and distribute health insurance plans online 
health insurance carriers or agents that license our technology typically pay us implementation fees and performance based fees that are based on metrics such as submitted health insurance applications 
we also recently began to license our ecommerce technology for use by government agencies and intend to market it to states implementing health insurance exchanges as a result of health care reform legislation 
in our government technology licensing business  we may earn a combination of fixed license fees and time and materials based fees or we may be paid performance based fees 
in march  the federal patient protection and affordable care act and related amendments in the health care and education reconciliation act were signed into law 
these health care reform laws contain 
table of contents provisions that have and will continue to change the health insurance industry in substantial ways 
among several other provisions  they include a mandate requiring individuals to be insured or face tax penalties  a mandate that certain employers offer their employees group health insurance coverage or face tax penalties  prohibitions against insurance companies using pre existing health conditions as a reason to deny an application for health insurance  medical loss ratio requirements that require each health insurance carrier to spend a certain percentage of their premium revenue on reimbursement for clinical services and activities that improve health care quality  establishment of state and or federal health insurance exchanges to facilitate access to  and the purchase of  health insurance  and subsidies and cost sharing credits to make health insurance more affordable for those below certain income levels 
while many aspects of health care reform do not become effective until  health insurance carriers are required to maintain medical loss ratios of eighty percent in their individual and family health insurance business beginning in the implementation of the medical loss ratio requirements by insurance carriers has resulted in a reduction in the commission rates that we are paid as a result of our selling individual and family health insurance plans 
these reductions will begin to impact our individual and family health insurance plan commission based revenue starting in sources of revenue commission revenue we generate most of our revenue from commissions paid to us by health insurance carriers whose health insurance policies we have sold 
commission revenue represented  and of our total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our commission revenue generally represents a percentage of the insurance premium and  to a much lesser extent  commission override payments that insurance carriers pay us for achieving sales volume thresholds or other objectives 
commission rates vary by carrier and by the type of plan purchased by a member 
commission rates also can vary based upon the amount of time that the policy has been active  with commission rates for individual and family policies typically being higher in the first twelve months of the policy 
after the first twelve months  commission rates generally decline significantly 
as a result  if we do not add a sufficient number of members on new policies  our revenue growth will be negatively impacted 
individuals  families and small businesses purchasing health insurance through us typically pay their premiums on a monthly basis 
insurance carriers typically pay us our commissions monthly  after they receive the premium payment from the member 
for certain medicare health insurance policies  we receive an annual commission payment at the beginning of the policy year 
we generally continue to receive the commission payment from the relevant insurance carrier until the health insurance policy is cancelled or we otherwise do not remain the agent on the policy 
as a result  the majority of our revenue is recurring in nature and has grown in correlation with the growth we have experienced in our membership base 
our commission revenue has grown principally as a result of our penetration of the individual and family health insurance market and corresponding growth in our membership 
we estimate that as of december  we had approximately  members compared to an estimated  members at december  we define a member as an individual covered by an insurance plan for which we are entitled to receive compensation 
during the year ended december   we experienced a decrease in the number of applications submitted through us for individual and family health insurance  compared to the year ended december  during the year ended december   the number of individuals approved for individual and family major medical health insurance plans decreased over the number of individuals that were approved during the year ended december  we believe the decrease in the number of applications submitted through us for individual and family health insurance and in the number of individuals approved for individual and family major medical health insurance plans during was impacted by a number of factors  including consumer confusion related to the timing and impact of the federal health care reform legislation  weak 
table of contents macro economic conditions and the federal subsidy for health benefits under the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of cobra 
during the fourth quarter of  we believe that the number of individual and family submitted health insurance applications was further impacted by our decision to reduce our marketing and advertising spending in our online advertising channel relating to those plans and to redirect a portion of this expense to our medicare plan business 
individual and family health insurance submitted application volumes during the fourth quarter of were also impacted by several provisions of the federal patient protection and affordable care act that became effective in september  including certain minimum benefit requirements and prohibitions against insurance companies using pre existing health conditions as a reason to deny a health insurance application of a child under the age of as a result  health insurance carriers were making changes to their plans during the fourth quarter of  which decreased available plan inventory on our ecommerce platform 
we also believe our health insurance carrier partners adopted more stringent underwriting practices during we recognize commission revenue when commissions are reported to us by a health insurance carrier  net of an allowance for future forfeiture amounts payable to carriers due to policy cancellations 
commissions are reported to us by a cash payment and commission statement 
we generally receive these communications simultaneously 
in instances when we receive the cash payment and commission statement separately and in different accounting periods  we recognize revenue in the period that we receive the earliest communication  provided we receive the second corroborating communication within ten business days following the end of the accounting period 
if the second corroborating communication is not received within ten business days following the end of the accounting period  we recognize revenue in the period the second communication is received 
we use the data in the commission statements to help identify the members for which we are receiving a commission payment and the amount received for each member  and to estimate our allowance for forfeitures payable to carriers 
as a result  we recognize the net amount of compensation earned as the agent in the transaction 
commission override revenue  which we recognize on the same basis as premium commissions  is generally reported to us in a more irregular pattern than premium commissions 
as a result  our revenue for a particular quarter could be higher or lower than expectations due to the timing of the reporting of commission override revenue to us 
we began actively marketing the availability of medicare related health insurance plans during through our online medicare plan platforms www 
ehealthmedicare 
com and www 
planprescriber 
com 
these platforms enable consumers to research and compare medicare related health insurance plans  including medicare advantage  medicare supplement and medicare part d prescription drug plans 
while the revenue we have generated in our medicare plan business has been primarily referral fees paid to us based on leads generated by our online platforms  we also launched in online application capabilities for certain medicare plans and telephonic enrollment capabilities through our new customer care center in salt lake city  utah 
to the extent that we assist in the sale of medicare related insurance plans as a health insurance agent  we generate revenue from commissions we receive from health insurance carriers  and these medicare commissions are included in commission revenue 
revenue attributable to major medical individual and family health insurance plans represented approximately  and of our commission revenue in the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenue attributable to major medical individual and family health insurance plans in the year ended december  included a one time commission payment of million which we received from one of our health insurance carrier partners on a number of existing policies  in which all substantial services had been provided 
major medical individual and family health insurance plans do not include small business  short term  stand alone dental  life  student and medicare related health insurance plans 
in march  the federal patient protection and affordable care act and related amendments in the health care and education reconciliation act were signed into law 
among the many provisions included in these health care reform laws are medical loss ratio requirements that require each health insurance carrier to spend a certain percentage of their premium revenue on reimbursement for clinical services and activities that 
table of contents improve health care quality beginning in the implementation of the medical loss ratio requirements by insurance carriers has resulted in a reduction in the commission rates that we are paid as a result of our selling individual and family health insurance plans 
these reductions will begin to impact our individual and family health insurance plan commission based revenue starting in using data from the third quarter of  we estimate the amount by which our average individual and family plan base commission rate has changed to be a decline from just over of premium to just below 
the estimate of the change in the average rate is calculated by applying the changes in the first and subsequent year commission rates to our membership as of the end of the third quarter of  as if all changes were effective immediately for all individual and family health insurance plan members 
our estimate is revenue weighted so that a rate reduction implemented by a health insurance carrier with a larger member base with us had a larger impact on the resulting average rate than a change by a carrier with a smaller member base 
we also estimated changes for a minority of health insurance carriers which we believe had not completed a review of their commission rates 
the commission rate changes apply prospectively to applicable commissions earned on or after january  and the majority of the changes apply only to commissions earned on new members approved in and thereafter 
for the majority of members that were approved prior to the effective date of the commission rate changes  we will continue to be paid commissions at the rates in effect prior to the changes 
as a result  the new estimated average base commission rate computed above will phase in over time 
since the calculation is an estimate of the magnitude of the commission changes using our membership composition as of the end of the third quarter of  including the mix by health insurance carrier and plan for past sales  as well as the current mix of members between first year and renewal year  our actual future base commission rate will differ from the estimated rate 
the actual commission rate will depend on the mix of future approved members by state  health insurance carrier and plan and the mix between members approved prior to the commission rate changes and those approved after the changes  among other factors 
we also expect that in addition to the base commission rate changes  other programs that health insurance carriers have supported  such as commission overrides and sponsorship advertising programs  may be reduced as carriers work to comply with the new medical loss ratio requirements 
based on information currently available to us  we expect commission revenue to decrease in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue in compared to other revenue in addition to the commission revenue we derive from the sale of health insurance plans  we derive revenue from generating and delivering leads  primarily for medicare plans  from licensing the use of our ecommerce technology and from our online sponsorship and advertising program 
medicare lead referral 
our online medicare plan platforms www 
ehealthmedicare 
com and www 
planprescriber 
com  enable consumers to research and compare medicare related insurance plans  including medicare advantage  medicare supplement and medicare part d prescription drug plans 
the revenue we have generated in our medicare plan business is primarily referral fees paid to us based on leads generated by our online platforms that are delivered and sold to third parties 
the majority of our lead referral revenue occurs during the medicare annual enrollment period  which occurs during the fourth quarter of the calendar year 
technology licensing 
we derive revenue from licensing the use of our health insurance ecommerce technology 
our technology platform enables health insurance carriers and agents to market and distribute health insurance plans online 
in our technology licensing business  we are paid implementation fees and performance based fees that are based on metrics such as submitted health insurance applications 
typically  we are paid a one time implementation fee  which we recognize on a straight line basis over the estimated term of the customer relationship generally the initial term of the agreement  commencing once the technology is available for use by the third party 
in addition  we typically generate revenue based on performance criteria that are either measured based on data tracked by us  or based on data tracked by the third party 
in instances where the performance criteria data are tracked by us  we recognize revenue in the period of performance 
in instances where the performance criteria data are tracked by the third party  we recognize revenue when the amounts earned are both 
table of contents fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
typically  this occurs through our receipt of a cash payment from the third party along with a detailed statement containing the data that is tracked by the third party 
we recently began to license our ecommerce technology for use by government agencies and intend to market it to states implementing health insurance exchanges as a result of health care reform legislation 
in our government technology licensing business  we may earn a combination of fixed license fees and time and materials based fees or we may be paid performance based fees 
we were recently awarded a contract from the federal government to provide technology and information services relating to the federal government s healthcare reform website 
revenue from this contract is being recognized on a straight line basis from the date our technology was available for use by the federal government to the end of the initial one year term of the contract 
the contract is renewable annually for up to three years  at the option of the federal government 
online sponsorship and advertising 
we derive revenue from our online sponsorship advertising program that allows carriers to purchase advertising space in specific markets in a sponsorship area on our website 
in return  we are typically paid a monthly fee and a performance based fee based on metrics such as submitted health insurance applications 
based on information currently available to us  we expect other revenue to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue in compared to as a result of growth in our technology licensing business  as well as growth in revenue derived from fees paid to us through the generation and delivery of leads  primarily for medicare related insurance plans 
member acquisition an important factor in our revenue growth is the growth of our member base 
our marketing initiatives are an important component of our strategy to grow our member base and are focused on three primary member acquisition channels direct  marketing partners and online advertising 
our marketing initiatives are primarily designed to encourage consumers to complete an online application for health insurance on our ecommerce platform 
in addition  we may refer medicare eligible individuals to third parties who may assist them in enrolling in a medicare plan 
our marketing channels are as follows direct 
our direct member acquisition channel consists of consumers who access our website addresses www 
ehealth 
com  www 
ehealthinsurance 
com  www 
ehealthmedicare 
com and www 
planprescriber 
com either directly or through algorithmic natural search listings on internet search engines and directories 
for each of the years ended december   and  applications submitted through us for individual and family health insurance from our direct channel constituted  and  respectively  of all individual and family health insurance applications submitted on our website 
marketing partners 
our marketing partner member acquisition channel consists of consumers who access our websites through a network of affiliate partners and financial services and other companies 
growth in our marketing partner channel depends upon our expanding marketing programs with existing partners and adding new partners to our network 
for the years ended december   and  applications submitted through us for individual and family health insurance plans from our marketing partner member acquisition channel constituted approximately  and  respectively  of all individual and family health insurance applications submitted on our website 
online advertising 
our online advertising member acquisition channel consists of consumers who access our websites through paid keyword search advertising from search engines such as google  msn and yahoo  as well as various internet marketing programs such as banner advertising and email marketing 
for the years ended december   and  applications submitted through us for individual and family health insurance plans from our online advertising channel constituted approximately  and  respectively  of all individual and family health insurance applications submitted on our website 

table of contents operating costs and expenses cost of revenue cost of revenue consists of payments related to health insurance policies sold to members who were referred to our website by marketing partners with whom we have revenue sharing arrangements 
cost of revenue also includes direct labor and other direct costs incurred in connection with our contract with the federal government  as well as the amortization of consideration we paid to certain brokers in connection with the transfer of their health insurance members to us as the new broker of record on the underlying policies 
in order to enter into a revenue sharing arrangement  marketing partners must be licensed to sell health insurance in the state where the policy is sold 
costs related to revenue sharing arrangements are expensed as the related revenue is recognized 
initial direct labor and other direct costs incurred in connection with our contract with the federal government  but prior to the availability of our technology for use by the federal government  were deferred and included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  and are being amortized to cost of revenue from the date our technology was available for use by the federal government to the end of the initial one year term of the contract 
in february  we entered into customer transition and marketing agreements with health benefits direct corporation hbdc 
pursuant to the agreements  hbdc agreed to transfer to us certain of its existing health insurance members  all of which were members on individual and family major medical policies  as the new broker of record on the underlying policies and agreed to refer future health insurance prospects to us 
we paid hbdc initial consideration of million  which is being amortized to cost of revenue as we recognize commission revenue related to the transferred members 
in addition  we agreed to pay hbdc a percentage of the commission revenue we receive on the transferred policies  as well as a percentage of the future commission revenue we receive on health insurance policies we sell to prospects hbdc refers to us 
the ongoing revenue sharing payments are recorded as cost of revenue expense when we recognize the related revenue 
in november  we entered into an agreement with a partner  whereby the partner transferred certain of its existing medicare insurance members to us as the broker of record on the underlying policies 
total consideration of million is being amortized to cost of revenue as we recognize commission revenue related to the transferred members over a period of up to five years 
of the million total consideration  million was paid to the partner in november and million is payable in february and is recorded in accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  we expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars in compared to due to a full year of direct labor and other direct costs incurred in connection with our performance under our contract with the federal government and an expected increase in the amount of revenue sharing expense related to partners 
marketing and advertising marketing and advertising expenses consist primarily of member acquisition expenses associated with our direct  marketing partner and online advertising member acquisition channels  in addition to compensation and other expenses related to marketing  business development  partner management  public relations and carrier relations personnel who support our offerings 
our direct channel expenses primarily consist of costs for television advertising  radio advertising  print advertising  direct mail and email marketing 
our marketing partner channel expenses consist primarily of fees paid to marketing partners with which we have a relationship 
we compensate a significant number of our marketing partners by paying a fee each time a consumer referral from a partner results in a submitted health insurance application on our ecommerce platform  regardless of whether the consumer s application is approved by the health insurance carrier 
many of our marketing partners have tiered arrangements in which the amount of the fee increases as the volume of submitted applications we receive from the marketing partner increases over a particular period 
we recognize these expenditures in the period when a marketing partner s referral results in the submission of a health insurance application on our website 
the number of individual and family health insurance applications submitted through 
table of contents our ecommerce platform has generally increased in our first quarter compared to our fourth quarter and in our third quarter compared to our second quarter 
conversely  we have generally experienced a decline or flattening in individual and family submitted applications in our second quarter compared to our first quarter and in our fourth quarter compared to our third quarter 
since a significant portion of our marketing and advertising expenses are driven by the number of health insurance applications submitted on our website  those expenses are influenced by these patterns 
in addition  because the total volume of submitted applications that we receive from our marketing partners is largely outside of our control  particularly during any short term period  and because of our tiered marketing partner arrangements  we could incur expenses in excess of  or below  the amounts we had planned in periods of rapid change in the volume of submitted applications from marketing partner referrals 
an unanticipated increase in submitted applications resulting from marketing partner referrals could cause our net income to be lower than our expectation  since the revenue to be derived from submitted applications that are approved by health insurance carriers will not be recognized until future periods 
paid keyword search advertising on search engines represents the majority of expenses in our online advertising channel 
we incur expenses associated with search engine advertising in the period in which the consumer clicks on the advertisement 
similar to our marketing partner channel  expenses in our online advertising channel will increase or decrease in relation to any increase or decrease in consumers referred to our website as a result of such search engine advertising 
for example  due to the substantial increase in the number of consumers referred to our website from paid keyword search advertising performed during the medicare annual enrollment period  we experienced a significant increase in our medicare online marketing expenses during our fourth quarter of we expect our marketing and advertising expenses to decrease in absolute dollars in compared to primarily due to an expected decline in costs related to paid keyword search advertising during as a result of the lower lifetime value of an individual and family health insurance member 
the decline in paid search advertising is expected to be partially offset by increased marketing and advertising expenses related to our medicare plan and government system businesses 
customer care and enrollment customer care and enrollment expenses primarily consist of compensation and benefits costs for personnel engaged in pre sales assistance to applicants who call our customer care center and for enrollment personnel who assist applicants during the underwriting process 
we expect customer care and enrollment expenses to increase in absolute dollars in compared to as a result of additional personnel and expenditures necessary to develop future medicare plan sales capabilities  as well as costs related to our new customer care center in salt lake city  utah 
technology and content technology and content expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits costs for personnel associated with developing and enhancing our website technology as well as maintaining our website 
a majority of our technology and content group is located at our wholly owned subsidiary in china  where technology development costs are generally lower than in the united states 
we expect technology and content expenses to increase in absolute dollars in compared to due to our continued focus on technology development  technology licensing implementations  an increase in technology and content employees and the enhancement of our current ecommerce platform for medicare related insurance plans 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses include compensation and benefits costs for staff working in our executive  finance  corporate development  investor relations  government relations  legal  human resources  internal audit  facilities and internal information technology departments 
these expenses also include fees paid 
table of contents for outside professional services  including audit  tax  legal and information technology fees 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars in compared to due to the increased costs necessary to support the future growth of our business 
amortization of acquired intangible assets acquired intangible assets with finite useful lives  which include purchased technology  pharmacy and customer relationships  trade names  trademarks and website addresses  are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable

our insurance carrier partners bill and collect insurance premiums paid by our members 
carrier partners do not report to us the number of members that we have as of a given date 
the majority of our members who terminate their policies do so by discontinuing their premium payments to the carrier and do not inform us of the cancellation 
also  some of our members pay their premiums less frequently than monthly 
given the number of months required to observe non payment of commissions in order to confirm cancellations  we estimate the number of members who are active on insurance policies as of a specified date 
we estimate the number of continuing members on non small business insurance policies as of a specific date by taking the sum of i the number of members for whom we have received a commission payment for the month that is six months or three months in the case of short term  student and dental insurance prior to the date of estimation after reducing that number using historical experience for assumed member cancellations over  as applicable  the three month or six month period  and ii the number of approved members over the six month period or three months in the case of short term  student and dental insurance prior to the date of estimation after reducing that number using historical experience for an assumed number of members who do not accept their approved policy and for estimated member cancellations through the date of the estimate 
we estimate the number of small business group members using the number of initial members at the time the group is approved  and we update this number for changes in membership if such changes are reported to us by the group or carrier in the period it is reported 
however  groups generally notify the carrier directly of policy cancellations and increases or decreases in group size without informing us 
additionally  our carrier partners often do not communicate this information to us 
we often are made aware of policy cancellations at the time of annual renewal and update our membership statistics accordingly in the period they are reported 
after we have estimated membership for a period  we may receive information from health insurance carriers that would have impacted the estimate if we had received the information prior to the date of estimation 
we may receive commission payments or other information that indicates that a member who was not included in our estimates for a prior period was in fact an active member at that time  or that a member who was included in our estimates was in fact not an active member of ours 
for instance  we reconcile information carriers provide to us and may determine that we were not historically paid commissions owed to us  which would cause us to have underestimated our membership 
conversely  carriers may require us to return commission payments paid in a prior period due to policy cancellations for members we previously estimated as being active 
we reflect updated information regarding our membership in the membership estimate for the current period that we are estimating  if applicable 
as a result of the delay in our receipt of information from insurance carriers  actual trends in our membership are most discernable over periods longer than from one quarter to the next 
in addition  and as a result of the delay we experience in receiving information about our membership  it is difficult for us to determine with any certainty the impact of current economic and other conditions on our membership retention 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of 
table of contents contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to  but not limited to  allowances for commission forfeitures payable to carriers  the assumptions used in determining stock based compensation  the useful lives of long lived assets including property and equipment and intangible assets  fair value of intangible assets  valuation allowance for deferred income taxes  provision for income taxes and fair value of investments 
we base our estimates of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
in many cases  we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates 
in some cases  changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition commission revenue 
we recognize commission revenue when our commission is reported to us by a health insurance carrier  net of an allowance for future forfeiture amounts payable to carriers due to policy cancellations 
commissions are reported to us by a cash payment and commission statement 
we generally receive these communications simultaneously 
in instances when we receive the cash payment and commission statement separately and in different accounting periods  we recognize revenue in the period that we receive the earliest communication  provided we receive the second corroborating communication within ten business days following the end of the accounting period 
if the second corroborating communication is not received within ten business days following the end of the accounting period  we recognize revenue in the period the second communication is received 
we use the data in the commission statements to help identify the members for which we are receiving a commission payment and the amount received for each member  and to estimate our allowance for forfeitures payable to carriers 
as a result  we recognize the net amount of compensation earned as the agent in the transaction 
our insurance carrier partners bill and collect insurance premiums that our members pay 
we rely on health insurance carriers to report accurately and in a timely manner the amount of commissions earned by us  and we calculate our commission revenues  prepare our financial reports  projections and budgets  and direct our marketing and other operating efforts based on the reports we receive from them 
each month we analyze the reports we receive from health insurance carriers by comparing them to the database we maintain on our members 
it is often difficult for us to independently determine whether or not carriers are reporting all commissions due to us  primarily because the majority of our members who terminate their policies do so by discontinuing their premium payments to the carrier instead of by informing us of the cancellation 
also  some of our members pay their premiums less frequently than monthly 
this results in our having to identify underpayment or non payment of commissions on a policy and follow up with a carrier to obtain an explanation and or request correction of the amount of commissions paid to us 
to the extent that carriers understate or fail to timely and accurately report or pay the amount of commissions due to us  we will not collect and recognize revenue to which we are entitled  which  if material in amount  would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
commission override revenue  which we recognize on the same basis as premium commissions  is generally reported to us in a more irregular pattern than premium commissions 
as a result  our revenues for a particular quarter could be higher or lower than expectations due to the timing of the reporting of commission override revenue to us 
certain commission amounts are subject to forfeiture in circumstances where a member has prepaid his or her premium for a future period of coverage and subsequently cancels his or her policy before the completion of that period 
we estimate and record an allowance for these forfeitures based on historical cancellation experience using data provided on commission statements 
the forfeitures are typically reported to us by health insurance 
table of contents carriers one to two months after the commission is reported and paid to us by the carrier 
our estimate of the allowance for forfeitures includes an estimate of both the reporting time lag and the forfeiture amount 
changes in our historical trends would result in changes to our estimated forfeitures in future periods 
there were no changes in our average forfeiture rates or reporting time lag during the years ended december   and which had a material impact on our allowance for forfeitures 
other revenue 
we recognize lead referral revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of a lead has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
delivery is deemed to have occurred at the time a lead is delivered to the customer 
our commercial technology licensing business allows carriers the use of our ecommerce platform to offer their own health insurance policies on their websites and agents to utilize our technology to power their online quoting  content and application submission processes 
typically  we are paid a one time implementation fee  which we recognize on a straight line basis over the estimated term of the customer relationship generally the initial term of the agreement  commencing once the technology is available for use by the third party  and a performance fee based on metrics such as submitted health insurance applications 
the metrics used to calculate performance fees for both sponsorship advertising and technology licensing are based on performance criteria that are either measured based on data tracked by us  or based on data tracked by the third party 
in instances where the performance criteria data is tracked by us  we recognize revenue in the period of performance 
in instances where the performance criteria data is tracked by the third party  we recognize revenue when the amounts earned are both fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
typically  this occurs through our receipt of a cash payment from the third party along with a detailed statement containing the data that is tracked by the third party 
in addition  we have begun to license our technology to government agency customers and we were recently awarded a contract from the federal government to provide technology and information services relating to the federal government s healthcare reform website 
our contract with the federal government to provide technology and information services relating to the federal government s healthcare reform website is a multiple element arrangement 
we were not able to establish fair value for each element within the contract and  therefore  accounted for the entire contract as one unit of accounting 
we deferred all revenue related to the contract until our technology was available for use by the federal government 
revenue is being recognized on a straight line basis from the date our technology was available for use by the federal government to the end of the initial one year term of the contract 
the contract is renewable annually for up to three additional years  at the option of the federal government 
our sponsorship advertising program allows carriers to purchase advertising space in specific markets in a sponsorship area on our website 
in return  we are typically paid a monthly fee  which is recognized over the period that advertising is displayed  and often a performance fee based on metrics such as submitted health insurance applications 
deferred revenue consists of deferred technology licensing implementation fees as well as amounts billed or collected from sponsorship or technology licensing customers in advance of our performing our service for such customers 
it also includes the amount by which both unbilled and billed services provided under our federal government contract exceed the straight line revenue recognized to date 
we defer commission amounts that have been paid to us related to transactions where our services are complete  but where we cannot currently estimate the allowance for future forfeitures related to those amounts 

table of contents stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income based on the fair value of our stock based awards over their respective vesting periods  which is generally four years 
the estimated grant date fair value of our stock based awards is determined using the black scholes merton pricing model and a single option award approach 
the weighted average expected term for stock options granted is calculated using the simplified method  as we do not have sufficient historical option exercise behavior on which to estimate expected terms 
the simplified method defines the expected term as the average of the contractual term and the vesting period of the stock option 
we have estimated the volatility used as an input to the model based on an analysis of our stock price since our initial public offering in october  as well as an analysis of similar public companies for which we have data 
we estimate our expected volatility using the weighted average of our implied volatility  our mean reversion volatility  and the mean reversion volatility of similar public companies for which we have data 
we have used judgment in selecting these companies  as well as evaluating the available historical and implied volatility data for these companies 
the dividend yield is determined by dividing the expected per share dividend during the coming year by the grant date stock price 
through december   we had not declared or paid any cash dividends  and we do not expect to pay any in the foreseeable future 
we base the risk free interest rate on the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term of our stock options 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
we will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected term and volatility related to our own stock based awards on a prospective basis  and incorporating these factors into the model 
changes in key assumptions will significantly impact the valuation of such instruments 
future stock based compensation expense is dependent upon the fair value of each option at the date each option is granted and the number of awards issued and outstanding during each period 
we expect stock based compensation expense will increase in the future to the extent the number of equity awards issued and outstanding increases 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the consideration paid over the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business acquisition 
we do not amortize goodwill but test for impairment on an annual basis on or about november of each year and whenever we become aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that would indicate a reduction in its fair value below its carrying amount 
acquired intangible assets with finite useful lives  which include purchased technology  pharmacy and customer relationships  trade names  trademarks and website addresses  are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment annually on or about november of each year or when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable 
factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends or significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets 
we measure the recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows 
if an asset grouping s carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows  the asset grouping is considered to be impaired 
the impairment is measured by comparing the difference between the asset grouping s carrying value and its fair value 
fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
goodwill and intangible assets are considered non financial assets  and are recorded at fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized 

table of contents we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings 
in addition  we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets with finite useful lives 
when we determine that the useful life of an asset is shorter than we had originally estimated  we accelerate the rate of amortization over the assets new  remaining useful life 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method 
deferred income taxes are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
since tax laws and financial accounting standards differ in their recognition and measurement of assets  liabilities  equity  revenues  expenses  gains and losses  differences arise between the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and between the tax bases of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in our financial statements 
because we assume that the reported amounts of assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled  respectively  a difference between the tax basis of an asset or a liability and its reported amount in the balance sheet will result in a taxable or a deductible amount in some future years when the related liabilities are settled or the reported amounts of the assets are recovered  which gives rise to a deferred tax asset or liability 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery does not meet the more likely than not criteria  we must establish a valuation allowance 
management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences that may result in deferred tax assets  as well as discrete tax items during the period  such as excess tax benefits related to share based payments 
assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon several factors  including the likelihood and amount  if any  of future taxable income in relevant jurisdictions during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we forecast taxable income by considering all available positive and negative evidence  including our history of operating income and losses and our financial plans and estimates that we use to manage the business 
these assumptions require significant judgment about future taxable income 
as a result  the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income change 
future changes in various factors  such as the amount of stock based compensation we record during the period and the related tax benefit we realize upon the exercise of employee stock options  potential limitations on the use of our federal and state net operating loss credit carry forwards  pending or future tax law changes including rate changes and the tax benefit from or limitations on our ability to utilize research and development credits  the amount of non deductible lobbying and acquisition related costs  changes in our valuation allowance and state and foreign taxes  would impact our estimates  and as a result  could affect our effective tax rate and the amount of income tax expense we record  and pay  in future periods

the timing of the recognition of our commission revenue depends upon the timing of our receipt of commission reports and associated commission payments from health insurance carriers 
if we were to experience a delay in receiving a commission payment from a health insurance carrier at the end of a quarter  our operating cash flows for that quarter could be negatively impacted 
additionally  commission override payments are reported to us in a more irregular pattern than premium commissions 
for example  a carrier may make a commission override payment to us on an annual basis  which would positively impact our cash flows in the quarter the payment is received 
the majority of our annual commission override payments are typically received during the first quarter of the year 
historically  we have experienced a reduction in operating cash flows during the first quarter of the year due to the payment of annual performance bonuses to employees 
in addition  a significant portion of our marketing and advertising expenses are driven by the number of health insurance applications submitted on our ecommerce platform 
since our marketing and advertising costs are expensed as incurred and the revenue from approved applications is recognized as commissions are subsequently reported to us  our operating cash flows could be negatively impacted by a substantial increase in the volume of applications submitted during a quarter or positively impacted by a substantial decline in the volume of applications submitted during a quarter 
starting with the fourth quarter of we began to experience seasonality impacting the timing of our cash flow resulting from our medicare plan related activities 
in our medicare plan business  we generate the majority of referral fees during the fourth quarter 
we also incur a significant portion of our medicare plan related marketing expenses during the fourth quarter 
we may not be paid for a considerable portion of the referral fees owed to us until the first quarter
