item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report contains our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and and data derived therefrom 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to historical financial information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report  particularly in item a 
risk factors above 
overview we are a leading producer and distributor of milk powder  soybean milk powder  and related dairy products in the prc 
using proprietary processing techniques  we make products that are specially formulated for particular ages  dietary needs and health concerns 
we have over company owned milk collection stations  seven production and distribution facilities with an aggregate milk powder production capacity of  tons per day  and an extensive distribution network that reaches over  retail outlets throughout china 
factors affecting our results of operations our operating results are primarily affected by the following factors dairy industry growth 
we believe the market for dairy products in china for the long term will be growing rapidly  driven by china s economic growth  increased penetration of infant formula  and a growing female working population 
despite the damage to the industry as a result of the melamine crisis in  we expect these factors to continue to drive industry growth 
we believe that the rapid economic growth of our primary markets has become an increasingly important driver of growth 
production capacity 
we believe much of the dairy market in china is still underserved  particularly with respect to infant formula 
in addition  since the melamine crisis in  which did not involve any of our products  we have at times operated our milk production facilities at maximum capacity 
accordingly  we believe that the ability to increase production of high quality dairy products will allow well positioned companies to significantly increase revenues and market share 
perceptions of product quality and safety 
we believe that rising consumer wealth in china has contributed to a greater demand for higher priced products with perceived quality advantages 
we believe many consumers in china tend to regard higher prices as indicative of higher quality and higher nutritional value  particularly in the areas of infant formula and nutritional products 
accordingly  we believe our reputation for quality and safety allows us to command higher average selling prices and generate higher gross margins than competitors who do not possess the same reputation 
conversely  any decrease in consumer perceptions of quality and safety could adversely impact us 
seasonality 
the dairy industry remains seasonal  with higher production in the summer season and greater demand in winter months 
this seasonality is offset by production of powder products with longer shelf lives 
raw material supply and prices 
the per unit costs of producing our infant formula are subject to the supply and price volatility of raw milk and other raw materials  which are affected by the prc and global markets 
for example  in our raw milk prices increased by approximately  in decreased by approximately and in increased by approximately and we expect they will continue to be affected by factors such as geographic location  rising feed prices  general economic conditions such as inflation and fuel prices  and fluctuations in production  rising production costs and competition  as well as increased competition abroad and currency fluctuations 
expenses associated with expansion and competition 
in implementing our plan to expand our business  we face corresponding increases in expenses  especially for sales and marketing expenses  in order to attract and retain qualified talent  monitor our sales by region and address potential cross territory selling activities by distributors  implement strategic advertising campaigns  and finance our expansion 
we have two reportable segments dairy products and dairy farm 
our dairy products segment produces and sells dairy products  such as wholesale and retail milk powders  as well as soybean powder  rice cereal  walnut powder and walnut oil 
our dairy farm segment operates our two company owned dairy farms  gannan farms and kedong farms  construction of which we completed in the fourth quarter of our dairy farms provide milk to us and normally do not provide milk to external customers

sales decreased by approximately million  or  from approximately million in to approximately million in this decrease was primarily attributable to decrease of sales of milk powder  offset in part by an increase in sales of raw milk powder  which reflected the fact that there were new competitors entering into our industry and old competitors aggressively attempting to reclaim market share following the melamine crisis 
during  we focused on improving sales of existing sales points and  accordingly  our expansion into new market areas was less rapid 
while our full year sales decreased  our sales in the quarterly period ended december  increased by approximately million  or  from approximately million in the quarterly period ended december  to approximately million in the quarterly period ended december  we believe this increase reflects our improved control of cross territory selling activities by distributors  as well as our sales of excess inventory as lower margin raw milk powder in an effort to manage inventory levels which occurred during the fourth quarter of our inventories increased approximately million  or  from approximately million as of december  to approximately million as of december   reflecting our increased production during our first and second fiscal quarters of to prepare to meet expected sales demand

general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or  from approximately million for to million for the increase was primarily attributable to an increase of approximately million  or  in staff salary and welfare contributions and an increase of approximately million  or in travelling and office administrative expenses 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease of approximately million  or  in professional service fees 
general and administrative expenses are likely to increase as we continue to expand our production  sourcing capacity  and distribution capacity throughout china 
goodwill impairment expense 
we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million  an increase of approximately million or  from approximately million in  related to shanxi feihe as a result of the stagnating growth of our walnut powder products 
as a result  goodwill related to shanxi feihe has been reduced to nil 
loss on disposal of biological assets 
our loss on disposal of biological assets increased by approximately million  or  from approximately million in to approximately million in the increase reflects our sale of under producing cows at our company owned dairy farms

our net income from discontinued operations decreased by approximately million  or  from approximately million in to nil in comparison of years ended december  and sales our sales consist primarily of revenues generated from sales of milk powder  raw milk powder  soybean powder  rice cereal  and walnut products 
sales increased by approximately million  or  from approximately million in to approximately million in this increase was primarily attributable to expanding our market areas and distribution network throughout china  increased demand for high quality products and strong market acceptance of these products  and increased sales quantities of several high profit margin products 
while our full year sales increased  our sales in the quarterly period ended december  decreased by approximately million  or  from approximately million in the quarterly period ended december  to approximately million in the quarterly period ended december  we believe this decrease reflects the impact of cross territory selling activities by distributors  as well as our sales of excess inventory as lower margin raw milk powder in an effort to manage inventory levels 
our inventories increased approximately million  or  from approximately million as of december  to approximately million as of december   reflecting our increased production during our first and second fiscal quarters of to prepare to meet expected sales demand during our third and fourth fiscal quarters of the following table sets forth information regarding the sales of our principal products during the fiscal years ended december  and over product name quantity kg amount of sales quantity kg amount of sales quantity kg amount of sales milk powder raw milk powder soybean powder rice cereal walnut products other total while full year sales of our higher margin milk powder products increased  our milk powder sales in the quarterly period ended december  decreased by approximately million  from approximately million  or of total sales  in the quarterly period ended december   to approximately million or of total sales  in the quarterly period ended december  this shift in product mix reflects our sales of excess inventory as lower margin raw milk powder in an effort to manage inventory levels 
in  we also experienced an increase in the average sales price per kilogram of our products  as demonstrated in the table below sales revenues in thousands total sales volume kilograms in thousands average selling prices kilogram the increase in average sales price per kilogram  as reflected in the table  is relatively small and primarily attributable to the shift in product mix to higher end products rather than an increase in the sales price of individual products

capital expenditures for the years ended december   and amounted approximately to million  million and million  respectively 
our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers 
we have been able to meet our cash needs principally by using cash on hand  cash flows from operations  bank loans  proceeds from the sale of securities and borrowings under our line of credit

our summary cash flow information is as follows year ended december net cash provided by used in in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year decreased approximately million  from net cash provided by operating activities of approximately million in to approximately million in this decrease was primarily attributable to the following changes in working capital items increase in inventory purchases of approximately million reflecting our increased production in preparation to meet expected sales demand  increase in advances to suppliers of approximately million as a result of increased production combined with the rising costs of raw material  especially purchased raw milk powder which prices increased approximately in  increased payment of approximately million in notes payable primarily as a result of increased inventory purchases  decrease of government subsidies of approximately million as a significant amount of government subsidy received in was related to the longjiang feihe acquisition  and increase of approximately million in advances from customers for raw milk powder primarily attributable to increased sales of raw milk powder despite an overall decrease in sales 
for the year ended december  net income increased by approximately million  while net cash provided by operating activities increased approximately million  from approximately million in to approximately million in due to the following changes in working capital items decrease of inventory purchases of approximately million partially offset by decrease in accounts payable of million as compared with because we intended to significantly expand the business in and believed our competitive position following the melamine crisis was favorable  we purchased significant amounts of raw material and accordingly produced increased levels of inventory in although our business plan in still includes expansion  we have shifted our product mix to higher margin milk powder and therefore sold off excess inventory at lower margins to stabilize our inventory levels  increase in trade receivables of approximately million primarily due to increases in sales of higher margin products in addition to our expansion within china during as compared to in  we also increased credit limits available to long term customers  although we continue to require advance payments from new customers  decrease in advances from customers of approximately million  which reflected a higher balance of advance from distributors at the year end of  ordering sufficient milk powder to meet the increased needs of first quarter s sales which was a direct result of the melamine crisis  increase in amounts due to related parties of approximately million  relating to the advance received from one related company for the purchase of cattle  and increase in advances to suppliers of approximately million relating to our upcoming productions in the first half of to meet our increasing demands in the winter season 
additionally  costs of raw material in have increased compared to net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities decreased approximately million  from approximately million in to approximately million in this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in purchase of property and equipment of approximately million  a decrease in purchase of biological assets of approximately million  an increase in the proceeds from sales of biological assets of approximately million and purchase of our longjiang feihe dairy operations for approximately million in this decrease was offset in part by an increase in restricted cash of approximately million and proceeds from sale of a subsidiary of approximately million

the loans were secured by pledges of certain fixed assets held by our subsidiaries or by guarantees of certain of our subsidiaries 
our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness depends in part on the value of our assets  which depends  in turn  on the strength of our cash flows  results of operations  economic and market conditions and other factors 
line of credit we also have a one year  unsecured line of credit with a bank of approximately million rmb million scheduled to expire in the last fiscal quarter of the line of credit entitles us to draw demand loans for general corporate purposes

we believe this data includes all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation 
you should read the quarterly data in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
the consolidated results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period 
we expect that our quarterly revenues may fluctuate significantly 
for our and fiscal years  our quarterly results of operations were summarized as follows three months ended unaudited fiscal december september june march us us us us sales gross profit net income loss from continuing operations  net of tax net income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net income loss attributable to feihe international  inc earnings per share basic net income loss from continuing operations net income from discontinued operations net income loss earnings per share diluted net income loss from continuing operations net income from discontinued operations net income loss earnings per redeemable common share basic net income loss from continuing operations net income from discontinued operations net income loss earnings per redeemable common share diluted net income loss from continuing operations net income from discontinued operations net income loss three months ended unaudited fiscal december september june march us us us us sales gross loss profit net loss income from continuing operations net income from discontinued operations net loss income attributable to feihe international  inc earnings per share basic net loss income from continuing operations net income from discontinued operations net loss income earnings per share diluted net loss income from continuing operations net income from discontinued operations net loss income earnings per redeemable common stock basic net loss income from continuing operations net income from discontinued operations net loss income earnings per redeemable common share diluted net loss income from continuing operations net income from discontinued operations net loss income off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any transactions  agreements or other contractual arrangements to which an entity unconsolidated with us is a party and under which we have i any obligation under a guarantee  ii any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support to such entity  iii any obligation under derivative instruments that are indexed to our shares and classified as shareholders equity in our consolidated balance sheets  or iv any obligation arising out of a variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing  hedging or research and development services with us 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of us and our subsidiaries 
all transactions and balances among us and our subsidiaries have been eliminated upon consolidation 
certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for assets and liabilities  our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
we routinely evaluate these estimates  utilizing historical experience  consulting with experts and utilizing other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
estimates of allowances for bad debts we periodically review our trade and other receivables to determine if all are collectible or whether an allowance is required for possible uncollectible balances 
we perform this review quarterly  and in determining the allowances  a number of factors are considered  including the length of time the receivable is past due  past loss history  the counter party s current ability to pay and the general condition of the economy and industry 
as a result of this review and collection of older receivables  we have reduced our estimated allowance for bad debts by  for the year ended december  and reduced it by  for the year ended december  although our write offs of bad debts have been minimal in recent years and we had no write off in the year ended december   events and circumstances could occur that would require that we increase our allowance in the future 
estimate of the useful lives of property and equipment and biological assets we estimate the useful lives and residual values of our property and equipment and biological assets 
we also review property and equipment and biological assets for possible impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recovered from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition 
we recognized no impairments in the years ended december  and for our cows included in the biological assets  we regularly monitor their production level and intend to dispose of under producing cows 
we recognized approximately million and million of loss on such disposal in fiscal year and  respectively 
inventory we value inventories at the lower of cost or market value 
we determine the cost of inventories using the weighted average cost method and include any related production overhead costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition 
we determine whether we have any excessive  slow moving  obsolete or impaired inventory 
we perform this review quarterly  which requires management to estimate the future demand of our products and market conditions 
we make provisions on the value of inventories at period end equal to the difference between the cost and the estimated market value 
if actual market conditions change  additional provisions may be required 
goodwill we test goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired 
we currently have ten reporting units and only two reporting units carry assigned goodwill shanxi feihe and gannan feihe 
we perform annual impairment test on december on the two reporting units 
we recognize a goodwill impairment loss in our statements of operations when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value which is based on their undiscounted cash flows 
these analyses require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment  including forecasting future sales  expenses  and discount rates  which can be affected by economic conditions and other factors that can be difficult to predict 
we perform the impairment test at the end of the fourth quarter each year 
as a result of this impairment testing  we recognized  and  in goodwill impairment expense for the years ended december  and  respectively  reducing the carrying value of goodwill related to shanxi feihe to nil as of december  for additional details  see note to the audited consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of goods is recognized on the transfer of risks and rewards of ownership  which generally coincides with the time when the goods are shipped to customers and the title has passed 
revenue is shown net of sales returns  which amounted to less than of total sales in each of the years ended december   and  and net of sales discounts  which are determined based on our distributors sales volumes 
share based compensation share based compensation to employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instrument as at the date of grant using the black scholes model  which requires assumptions for dividend yield  expected volatility and expected life of stock options 
the expected life of stock options is estimated by observing general option holder behavior 
the assumption of the expected volatility has been set by reference to the implied volatility of our shares in the open market and historical patterns of volatility 
performance and service vesting conditions attached to the options are included in assumptions about the number of shares that the option holder will ultimately receive 
on a regular basis we review the assumptions made and revise the estimates of the number of options expected to be settled  where necessary 
significant factors affecting the fair value of option awards include the estimated future volatility of our stock price and the estimated expected term until the option award is exercised or cancelled 
the fair value of awards is amortized over the requisite service period  except for  options granted in may that vest upon performance conditions 
for such performance based awards  we assess the probability of meeting such conditions in order to determine the compensation cost to be recognized 
for the years ended december  and  we determined that it was improbable for the performance targets to be met for the performance awards 
total compensation expense recognized in general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and  were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
redeemable common stock the value of redeemable common stock is measured at the fair value on the date of issuance 
when and if the redemption right expires  the common stock will be classified as permanent shareholders equity 
however  should the terms of the redemption change making it mandatory for us to redeem the common stock  such common stock will be reclassified to liabilities at its fair value with any differences between fair value and carrying value recognized in equity 
we assess the probability of redemption and accrue proper accretion on a quarterly basis 
until management determines it is probable that the common stock will become redeemable  the change in the redemption value is not accreted 
at issuance  we determined that the contractual arrangement pursuant to which we issued the redeemable common stock contained an embedded derivative whereby additional shares would be granted should we fail to meet certain performance targets  which was bifurcated from the host and recorded at fair value 
as of december   such performance targets were not attained and we recorded a loss of approximately million for the difference in the fair value of the additional shares as a result of the performance adjustment and the initial fair value of the embedded derivative 
on february   we entered into a redemption agreement committing us to redeem the common stock at a total price of million plus annual compounded interest  beginning from august  we agreed to consummate the redemption in four closings from march  through march  as of december  we considered redemption to be probable and accreted the redeemable common stock to its redemption value of approximately million as of december  taxation current income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws of the relevant tax authorities

net operating loss carry forwards and credits are applied using enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current and non current based on their characteristics 
we adopted asc  income taxes previously fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin effective april  in accordance with asc  we recognize a tax benefit associated with an uncertain tax position when  in our judgment  it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority 
for a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold  we initially and subsequently measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that we judge to have a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority 
our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances  such as the progress of tax audits  case law developments and new or emerging legislation 
such adjustments are recognized entirely in the period in which they are identified 
our effective tax rate includes the net impact of changes in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits and subsequent adjustments as considered appropriate by management 
we classify interest and penalties recognized on the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board  or the fasb  issued authoritative guidance to improve disclosures about fair value measurements 
this guidance amends previous guidance on fair value measurements to add new requirements for disclosures about transfers into and out of levels and and separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements relating to level measurement on a gross basis rather than on a net basis as currently required 
this guidance also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
this guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december   except for the requirement to provide the level activities of purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis  which will be effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december  early application is permitted and  in the period of initial adoption  entities are not required to provide the amended disclosures for any previous periods presented for comparative purposes 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in march  fasb issued authoritative guidance regarding the effect of denominating the exercise price of a share based payment awards in the currency of the market in which the underlying equity securities trades and that currency is different from entity s functional currency  functional currency of the foreign operation for which the employee provides services  and payroll currency of the employee 
the guidance clarifies that an employee share based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entity s equity securities trades should be considered an equity award assuming all other criteria for equity classification are met 
the guidance will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after december   and will be applied prospectively 
affected entities will be required to record a cumulative catch up adjustment for all awards outstanding as of the beginning of the annual period in which the guidance is adopted 
this adoption of the authoritative guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  fasb issued an authoritative pronouncement on when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
the amendments in this update modify step so that for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
the qualitative factors are consistent with existing guidance  which requires that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
for public entities  the guidance is effective for impairment tests performed during entities fiscal years and interim periods within those years that begin after december  early adoption will not be permitted 
for nonpublic entities  the guidance is effective for impairment tests performed during entities fiscal years and interim periods within those years that begin after december  early application for nonpublic entities is permitted  nonpublic entities that elect early application will use the same effective date as that for public entities 
this adoption of the authoritative guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued an authoritative pronouncement on disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
the objective of this guidance is to address diversity in practice regarding the interpretation of the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations 
the amendments in this update specify that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
the amendments will be effective for business combinations consummated in periods beginning after december   and should be applied prospectively as of the date of adoption 
early adoption is permitted 
this adoption of the authoritative guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we invest in fixed and variable income investments classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
our cash and cash equivalents are placed primarily in demand deposits  with maturities of three months or less and short term investments are mutual funds 
our borrowings bear fixed interest rates 
as of december   we had short term loans of approximately million and long term loans of approximately million from prc banks  and the weighted average interest rates on our outstanding short term bank loans and long term loans was and  respectively 
in addition  if we were to draw on our line of credit  interest would be a base rate established by the people s bank of china on the unpaid principal amount 
changes in interest rates would impact the interest income derived from our investments  which was million  million and million for the years ended december   and we have not used derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure 
foreign currency risk we conduct substantially all of our operations in the prc  and the renminbi is the national currency in which our operations are conducted 
we have not utilized any derivative financial instruments or any other financial instruments  nor do we utilize any derivative commodity instruments in our operations  nor any similar market sensitive instruments 
the exchange rate between the renminbi and the us dollar is subject to the prc government s foreign currency conversion policies  which may change at any time 
the exchange rate at december  was approximately renminbi to us dollar 
the exchange rate at december  was approximately renminbi to us dollar 
the exchange rate is currently permitted to float within a very limited range 
however  there remains significant international pressure on the prc government to adopt a substantial liberalization of its currency policy  which could result in a further and more significant appreciation in the value of the renminbi against the us dollar 
any devaluation of the renminbi against the us dollar would consequently have an adverse effect on our financial performance and asset values when measured in terms of us dollars 
we recognized a foreign currency translation gain of approximately million for the year ended december  inflation in recent years  china has not experienced significant inflation  and thus inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations 
according to the national bureau of statistics of china  the change in consumer price index in china was  and in  and  respectively
