this discussion and analysis of the financial statements and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements  including the related notes thereto  contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition and accounting for goodwill 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the accounting policies below as the policies critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue using the residual method 
under the residual method  revenue is recognized in a multiple element arrangement when company specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement 
at the outset of the arrangement with the customer  we defer revenue for the fair value of our undelivered elements eg  maintenance based on company specific objective evidence of the 
table of contents amount at which such items are sold individually to our customers and recognize revenue for the remainder of the arrangement fee attributable to the elements initially delivered in the arrangement eg  software license when the basic criteria of revenue recognition has been met 
revenue attributable to an element in a customer arrangement is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and delivery has occurred  provided the fee is fixed or determinable  collectability is probable and the arrangement does not require significant customization of the software 
if  at the outset of the customer arrangement  we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  we defer the revenue and recognize the revenue when the arrangement fee becomes due and payable 
service revenue relates primarily to consulting services  maintenance and training 
maintenance revenue is initially deferred and then recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract  typically months 
consulting and training revenue is recognized as the services are performed and is usually calculated on a time and materials basis 
such services primarily consist of implementation services related to the installation of our products and do not include significant customization to or development of the underlying software code 
we do not have price protection programs  conditional acceptance agreements  and sales of our products are made without right of return 
for contracts that require significant modification or customization to the software in accordance with customers specifications  we recognize revenue using the completed contract method 
under this method  revenue and expenses are deferred until customer acceptance of the finished product occurs 
there was no revenue recognized using the completed contract method for fiscal years  or goodwill 
we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
factors we consider to be important that would trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  timing of our revenue  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization falling below our net book value for a sustained period 
we do not amortize goodwill  but test for goodwill impairment following a two step process 
the first step is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value or carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
currently  we have one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit including unrecognized intangible assets under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge 
estimates of enterprise fair value are currently based on our stock price as reported by nasdaq given our single 
table of contents reporting unit structure 
no impairment of goodwill has been identified during any of the periods presented as the enterprise fair value significantly exceeded carrying value 
due to the current adverse global economic conditions  we continue to monitor the fair value of our reporting unit to identify any potential goodwill impairment 
employee stock based compensation 
share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
we estimate the fair value of stock based awards using a black scholes valuation model 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating volatility  expected terms  and forfeitures 
volatility is estimated based on historical experience 
expected terms are based on historical experience and consideration of the awards contractual terms  vesting schedule and future expectations 
forfeitures are based on our actual forfeiture rate as well as management judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements under the subheading stock based compensation 
income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of the assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
due to uncertainties surrounding the timing of realizing the benefits of the net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits in the future  we carry a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets in domestic and foreign jurisdictions  except france 
we accrue for uncertain tax positions when income tax positions meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of the applicable tax rules and in subsequent periods 
developments such as case law  changes in tax law  new rulings or regulations issued by taxing authorities  and interactions with the taxing authorities could affect whether a position should be recognized or the amount that should be reported 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data in total dollars  as a percentage of total net revenues and as a percentage change from the same period in the prior year 
cost of license revenues and cost of service revenues are expressed as a percentage of the related revenues 
this information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k

our revenue is derived principally from two sources fees from software licensing and fees for post contract technical support 
we generally license our database and rapid application development software primarily on a per cpu  per server  per port or per user basis 
therefore  the addition of cpu s  servers  ports or users of existing systems increases our revenue from our installed base of licenses 
similarly  the reduction of cpu s  servers  ports or users of existing systems decreases our revenue from our installed base of licenses 
the timing of orders and customer ordering patterns has resulted in fluctuations in license revenue between quarters and year to year 
total revenue decreased million or and decreased million or for fiscal year and  respectively  when compared with the same periods in prior years 
the revenue decreases in fiscal year was primarily due to non renewal of support services from our existing customer base as a result of the continued challenging economic conditions and customers moving to other platforms 
the revenue decrease in fiscal year was primarily due to lower orders of licenses and non renewal of support services from our existing customer base as a result of the adverse global economic conditions and customers moving to other platforms 
we anticipate that revenue will continue to be adversely affected as our existing customer base  from which we derive the majority of our revenue  continues to face challenging economic conditions 
we have been actively developing and marketing our newer product lines  including yolink and postano 
should our development efforts and the adoption of these product lines be successful  we anticipate additional revenues in future periods related to these products 
however  we can give no assurances as to customer acceptance of any new products or services  or the ability of the current or any new products and services to 
table of contents generate revenue 
while we are committed to research and development efforts that are intended to allow us to penetrate new markets and generate new sources of revenue  such efforts may not result in additional products  services or revenue 
operating expenses cost of license revenue 
cost of license revenue is comprised of direct costs associated with software license sales including software packaging  documentation  physical media costs and royalties 
cost of license revenue for fiscal year increased when compared with fiscal year primarily due to increase in royalties relating to our new tigerlogic dashboard product released in august cost of license revenue for fiscal year decreased when compared with fiscal year was due to decreased royalties for our main mdms products 
cost of service revenue 
cost of service revenue includes primarily personnel costs relating to providing consulting  technical support and training services 
cost of service revenue remained consistent in fiscal year when compared with fiscal year the slight increase in cost of service revenue for fiscal year  when compared to fiscal year  was due to increased headcount 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries  benefits  advertising  tradeshows  travel and overhead costs for our sales and marketing personnel 
selling and marketing expense for fiscal year increased approximately million or when compared to the same period in the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to higher salary expense of million from headcount additions  higher consulting expense of million for yolink and postano product lines  and higher stock based compensation expense of million due to new stock options granted during the year 
this increase was partially offset by lower marketing design expense of million 
selling and marketing expense for fiscal year decreased approximately million or when compared to the same period in the prior year 
the decrease in fiscal year was mainly due to lower salary expense of million from headcount reductions  lower stock based compensation expense of million  and lower marketing expense of million 
we anticipate that selling and marketing costs related to the yolink and postano product lines may increase as we further develop the sales channel for these products and if customer acceptance of these products increases 
in addition  if our continued research and development efforts are successful  including with respect to our yolink and postano product lines  and new products or services are created  we may incur increased sales and marketing expense to promote those new products in future periods 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses and overhead costs for engineering personnel including employees in the us and the uk and contractors in the us 
research and development expense decreased approximately million or and decreased approximately million or for fiscal years and  respectively  when compared to the same periods in the prior years 
decrease in fiscal year was mainly due to lower facility expense 
decrease in fiscal year was mainly due to lower salary expense of million as a result of lower headcount  lower facility expense of million  lower stock based compensation expense of million  and lower consulting expense of million 
we are committed to our research and development efforts and expect research and development expenses to increase in future periods as we investigate further applications and delivery options for the yolink technology and postano social media tools  and as we build new technology platforms for our rad product line 
such efforts may not result in additional new products and any new products  including our recently launched postano product line  may not generate sufficient revenue  if any  to offset the research and development expense 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of costs associated with our finance  human resources  legal and other administrative functions 
these costs consist principally of salaries and other personnel related expenses  professional fees  depreciation and overhead costs 
general and administrative expense for fiscal year was consistent when compared to the same period in 
table of contents prior year 
general and administrative expense for fiscal year decreased approximately million or when compared to the same period in prior year mainly due to lower legal expense of million as certain pending litigation matters have concluded in the fiscal year  lower consulting expense of million  and lower personnel severance expense of million 
other income expense 
other income expense consists primarily of gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 
until december  we have been recording the intercompany transaction gains and losses in accordance with applicable accounting guidance in determining net income for the period in which exchange rates change 
intercompany transactions and balances for which settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future are considered to be part of the net investment in the foreign subsidiaries and the related adjustments are to be accumulated in a separate component of equity as part of other comprehensive loss 
beginning in december  the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on intercompany balance outstanding as of december   denominated in british pounds  are accumulated in a separate component of equity as part of other comprehensive loss based on our determination that the settlement of this intercompany balance is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future and is therefore considered long term in nature 
due to this change and the fluctuation in british pound exchange rates  other income expense for the fiscal year decreased to approximately  expense when compared to the same period in the prior year 
other income expense for fiscal year increased to million income from million expense in fiscal year mainly due to foreign exchange gains from a significant intercompany balance outstanding denominated in british pound 
due to the uncertainty in exchange rates  we may experience transaction gains or losses in future periods  the effect of which cannot be predicted at this time 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax benefit expense rate was   and for fiscal years   and  respectively 
our effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to the distribution and mixture of taxable profits in various jurisdictions carrying foreign income taxes and certain us losses not recognized due to our valuation allowance 
the increase in income tax provision for fiscal year when compared to fiscal year is due to higher earnings from our foreign subsidiaries  a  provision to return true up for our french subsidiary  and an increase in our uncertain tax position of  related to our german subsidiary 
the decrease in income tax benefit for fiscal year when compared to fiscal year is primarily due to a decrease in the amount of federal refundable research and development tax credits to be claimed by us year over year 
realization of deferred tax assets depends upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  we have offset our net deferred tax assets which are not more likely than not to be realized with a valuation allowance 
the utilization of our net operating losses could be subject to substantial annual limitation as a result of certain future events  such as acquisition or other significant equity events  which may be deemed as a change in ownership under the provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitations could result in the expiration of net operating losses and tax credits before utilization 
on february   the state of california passed a new law to allow taxpayers to make an election to adopt a single sales factor apportionment formula starting with the taxable year 
as of march   we have not considered changing our sales factor apportionment in california 
should we decide to make an election in fiscal year to use a single sales factor  we will need to adjust the blended state rate used to calculate the tax effect of our deferred tax assets liabilities  and record any impact to the financial statements in the period such decision is made 
we believe that any related change to the blended state rate will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had million in cash 
we believe that our existing cash balances will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital expenditure requirements for the remainder of the fiscal year ending march  and through the foreseeable future 
we are committed to research and development and 
table of contents marketing efforts that are intended to allow us to penetrate new markets and generate new sources of revenue and improve operating results 
however  our research and development and marketing efforts have required  and will continue to require  cash outlays without the immediate or short term receipt of related revenue 
our ability to meet our expenditure requirements is dependent upon our future financial performance  and this will be affected by  among other things  prevailing economic conditions  our ability to penetrate new markets and attract new customers  market acceptance of our new and existing products and services  the success of research and development efforts and other factors beyond our control 
on december   we entered into an amendment to our lease agreement dated november  with the irvine company relating to the office space in irvine  california 
the amendment modified certain terms of the original lease as follows a the lease term was extended to october   b the lease completely terminated as to the approximately  square foot portion of the premises from the original  square feet space  and c commencing on march   the total base rent over the new lease amendment term was approximately million 
the annual base rent ranges from approximately  during the first year to approximately  during the last year of the lease 
the rent expense is being recognized on a straight line basis over the new lease term 
effective may   we entered into a three year term lease for approximately  square feet of office space located in mountain view  california 
total base rent over the three year term is approximately  effective april   we entered into a month term lease for approximately  square feet of office space located in portland  oregon 
total based rent over the month term is approximately we had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of march  net cash used by operating activities was million  million  and million for fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
the slight decrease in net cash used by operating activities during fiscal year when compared to the same period in prior year was primarily due to higher collection of account receivable balance  partially offset by lower revenue and higher selling and marketing expense 
the slight decrease in net cash used by operating activities during fiscal year when compared to the same period in prior year was primarily due to improvements in operating expenses  partially offset by lower revenue 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
higher cash used in investing activities in fiscal year was due to higher expenditures related to equipment purchased for development and launch of the yolink search technology 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to proceeds derived from the exercise of stock options  mainly by our former chief executive officer during fiscal year  and corresponding issuance of common stock 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet liabilities or transactions as of march  contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligation as of march   and the effect such obligation is expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating leases

ebitda and adjusted ebitda exclude components that are significant in understanding and assessing our results of operations and cash flows 
ebitda or adjusted ebitda does not represent funds available for management s discretionary use and is not intended to represent cash flow from operations 
in addition  ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not terms defined by gaap and as a result our measure of ebitda and adjusted ebitda might not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
however  ebitda and adjusted ebitda are used by management to evaluate  assess and benchmark our operational results and we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda are relevant and useful information widely used by analysts  investors and other interested parties in our industry 
accordingly  we are disclosing this information to permit a more comprehensive analysis of our operating performance  to provide an additional measure of performance and liquidity and to provide additional information with respect to our ability to meet future capital expenditure and working capital requirements 
ebitda is defined as net income loss with adjustments for depreciation and amortization  interest income expense net  and income tax provision benefit

our adjusted ebitda were negative million or negative  negative million or negative  and negative million or negative of total net revenue  for the years ended march   and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal year adjusted ebitda as compared to fiscal year was mainly due to lower revenue for support services and higher selling and marketing expense for our newer yolink and postano product lines 
the improvement in fiscal adjusted ebitda as compared to fiscal was a result of lower operating expenses
