item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided to enhance the understanding of  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
business overview we provide business process outsourcing services to government health and human services agencies under our mission of helping government serve the people 
our business is focused almost exclusively on administering government sponsored programs such as medicaid  chip  health care reform  welfare to work  medicare  child support enforcement and other government programs 
founded in  we are one of the largest pure play health and human services administrative providers to governments in the united states  australia  canada and the united kingdom 
we use our expertise  experience and advanced technological solutions to help government agencies run efficient  cost effective programs and to improve program accountability  while enhancing the quality of services provided to program beneficiaries 
during recent years  the company has focused on its core health and human services  expanding these operations in the united states and internationally  while disposing of non core businesses 
this approach has resulted in the company earning an increasing share of its revenues from overseas markets  up from in to in we believe that this focus  balanced by a risk management structure  has enabled the company to attain profitable growth in recent years 
the company believes that a combination of its record of results  robust financial performance and global experience leaves it well positioned to capitalize on opportunities in its existing markets and elsewhere 
industry considerations within the united states  the current economic environment facing state and local governments is extremely challenging 
not only are they experiencing fiscal challenges  but they are also facing increasing demand for critical services from the most vulnerable members of society 
at the same time  states are generally required to balance their budgets each year 
since medicaid accounts for a large portion of states budgets  many states have taken steps to control costs by increasing co pays  reducing provider rates  modifying benefits and shifting more populations into medicaid managed care 
as more populations shift into managed care  demand for our administrative services and program volumes generally increase 
the situation for international governments is also challenging  with each of the areas in which maximus operates offering unique local issues in addition to general global economic factors 
both australia and the united kingdom have implemented austerity measures to deal with significant debt and commitments 

table of contents results of operations consolidated the following table sets forth  for the fiscal year ends indicated  selected statements of operations data year ended september  dollars in thousands  except per share data revenue gross profit selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue operating income excluding legal and settlement expense operating income excluding legal and settlement expense as a percentage of revenue legal and settlement recovery  net operating income from continuing operations operating margin from continuing operations interest and other income  net income from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes tax rate income loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes loss on disposal net income basic earnings per share income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations basic earnings per share diluted earnings per share income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations diluted earnings per share the following provides an overview of the significant elements of our consolidated statements of operations 
as each of our business segments have different factors driving revenue growth and profitability  the sections that follow cover these segments in greater detail 
we discuss constant currency revenue information to provide a framework for assessing how our business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations 
to provide this information  revenue from foreign operations is converted into united states dollars using average exchange rates from the previous fiscal year 
we discuss operating income from continuing operations excluding legal and settlement recoveries 
legal and settlement recoveries are typically driven by factors that are not consistent with other drivers of our business  and the timing and extent of both legal and settlement expenses and recoveries may have an unusual effect on our financial results 
in the three years ended september   we have consistently recorded recoveries from insurance settlements and we believe that excluding these recoveries from operating expense provides a framework for assessing how the business performed excluding the effects of legal and settlement recoveries 
constant currency revenue and operating income excluding legal and settlement recoveries are non gaap numbers 
we believe that these numbers provide a useful basis for assessing the company s performance 
the presentation of these non gaap numbers is not meant to be considered in isolation  or as an alternative to revenue growth or operating income as measures of performance 
in fiscal  the company acquired deltaware systems  inc deltaware 
this acquisition was not material to revenue or operating income and substantially all growth in the two years ended september  has been organic 

table of contents revenue increased to million for the year ended september   compared with the prior year 
on a constant currency basis  growth would have been 
both the company s health services and human services segments contributed to this growth  with approximately half of the growth in each segment 
revenue increased to million for the year ended september   compared with the prior year 
on a constant currency basis  the revenue growth would have been 
the principal driver of growth was the human services segment 
see information on the individual segments below for discussion of drivers 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a consists of costs related to general management  marketing and administration 
these costs include salaries  benefits  bid and proposal efforts  travel  recruiting  continuing education  employee training  non chargeable labor costs  facilities costs  printing  reproduction  communications  equipment depreciation  intangible amortization and legal expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business 
sg a as a percentage of revenue has been relatively consistent for each of the last three years 
the company believes some sg a benefit is derived from economies of scale and that operating profit is a more meaningful metric for the business 
operating income from continuing operations increased to million for the year ended september   compared to the prior year 
excluding the legal and settlement recoveries  growth would have been 
this growth was caused by growth in the business  increasing economies of scale and the benefits of favorable exchange rate fluctuations 
operating income from continuing operations increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  from million to million 
the increase of million was been driven by growth in the business  the benefits of favorable exchange rates on foreign sourced income  and increasing economies of scale in operating the business 
during fiscal years  and  the company received net recoveries of legal and settlement expense of million  million  and million  respectively 
net legal and settlement recoveries consist of costs  net of reimbursed insurance claims  related to significant legal settlements and non routine legal matters  including future probable legal costs estimated to be incurred in connection with those matters 
the incremental costs of acquisitions  including legal fees  brokerage fees  and valuation reports  are also included in this balance 
legal expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business are included in selling  general and administrative expense 
during the year  the company reversed a legal expense previously recognized in fiscal for a matter which concluded without liability to the company 
in the two years ended september  and  the company received insurance recoveries of million and million which related to a legal settlement entered into by the company during fiscal year the following table sets forth the matters that represent legal and settlement recovery  net dollars in thousands year ended september  insurance recoveries other total the increase in interest and other income between and is primarily attributable to increases in cash balance in jurisdictions which have high interest rates 
at september   of the company s cash is held in jurisdictions other than the united states  compared with at september  the increase has been driven by strong cash flows in international businesses 
provisions for income taxes from continuing operations were   and in  and  respectively 
the principal reason for the decline in the tax rate reflects the increasing amount of profit being recorded in foreign jurisdictions where income tax rates are lower than those within the united states 

table of contents health services segment year ended september  dollars in thousands revenue gross profit operating income operating margin percentage the health services segment provides a variety of business process outsourcing and administrative support services  as well as consulting services for state  provincial and federal programs  such as medicaid  chip  medicare and the british columbia health insurance program 
in fiscal  revenue increased compared to fiscal the principal driver of this growth was the expansion of existing work  with contracts in texas and british columbia contributing over of the increase 
in texas  the company benefitted from increases in transaction based activities as more medicaid populations are shifted into managed care plans 
in british columbia  additional work is being driven by the modernization of a system linking all pharmacies across the province 
further growth in revenue was generated by higher volumes in transaction based work in the company s federal appeals practice 
operating margin has improved from to 
this improvement was driven principally by the volume growth in the federal practice and the add on work in british columbia 
in fiscal  revenue increased compared to fiscal driven by the acquisition of deltaware in  which accounted for of this growth  with the rest of the growth attributable to new work 
operating margin in was lower compared to fiscal  principally due to the timing on contract rebids and the expansion of lower risk  cost reimbursable programs  where margins are typically lower 
human services segment year ended september  dollars in thousands revenue gross profit operating income operating margin percentage the human services segment includes a variety of business process outsourcing  case management  job training and support services for programs such as welfare to work programs  child support enforcement  k special education and other specialized consulting services 
revenue increased to million in fiscal year compared to fiscal on a constant currency basis  the growth would have been 
growth in the human services segment was principally driven by our welfare to work businesses  particularly in australia and the united kingdom 
the australian business provided much of this growth driven by strong volumes and performance 
within the united kingdom  we accelerated the recognition of deferred revenue as a result of the earlier end date of the flexible new deal which was offset by cost increases related to the start up of the work programme contract 
operating margins improved compared to the prior year  principally due to increased contract performance in australia and profit improvement on the flexible new deal contract in the united kingdom 
the company also incurred million of charges related to a fixed price education contract in the united states  compared to a similar charge of million in fiscal no further charges have been incurred by this project since the second quarter of fiscal and the contract is anticipated to be completed during the fiscal year 
revenue increased to million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily driven by program expansion in australia which commenced in the fourth quarter of fiscal and new work in the united kingdom which commenced in the first quarter fiscal 
operating margin improvement in fiscal compared to fiscal was driven by margin improvement attributed to revenue growth in australia and the united kingdom  with the results tempered by cost growth on the fixed price education contract noted above 

table of contents discontinued operations on september   the company sold its erp division for cash proceeds of million  net of transaction costs of million  and recognized a pre tax loss on sale of less than million 
the company previously recorded a pre tax loss on sale of million in fiscal in  the company resolved a dispute with the buyer regarding the purchase price adjustment clause in their contract and recorded a loss of million 
the following table summarizes the operating results of the discontinued operations included in the consolidated statements of operations in thousands year ended september  revenue income loss from operations before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes income loss from discontinued operations loss on disposal before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes loss on disposal income loss from discontinued operations liquidity and capital resources in recent years  the company has relied upon cash flows from operations to fund operations  capital expenditures  acquisitions  share repurchases and dividends 
both domestic and overseas locations have remained self sufficient in funding operations and capital resources 
the company expects to be able to continue to fund operations and capital expenditures from operating cash flows 
in prior periods  the company has faced short term payment delays from state customers  all of which were ultimately recovered 
the company believes its liquidity and capital positions are adequate to weather short term payment delays 
in the event of more protracted delays  the company may be required to seek additional capital sources  amend payment terms or take other actions 
extended payment delays could adversely affect the company s cash flows  operations and profitability 
at september   the company held million in cash and cash equivalents 
approximately of these funds are held in overseas locations and  accordingly  there may be adverse tax consequences on its use in the united states 
in addition to these cash balances  the company had access to an additional million from a credit facility in the united states 
these funds are available to cover short term cash requirements and other potential capital outlays  including share repurchases and acquisitions 
the company has also utilized a million interest free loan from the atlantic innovation fund of canada 
these funds must be used for certain investment projects within prince edward island 
our primary source of cash is revenues received from customers 
our collection of cash is driven by billing schedules and payment terms which can vary based upon a number of factors  including contract type 
in certain contracts  particularly international welfare to work contracts  cash receipts are structured around our performance  which may take several quarters to be realized 
in these cases  contracts will typically result in cash outflows over the early period of the contract and the ultimate cash flows of the contract will be subject to risk until the performance outcomes are known 
certain contracts require significant financial outlay in terms of capital assets and in reimbursable start up costs 
these expenditures result in our use of cash which may be reimbursed during the set up phase or over the life of the contract 
related revenue may also be deferred during the set up phase 
at september   management considered that the net book value of all capital assets  including deferred contract costs  was less than the expected future cash flows related to these assets 

table of contents the following table provides a summary of our cash flow information for the years ended september    and year ended september  dollars in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities continuing operations operating activities discontinued operations investing activities continuing operations investing activities discontinued operations financing activities continuing operations effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was million in fiscal  a decline of million compared to fiscal the principal driver for this decline was the cash flows associated with the united kingdom s flexible new deal program  which provided significant up front funds during fiscal  resulting in a larger deferred revenue balance 
in the united kingdom  we received million of cash in excess of revenues in fiscal and recognized revenues in excess of cash receipts of million in fiscal  a net change in deferred revenue of million 
the united kingdom contract was the largest driver of changes in deferred revenue 
fiscal cash flows were also adversely affected by the timing of tax payments  with payments in excess of expense of million  resulting in prepaid income taxes 
these declines were offset by an increase in net income of million 
cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was million in fiscal  an increase of million compared to fiscal principal drivers for this increase were an increase in net income of million  favorable payment terms on certain contracts  principally the united kingdom flexible new deal  resulting in significant deferred revenue of million  timing on cash collections of receivables of million  and a non recurring payment of million made in conjunction with the legal settlement with tx hhsc and accenture in december  offset by million of insurance recoveries 
the legal settlement was recorded as an expense in fiscal but not paid until fiscal cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations relates to the company s erp division  which was disposed of at september  payments made in fiscal principally relate to the settlement of payroll and other liabilities that remained with the company at the date of disposal 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the decline of million is principally caused by a million decline in payments to acquire businesses  notably deltaware 
in fiscal  the company paid million for deltaware and other businesses  in fiscal  a single payment of million was made to the previous owners of deltaware related to the achievement of an earn out 
the balance of the difference was caused by million additional capital expenditure in the fiscal year principally in the united states and british columbia  and a million receipt from the sale of the erp business in fiscal cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was million in fiscal  compared with million in the increase of million was principally driven by million of acquisition payments related to deltaware and other acquisitions in  compared with million in  offset by declines in overall capital spending of approximately million following significant build out for contract expansions in australia and the united kingdom  as well as the completion of an enterprise resource planning system for internal use in  and million of cash received from the sale of the company s erp division in  compared with cash payments of million related to other disposals in 
table of contents cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was million  million  and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
these cash flows were principally driven by repurchases of common stock of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company also paid million  million and million in dividends in  and  respectively  with the increases driven by changes in the dividend per share amount 
the most recent fiscal year also benefitted from significant exercises of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock units at fair values in excess of their grant date values  which results in a tax benefit 
the increases in the fiscal year were driven by increases in our share price and the imminent expiry of many of our stock awards 
the detrimental effect of exchange rates of cash and cash equivalents of million in the fiscal year reflects the strengthening of the united states dollar and increases in our overseas cash balances  notably in australia 
to supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a gaap basis  we use the non gaap measure of free cash flows from continuing operations to analyze the funds generated from operations 
we believe free cash flow from continuing operations is a useful basis for comparing our performance with our competitors 
the presentation of non gaap free cash flows from continuing operations is not meant to be considered in isolation  or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of performance  or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
we calculate free cash flow from continuing operations as follows year ended september  dollars in thousands cash provided by operating activities continuing operations purchases of property and equipment capitalized software costs free cash flow from continuing operations repurchases of the company s common stock under resolutions adopted in july and september  the board of directors has authorized the repurchase  at management s discretion  of up to an aggregate of million of the company s common stock 
the resolutions also authorize the use of option exercise proceeds for the repurchase of the company s common stock 
during the years ended september   and  the company has repurchased   and  common shares at a cost of million  million and million  respectively 
as of november   the company had repurchased an additional  shares at a cost of million during the first quarter of fiscal on november   the board of directors replaced the existing share repurchase program with a new program  which authorizes the company to purchase  at management s discretion  up to million of its common stock 
letters of credit and performance bonds certain contracts require us to provide a letter of credit or a surety bond as a guarantee of performance 
at september   the company had letters of credit totaling million and performance bond commitments totaling million 
these letters of credit and performance bonds are typically renewed annually and remain in place until the contractual obligations have been satisfied 
although the triggering events vary from contract to contract  in general  we would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in our performance of our obligations under each contract  the probability of which we believe is remote 
dividend on october   the company s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of for each share of the company s common stock outstanding 
the dividend will be paid on november  to shareholders of record on november  based on the number of shares outstanding  the payment will be approximately million 

table of contents obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at september  that require the company to make future cash payments in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years dollars in thousands operating leases long term debt acquisition related contingent consideration deferred compensation plan liabilities total acquisition related contingent liabilities are based upon the achievement of profitability and sales targets 
the fair value was determined based on a probability weighted approach derived from management s estimates 
the timing and amount of these contingent payments are based upon our current assessment of the fair value of the liability 
see note fair value measurements 
deferred compensation plan liabilities are typically payable at times elected by the employee at the time of deferral 
however  early withdrawal is permitted for certain conditions  including employee hardship or termination  which may accelerate the payment of these liabilities 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with the company s unrecognized income tax benefits at september   we are unable to reasonably estimate settlements with taxing authorities 
the above contractual obligations table does not reflect unrecognized income tax benefits of approximately million  of which approximately million is related interest and penalties 
see note income taxes of the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on income taxes 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have material off balance sheet risk or exposure to liabilities that are not recorded or disclosed in our financial statements 
while we have significant operating lease commitments for office space  those commitments are generally tied to the period of performance under related contracts 
additionally  although on certain contracts we are bound by performance bond commitments and standby letters of credit  we have not had any defaults resulting in draws on performance bonds 
also  we do not speculate in derivative transactions 

table of contents effects of inflation as measured by revenue  approximately of our business is conducted under cost reimbursable contracts which adjust revenue to cover costs increased by inflation 
approximately of the business is time and material contracts where labor rates are often fixed for several years 
we generally have been able to price these contracts in a manner that accommodates the rates of inflation experienced in recent years 
the remaining portions of our contracts are fixed price and performance based and are typically priced to account for the likely inflation from period to period to mitigate the risk of our business being adversely affected by inflation 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition and cost estimation on certain contracts  the realizability of goodwill  and amounts related to income taxes  certain accrued liabilities and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition 
revenue is generated from contracts with various pricing arrangements  including fixed price  performance based criteria  costs incurred plus a negotiated fee cost plus  and time and materials 
also  some contracts contain not to exceed provisions 
of the contracts with not to exceed provisions  to the extent we estimate we will exceed the contractual limits  we treat these contracts as fixed price 
for fiscal  revenue from performance based contracts was approximately of total revenue  revenue from cost plus contracts was approximately of total revenue  revenue from fixed price contracts was approximately of total revenue  and revenue from time and materials contracts was approximately of total revenue 
a majority of the contracts with state and local government agencies have been fixed price and performance based  and our contracts with the federal government generally have been cost plus 
fixed price and performance based contracts generally offer higher margins but typically involve more risk than cost plus or time and materials reimbursement contracts 
we recognize revenue on general service arrangements as work is performed and amounts are earned 
we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  services are delivered  fees are fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue on performance based contracts when earned  which generally occurs when amounts are billable to customers 
for certain contracts  this may result in revenue being recognized in irregular increments 
revenue on cost plus contracts is recognized based on costs incurred plus an estimate of the negotiated fee earned 
revenue on time and materials contracts is recognized based on hours worked and expenses incurred 
we recognize revenue on fixed price contracts when earned  as services are provided 
for certain fixed price contracts  primarily systems design  development and implementation  we recognize revenue based on costs incurred using estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs to be incurred 
the cumulative impact of any revisions in estimated revenue and costs is recognized in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
provisions for estimated losses on incomplete contracts are provided for in full in the period in which such losses become known 
this policy may result in revenues being recognized at different points from amounts being billable 
for other fixed price contracts  revenue is recognized on a straight line basis unless evidence suggests that revenue is earned or obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
with fixed price contracts  we are subject to the risk of potential cost overruns 
costs related to contracts may be incurred in periods prior to recognizing revenue 
these costs are generally expensed 
however  certain direct and incremental set up costs may be deferred until services are provided and revenue begins to be recognized  when such costs are recoverable from a contractual arrangement 
set up costs are costs related to activities that enable us to provide contractual services to a client 
the timing of expense recognition may result in irregular profit margins 

table of contents where contracts have multiple deliverables  we evaluate these deliverables at the inception of each contract and as each item is delivered 
as part of this evaluation  we consider whether a delivered item has value to a customer on a stand alone basis and whether the delivery of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control  if a general right of return exists 
where deliverables  or groups of deliverables  have both of these characteristics  we treat each deliverable item as a separate unit of accounting  allocate a fair value to each deliverable and apply the relevant revenue recognition guidance to each deliverable 
for transactions entered into prior to october   the ability to isolate deliverables as separate units of accounting also required objective and reliable evidence of the fair market value of the undelivered items 
this change in accounting rules did not have a material effect on the company s business 
impairment of goodwill 
goodwill is typically obtained by the company as a result of business combinations 
goodwill represents the difference between the consideration paid in acquiring the business and the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing on an annual basis  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level 
performing the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including how we define reporting units and determine their fair value 
a reporting unit is the operating segment  or a business one level below that operating segment the component level if discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed regularly by segment management 
however  components are aggregated if they have similar economic characteristics 
we recognize an impairment charge for any amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its fair value 
we use discounted cash flows to establish fair values 
when available and as appropriate  we use comparative market multiples to corroborate the discounted cash flow results 
when a portion of a reporting unit is disposed of  goodwill is allocated using the relative fair value method for purposes of calculating the gain or loss on disposal 
in addition  a goodwill impairment test is performed for the remaining portion of the reporting unit 
the company performs its annual impairment test as of july of each year 
at july   the company performed the annual impairment test and determined that there had been no impairment of goodwill 
changes in estimates and assumptions we make in conducting our goodwill impairment assessment could affect the estimated future fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment in the future 
however  a decline in the estimated fair value of any of our reporting units at july  would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment charge 
long lived assets excluding goodwill in addition to goodwill  the company s assets include property and equipment  internal use capitalized software  intangible assets related to acquisitions and deferred contract costs  being the contractually recoverable costs related to direct set up costs at the establishment of a contract 
these assets are expensed over the period which we believe to represent their useful economic life 
we review these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
our review would typically be based upon the projection of undiscounted future operating cash flows related to the particular asset or asset group 
to the extent that such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to cover the carrying amount  we recognize a non cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount to equal future discounted cash flows 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to cover the risk of collecting less than full payment on our receivables 
on a regular basis we re evaluate our client receivables  especially receivables that are past due  and reassess our allowance for doubtful accounts based on specific client collection issues 
if our clients were to express dissatisfaction with the services we have provided  additional allowances may be required 
contingencies 
from time to time  we are involved in legal proceedings  including contract and employment claims  in the ordinary course of business 
we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these contingencies as well as potential ranges of probable losses and establish reserves accordingly 
the amount of reserves required may change in future periods due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach to a matter such as a change in settlement strategy 

table of contents income taxes 
to record income tax expense  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
in addition  income tax expense at interim reporting dates requires us to estimate our expected effective tax rate for the entire year 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences that result in deferred tax assets and liabilities and expected future tax rates 
circumstances that could cause our estimates of income tax expense to change include the impact of information that subsequently becomes available as we prepare our tax returns  revision to tax positions taken as a result of further analysis and consultation  changes in the geographic mix of our business  the actual level of pre tax income  changes in tax rules  regulations and rates  and changes mandated as a result of audits by taxing authorities 
we may also establish tax reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we may not fully succeed 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts  such as the progress of a tax audit  new case law or expiration of a statute of limitations 
the company accounts for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when  based upon the technical merits  it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that our exposure to market risk related to the effect of changes in interest rates  commodity prices and other market risks with regard to instruments entered into for trading or for other purposes is immaterial 
the company is exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations in the australian dollar  the canadian dollar  and the british pound 
during the year ended september   the company earned approximately of revenues and of operating income from foreign subsidiaries 
at september   approximately of the company s assets are held by foreign subsidiaries 
the company mitigates its foreign exchange risks through maintaining sufficient capital within its foreign subsidiaries to support the short term and long term capital requirements of these businesses 
the company s foreign subsidiaries typically incur costs in the same currency as they earn revenues  thus limiting the company s exposure to unexpected expenditures 
the operations of the us business do not depend upon cash flows from foreign subsidiaries
