item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following is a discussion of the company financial condition and results of operation for the years ended december   and this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and the notes to those financial statements 
this discussion contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended and the private securities litigation reform act of  and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provided for under these sections 
these statements may include words such as believe  estimate  project  intend  expect  plan  anticipate  and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events 
forward looking statements reflect management current expectations and observations with respect to future events and financial performance 
where we express an expectation or belief as to future events or results  such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis 
however  our forward looking statements are subject to risks  uncertainties  and other factors  which could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed  projected  or implied by those forward looking statements 
the principal factors that affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows include  charter market rates  which started to decline significantly in from historic highs and partially recover during  and periods of charter hire  vessel operating expenses and voyage costs  which are incurred primarily in us dollars  depreciation expenses  which are a function of the cost of our vessels  significant vessel improvement costs and our vessels estimated useful lives  and financing costs related to our indebtedness 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors which could include the following i changes in demand in the dry bulk market  including  without limitation  changes in production of  or demand for  commodities and bulk cargoes  generally or in particular regions  ii greater than anticipated levels of dry bulk vessel new building orders or lower than anticipated rates of dry bulk vessel scrapping  iii changes in rules and regulations applicable to the dry bulk industry  including  without limitation  legislation adopted by international bodies or organizations such as the international maritime organization and the european union or by individual countries  iv actions taken by regulatory authorities  v changes in trading patterns significantly impacting overall dry bulk tonnage requirements  vi changes in the typical seasonal variations in dry bulk charter rates  vii changes in the cost of other modes of bulk commodity transportation  viii changes in general domestic and international political conditions  ix changes in the condition of the company vessels or applicable maintenance or regulatory standards which may affect  among other things  our anticipated dry docking costs  x and other factors listed from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
this discussion also includes statistical data regarding world dry bulk fleet and orderbook and fleet age 
we generated some of these data internally  and some were obtained from independent industry publications and reports that we believe to be reliable sources 
we have not independently verified these data nor sought the consent of any organizations to refer to their reports in this annual report 
we disclaim any intent or obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise  except as may be required under applicable securities laws 
overview we are eagle bulk shipping inc  a republic of marshall islands corporation headquartered in new york city 
we own one of the largest fleets of supramax dry bulk vessels in the world 
supramax dry bulk vessels range in size from  to  dwt 
we transport a broad range of major and minor bulk cargoes  including iron ore  coal  grain  cement and fertilizer  along worldwide shipping routes 
as of december   we owned and operated a modern fleet of handymax segment dry bulk vessels  of which are of the supramax class 
we also have an on going supramax newbuilding program for the construction of an additional newbuilding vessels in china 
upon delivery of all newbuilding vessels by end  our total fleet will consist of vessels with a combined carrying capacity of approximately million dwt 
we are focused on maintaining a high quality fleet that is concentrated primarily in one vessel type handymax dry bulk carriers and its sub category of supramax vessels  which are handymax vessels ranging in size from  to  dwt 
these vessels have the cargo loading and unloading flexibility of on board cranes while offering cargo carrying capacities approaching that of panamax dry bulk vessels  which range in size from  to  dwt and rely on port facilities to load and offload their cargoes 
we believe that the cargo handling flexibility and cargo carrying capacity of the supramax class vessels make them attractive to cargo interests and vessel charterers 
the vessels in our operating fleet  with an aggregate carrying capacity of  deadweight tons  have an average age of only five years compared to an average age for the world handymax dry bulk fleet of approximately years 
during the third quarter of  the company launched a freight trading operation to capitalize on value creation strategies in spot trading which includes contracts of affreightment  time charter in and out and derivative instruments 
these trading capabilities will extend the company global presence  which includes a new office in singapore 
our financial performance is based on the following key elements of our business strategy concentration in one vessel category supramax class of handymax dry bulk vessels  which we believe offer size  operational and geographical advantages over panamax and capesize vessels  our strategy is to balance between long term time charters and revenues generated by short term time charters and voyage charters to maximize our financial performance throughout shipping cycles 
we have entered into time charter employment contracts for all the vessels in our operating fleet and a substantial portion of our newbuilding fleet we charter some of our vessels pursuant to one to three year time charters to allow us to take advantage of the stable cash flow and high utilization rates that are associated with medium to long term time charters 
several of the newly constructed vessels are on long term charters with an average duration of eight years 
the vessels that are on charters whose revenues are linked to the baltic supramax index generally have durations of one year or less 
these index linked charters and voyage charters provide us with the revenue upside as the market improves 
we believe that this structure provides significant visibility to our future financial results and allows us to take advantage of the stable cash flows and high utilization rates that are associated with medium to long term time charters  while at the same time providing us with the revenue upside potential from the index linked or short term time charters or voyage charters 
all the charters provide for fixed semi monthly payments in advance 
while we remain focused on securing charters with fixed base rates  we have also entered into contracts with fixed minimum rates and profit sharing arrangements  enabling us to benefit from an increasing rate environment while still minimizing downside risk 
we regularly monitor the dry bulk shipping market and based on market conditions we may consider taking advantage of short term charter rates 
maintain high quality vessels and improve standards of operation through improved environmental procedures  crew training and maintenance and repair procedures  and maintain a balance between purchasing vessels as market conditions and opportunities arise and maintaining prudent financial ratios eg leverage ratio 
the following are several significant events that occurred during in january  we took delivery of four newbuilding vessels  thrasher  crane  egret and golden eagle this vessel is the fourth of the series of five vessels being built in japan 
in february  we took delivery of two newbuilding vessels  avocet and imperial eagle the last vessel of the series of five vessels being built in japan 
in april  we took delivery of our ninth newbuilding vessel from china  gannet bulker 
in may  we took delivery of our tenth newbuilding vessel from china  grebe bulker 
in june  we took delivery of our eleventh newbuilding vessel from china  ibis bulker 
in july  we took delivery of our twelfth and thirteenth newbuilding vessel from china  jay and kingfisher 
in august  we took delivery of our fourteenth newbuilding vessel from china  martin 
in september  we launched our freight trading operation 
the trading operation will extend the company global presence  which includes a new office in singapore 
in september  we sold the oldest and smallest vessel in its fleet  the griffon a built handymax and we realized a net gain of  and received net proceeds of  the following are several significant events that occurred during in january  we took delivery of a newbuilding vessel  crested eagle 
this vessel is the second of the series of five vessels being built in japan 
in march  we took delivery of a newbuilding vessel  stellar eagle 
this vessel is the third of the series of five vessels being built in japan 
in may june  we raised million by issuing shares of our common stock 
in august  we amended and reduced our revolving credit facility to in september  we set up our own in house technical management operation 
we took delivery of our third newbuilding vessel from china  bittern  in october we took delivery of our fourth newbuilding vessel from china  canary  in december the following are several significant events that occurred during in may  we acquired two supramax vessels  goldeneye and redwing  which delivered into our fleet in june and september  respectively 
we took delivery of the first of our newbuilding vessels  wren in june this vessel is the first of the series of vessels being built in china under construction contracts 
we took delivery of our second newbuilding vessel from china  woodstar  in october we took delivery of our third newbuilding vessel  crowned eagle  in november this vessel is the first of the series of five vessels being built in japan 
in december  we renegotiated our vessel newbuilding program in china by converting firm construction contracts on eight charter free vessels into options 
the contract deposits on these vessels were redirected as progress payments towards vessels being constructed for delivery in we also deferred delivery of a vessel  thrush  from september to november these changes in the newbuilding program resulted in a reduction of the company capital expenditure program by a total of million 
in december  we amended and reduced our revolving credit facility to  we have employed all of our vessels on time and voyage charters

market overview the international shipping industry is highly competitive and fragmented with many market participants 
there are approximately  dry bulk carriers of over  dwt aggregating approximately million dwt  and the ownership of the world dry bulk fleet remains very fragmented with no single owner accounting for more than of any one sector 
we primarily compete with other owners of dry bulk vessels in the handymax and handysize class and panamax class sectors that are mainly privately owned fleets 
competition in virtually all drybulk trades is intense and based primarily on supply and demand 
such demand is a function of world economic conditions and the consequent requirement for commodities  production and consumption patterns  as well as events which interrupt production  trade routes and consumption 
we compete for charters on the basis of price  vessel location  size  age  and condition of the vessel  as well as on our reputation as an owner and operator 
increasingly  major customers are demonstrating a preference for modern vessels based on concerns about the environmental and operational risks associated with older vessels 
consequently  owners of large modern fleets have gained a competitive advantage over owners of older fleets 
our strategy is to concentrate in one vessel category of the dry bulk segment of the shipping industry the handymax sector 
handymax dry bulk vessels range in size from  to  dwt 
within the handymax sector  the industry has migrated to a larger size of vessel class called the supramax class of dry bulk vessels which range in size from  to  dwt 
these vessels have the cargo loading and unloading flexibility of on board cranes while offering cargo carrying capacities approaching that of panamax dry bulk vessels  which range in size from  to  dwt and must rely on port facilities to load and offload their cargoes 
we believe that the cargo handling flexibility and cargo carrying capacity of the supramax class vessels make them attractive to potential charterers 
thirty six of the vessels in our operating fleet as of december  are classified as supramax vessels 
all of the vessels under construction are also supramax class vessels 
the supply of dry bulk vessels depends primarily on the level of the orderbook  the fleet age profile  and the operating efficiency of the existing fleet 
as of january  of the world handymax fleet is years or older 
the handymax vessels in our operating fleet have an average age of approximately years as of december   compared to an average age for the world handymax dry bulk fleet of over years 
the handymax newbuilding orderbook currently stands at of the world handymax fleet 
the handymax market the drybulk market  especially the sub panamax segment  experienced a healthy recovery in with supramax rates posting a increase year on year  outperforming the other asset classes 
this can be attributed to a strong increase of over in demand for both major and minor bulks  thanks to a continued appetite for commodities from both china and india and demand recovery in oecd 
also supporting rates in was lower than expected supply growth especially when compared to panamax and capesize segments attributable to significant slippage and cancellations of newbuilding deliveries approximating 
industry research indicates estimated dry bulk vessel deliveries for and are million dwt and m dwt respectively 
it is widely believed that a material amount of these scheduled newbuildings will not be delivered for a variety of reasons including inflated orderbook figures  owner and yard related financing issues  and increasing labor costs and appreciating currency issues for yards 
demand for drybulk is expected to remain robust in with growth expected to reach approximately  again attributed to continued appetite from china  india  other asia  and demand recovery in oecd 
in the capesize sector  about vessels are on order which is equivalent to of existing fleet 
scheduled deliveries are vessels for  vessels for and vessels for the panamax sector has about of its existing fleet on order with approximately vessels expected to be delivered in both and the handymax sector has about of its existing fleet on order with the bulk of deliveries occurring in and however  sub panamax fleet is older with a considerable proportion of the trading fleet years or older 
and in a low freight rate environment this segment will see the highest scrapping potential which would improve the supply demand equilibrium bringing rates into balance 
lack of historical operating data for vessels before their acquisition consistent with shipping industry practice  other than inspection of the physical condition of the vessels and examinations of classification society records  there is no historical financial due diligence process when we acquire vessels 
accordingly  we do not obtain the historical operating data for the vessels from the sellers because that information is not material to our decision to make acquisitions  nor do we believe it would be helpful to potential investors in our common stock in assessing our business or profitability 
most vessels are sold under a standardized agreement  which  among other things  provides the buyer with the right to inspect the vessel and the vessel classification society records 
the standard agreement does not give the buyer the right to inspect  or receive copies of  the historical operating data of the vessel 
prior to the delivery of a purchased vessel  the seller typically removes from the vessel all records  including past financial records and accounts related to the vessel 
in addition  the technical management agreement between the seller technical manager and the seller is automatically terminated and the vessel trading certificates are revoked by its flag state following a change in ownership 
consistent with shipping industry practice  we treat the acquisition of a vessel whether acquired with or without charter as the acquisition of an asset rather than a business 
although vessels are generally acquired free of charter  we have acquired and may in the future acquire some vessels with time charters 
where a vessel has been under a voyage charter  the vessel is delivered to the buyer free of charter  and it is rare in the shipping industry for the last charterer of the vessel in the hands of the seller to continue as the first charterer of the vessel in the hands of the buyer 
in most cases  when a vessel is under time charter and the buyer wishes to assume that charter  the vessel cannot be acquired without the charterer consent and the buyer entering into a separate direct agreement with the charterer to assume the charter 
the purchase of a vessel itself does not transfer the charter  because it is a separate service agreement between the vessel owner and the charterer 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of those financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
critical accounting policies are those that reflect significant judgments of uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have described below what we believe are our most critical accounting policies  because they generally involve a comparatively higher degree of judgment in their application 
for a description of all our accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included herein 
revenue recognition we currently generate our revenue from time charters and voyage charters 
time charters revenue are for a specific period of time at a specific rate per day  and are generally not as complex or as subjective as voyage charters 
for long term time charters  revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the charter 
revenue related to profit sharing on time charters is not recorded until fixed and determinable 
we recognize voyage charter revenue ratably over the estimated length of each voyage  calculated on discharge to discharge basis 
we do not begin recognizing voyage revenue until a charter has been agreed to by both the company and the customer  even if the vessel has discharged its cargo and is sailing to the anticipated load port on its next voyage 
vessel lives and impairment the carrying value of each of our vessels represents its original cost at the time it was delivered or purchased less depreciation 
we depreciate our dry bulk vessels on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  estimated to be years from date of initial delivery from the shipyard to the original owner 
depreciation is based on cost less the estimated residual salvage value 
salvage  or scrap  value is based upon a vessel lightweight tonnage lwt multiplied by a scrap rate 
we use a scrap rate of per lwt  which we believe is common in the dry bulk shipping industry  to compute each vessel salvage value 
an increase in the useful life of a dry bulk vessel or in its salvage value would have the effect of decreasing the annual depreciation charge and extending it into later periods 
a decrease in the useful life of a dry bulk vessel or in its salvage value would have the effect of increasing the annual depreciation charge 
however  when regulations place limitations over the ability of a vessel to trade on a worldwide basis  the vessel useful life is adjusted to end at the date such regulations become effective 
the estimated scrap value is used in the computation of depreciation expense and recoverability of the carrying value of each vessel when evaluating for impairment of vessels 
management estimates for salvage values may differ from actual results 
the carrying values of the company vessels may not represent their fair market value at any point in time since the market prices of second hand vessels tend to fluctuate with changes in charter rates and the cost of newbuildings 
historically  both charter rates and vessel values tend to be cyclical 
we evaluate the carrying amounts and periods over which long lived assets are depreciated to determine if events have occurred which would require modification to their carrying values or useful lives 
in evaluating useful lives and carrying values of long lived assets  we review certain indicators of potential impairment  such as undiscounted projected operating cash flows  vessel sales and purchases  business plans and overall market conditions 
we determine undiscounted projected net operating cash flow for each vessel and compare it to the vessel carrying value 
this assessment is made at the individual vessel level since separately identifiable cash flow information for each vessel is available 
in developing estimates of future cash flows  the company must make assumptions about future charter rates  ship operating expenses  and the estimated remaining useful lives of the vessels 
these assumptions are based on historical trends as well as future expectations 
although management believes that the assumptions used to evaluate potential impairment are reasonable and appropriate  such assumptions are highly subjective 
in the event that an impairment were to occur  we would determine the fair value of the related asset and record a charge to operations calculated by comparing the asset carrying value to the estimated fair value 
we estimate fair value primarily through the use of third party valuations performed on an individual vessel basis 
deferred drydock cost there are two methods that are used by the shipping industry to account for drydockings a the deferral method where drydock costs are capitalized when incurred and amortized over the period to the next scheduled drydock  and b expensing drydocking costs in the period it is incurred 
we use the deferral method of accounting for drydock expenses 
under the deferral method  drydock expenses are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis until the next drydock  which we estimate to be a period of two to three years 
we believe the deferral method better matches costs with revenue than expensing the costs as incurred 
we use judgment when estimating the period between drydocks performed  which can result in adjustments to the estimated amortization of drydock expense 
if the vessel is disposed of before the next drydock  the remaining balance in deferral drydock is written off to the gain or loss upon disposal of vessels in the period when contracted 
we expect that our vessels will be required to be drydocked approximately every months 
costs capitalized as part of the drydocking include direct costs that are incurred as part of the drydocking to meet regulatory requirements  or are expenditures that add economic life to the vessel  increase the vessel earnings capacity or improve the vessel efficiency 
direct costs include the shipyard costs  parts  inspection fees  steel  blasting and painting 
expenditures for normal maintenance and repairs  whether incurred as part of the drydocking or not  are expensed as incurred 
unamortized dry docking costs of vessels that are sold are written off and included in the calculation of the resulting gain or loss in the year of the vessels sale 
vessel acquisitions where we identify any intangible assets or liabilities associated with the acquisition of a vessel  we record all identified tangible and intangible assets or liabilities at fair value 
fair value is determined by reference to market data and the amount of expected future cash flows 
we value any asset or liability arising from the market value of the time charters assumed when an acquired vessel is delivered to us 
where we have assumed an existing charter obligation or enter into a time charter with the existing charterer in connection with the purchase of a vessel at charter rates that are less than market charter rates  we record a liability in fair value below contract value of time charters acquired based on the difference between the assumed charter rate and the market charter rate for an equivalent vessel 
conversely  where we assume an existing charter obligation or enter into a time charter with the existing charterer in connection with the purchase of a vessel at charter rates that are above market charter rates  we record an asset in fair value above contract value of time charters acquired  based on the difference between the market charter rate and the contracted charter rate for an equivalent vessel 
this determination is made at the time the vessel is delivered to us  and such assets and liabilities are amortized to revenue over the remaining period of the charter 
the determination of the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities requires us to make significant assumptions and estimates of many variables including market charter rates  expected future charter rates  future vessel operation expenses  the level of utilization of our vessels and our weighted average cost of capital 
the use of different assumptions could result in a material change in the fair value of these items  which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in the event that the market charter rates relating to the acquired vessels are lower than the contracted charter rates at the time of their respective deliveries to us  our net earnings for the remainder of the terms of the charters may be adversely affected although our cash flows will not be so affected 
insurance claims insurance claims are recorded on an accrual basis and represent the claimable expenses  net of deductibles  incurred through each balance sheet date  which are expected to be recovered from insurance companies 
any remaining costs to complete the claims are included in accrued liabilities 
deferred financing costs fees incurred for obtaining new loans or refinancing existing ones are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the life of the related debt 
unamortized deferred financing costs are written off when the related debt is repaid  or there is a reduction in the facility  and such amounts are expensed in the period the repayment or refinancing is made 
results of operations for the years ended december   and factors affecting our results of operations we believe that the important measures for analyzing future trends in our results of operations consist of the following ownership days chartered in under operating lease days total available days operating days fleet utilization ownership days we define ownership days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet has been owned by us 
ownership days are an indicator of the size of our fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that we record during a period 
there were eighteen vessels in the fleet at the beginning of during  we acquired two second hand vessels which delivered in june and september of  and took delivery of three newbuilding vessels in june  october  and november ownership days in increased due to the delivery of four newbuilding vessels  in january  march  october  and december ownership days in increased due to the delivery of twelve newbuilding vessels  reduced by the sale of one vessel in september chartered in under operating lease days the company defines chartered in under operating lease days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which the company chartered in vessels 
the company started to charter in vessels on a spot basis during the fourth quarter of available days we define available days as the number of our ownership days less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off hire due to vessel familiarization upon acquisition  scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee  vessel upgrades or special surveys and drydockings  and the aggregate amount of time that we spend positioning our vessels 
the shipping industry uses available days to measure the number of days in a period during which vessels should be capable of generating revenues 
we drydocked three vessels in  eight vessels in and five vessels in operating days we define operating days as the number of our available days in a period less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off hire due to any reason  including unforeseen circumstances 
the shipping industry uses operating days to measure the aggregate number of days in a period during which vessels actually generate revenues 
fleet utilization we calculate fleet utilization by dividing the number of our operating days during a period by the number of our available days during the period 
the shipping industry uses fleet utilization to measure a company efficiency in finding suitable employment for its vessels and minimizing the amount of days that its vessels are off hire for reasons other than scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee  vessel upgrades  special surveys or vessel positioning 
our fleet continues to perform at very high utilization rates 
tce rates we define tce rates as our voyage and time charter revenues less voyage expenses during a period divided by the number of our available days during the period  which is consistent with industry standards 
tce rate is a standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare daily earnings generated by vessels on time charters with daily earnings generated by vessels on voyage charters  because charter hire rates for vessels on voyage charters are generally not expressed in per day amounts while charter hire rates for vessels on time charters generally are expressed in such amounts 
time charter and voyage revenue shipping revenues are highly sensitive to patterns of supply and demand for vessels of the size and design configurations owned and operated by a company and the trades in which those vessels operate 
in the dry bulk sector of the shipping industry  rates for the transportation of dry bulk cargoes such as ores  grains  steel  fertilizers  and similar commodities  are determined by market forces such as the supply and demand for such commodities  the distance that cargoes must be transported  and the number of vessels expected to be available at the time such cargoes need to be transported 
the demand for shipments then is significantly affected by the state of the economy globally and in discrete geographical areas 
the number of vessels is affected by newbuilding deliveries and by the removal of existing vessels from service  principally because of scrapping 
revenues are also affected by the mix of charters between spot voyage charter and long term time charter 
because shipping revenues and voyage expenses are significantly affected by the mix between voyage charters and time charters  vessel revenues are bench marked on the basis of time charter equivalent tce revenues 
tce revenue comprises revenue from vessels operating on time charters  and voyage revenue less voyage expenses from vessels operating on voyage charters in the spot market 
tce revenue serves as a measure of analyzing fluctuations between financial periods and as a method of equating revenue generated from a voyage charter to time charter revenue 
tce revenue also serves as an industry standard for measuring revenue and comparing results between geographical regions and among competitors 
our economic decisions are based on anticipated tce rates and we evaluate financial performance based on tce rates achieved 
our revenues are driven primarily by the number of vessels in our fleet  the number of days during which our vessels operate and the amount of the daily tce that our vessels earn under charters  which  in turn  are affected by a number of factors  including the duration of our charters  our decisions relating to vessel acquisitions and disposals  the amount of time that we spend positioning our vessels  the amount of time that our vessels spend in dry dock undergoing repairs  maintenance and upgrade work  the age  condition and specifications of our vessels  levels of supply and demand in the dry bulk shipping industry  and other factors affecting spot market charter rates for dry bulk carriers 
our revenues for the year ended december  were earned from time charters and voyage charters 
all our revenues for the years ended december  and were earned from time charters 
as is common in the shipping industry  we pay commissions ranging from to of the total daily charter hire rate of each charter to unaffiliated ship brokers and in house brokers associated with the charterers  depending on the number of brokers involved with arranging the charter 
net revenues for the year ended december  of  which is comprised of billed time charter revenues and voyage revenues of  amortization of fair value below contract value of time charters acquired of  and deductions for brokerage commissions of  net revenues for the year ended december  were greater than net revenues for the year ended december   primarily due to the operation of larger fleet as reflected by the increased operating days  and an increase in daily time charter rates 
net revenues for the year ended december  of  which is comprised of billed time charter revenues of  amortization of fair value below contract value of time charters acquired of  and deductions for brokerage commissions of  while  net revenues for the year ended december  were greater than net revenues for the year ended december   the positive impact of a larger fleet size was offset by a decrease in time charter rates earned by the fleet 
net revenues for the year ended december  of  included billed time charter revenues of  amortization of fair value below contract value of time charters acquired of  and deductions for brokerage commissions of  net revenues for the year ended december  were greater than net revenues for the year ended december   primarily due to a larger fleet size  as reflected by the increased operating days  and an increase in daily time charter rates 
voyage expenses to the extent that we employ our vessels on voyage charters  we will incur expenses that include bunkers  port charges  canal tolls  cargo handling operations and brokerage commissions  as these expenses are borne by the vessel owner on voyage charters 
bunkers  port charges  canal tolls expenses primarily increase in periods during which vessels are employed on voyage charters because these expenses are for the account of the vessels 
vessel expenses vessel expenses for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
vessel expenses increase due to increases in the fleet size from vessels in  to vessels in  and to vessels in vessel expenses in included  in vessel operating costs and  in technical management fees 
during  vessel expenses also increased due to increases in vessel crew costs  insurance costs  costs relating to anti piracy measures  and general increases in costs of stores and spares 
vessel expenses for the year ended december  included  in vessel operating costs and  in technical management fees 
vessel expenses for the year ended december  included  in vessel operating costs and  in technical management fees 
vessel expenses in increased due to increases in vessel crew costs  increase in insurance costs  and increases in lube costs which are based on global oil prices 
vessel operating expenses include crew wages and related costs  the cost of insurance  expenses relating to repairs and maintenance  the cost of spares and consumable stores  tonnage taxes  other miscellaneous expenses  and technical management fees 
insurance expense varies with overall insurance market conditions as well as the insured loss record  level of insurance and desired coverage 
the main insurance expenses include hull and machinery insurance ie asset insurance costs and protection and indemnity p i insurance ie liability insurance costs  certain other insurances  such as basic war risk premiums based on voyages into designated war risk areas are often for the account of the charterers 
with regard to vessel operating expenses  we have entered into technical management agreements for some of our vessels with our independent technical managers  v

in conjunction with our management  our managers have established an operating expense budget for each vessel 
all deviations from the budgeted amounts are for our account 
included in vessel expenses is a daily fixed management fee for each vessel in our operating fleet paid to our independent technical managers

technical management services include managing day to day vessel operations  performing general vessel maintenance  ensuring regulatory and classification society compliance  supervising the maintenance and general efficiency of vessels  arranging the hire of qualified officers and crew  arranging dry docking and repairs  purchasing stores  supplies  spare parts and new equipment  appointing supervisors and technical consultants and providing technical support 
our vessel expenses  which generally represent costs under the vessel operating budgets  cost of insurance and vessel registry and other regulatory fees  will increase with the enlargement of our fleet 
other factors beyond our control  some of which may affect the shipping industry in general  may also cause these expenses to increase  including  for instance  developments relating to market prices for crew  insurance and petroleum based lubricants and supplies

total depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  includes  of vessel depreciation and  of amortization of deferred drydocking costs 
total depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  includes  of vessel depreciation and  of amortization of deferred drydocking costs 
the cost of our vessels is depreciated on a straight line basis over the expected useful life of each vessel 
depreciation is based on the cost of the vessel less its estimated residual value 
we estimate the useful life of our vessels to be years from the date of initial delivery from the shipyard to the original owner 
furthermore  we estimate the residual values of our vessels to be per lightweight ton  which we believe is common in the dry bulk shipping industry 
our depreciation charges will increase as our fleet expands 
drydocking relates to our regularly scheduled maintenance program necessary to preserve the quality of our vessels as well as to comply with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations 
management anticipates that vessels are to be drydocked every two and a half years and  accordingly  these expenses are deferred and amortized over that period 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses include onshore vessel administration related expenses such as legal and professional expenses and recurring administrative and other expenses including payroll and expenses relating to our executive officers and office staff  office rent and expenses  directors fees  and directors and officers insurance

capitalized interest in amounted to  which includes  in interest and commitment fees  and  in amortization of financing costs 
capitalized interest in amounted to  which includes  in interest and commitment fees  and  in amortization of financing costs 
the increase in capitalized interest is substantially due to additional borrowings to fund the construction of the newbuilding vessels and the increase in margins 
cash paid for capitalized interest during   and amounted to   and  respectively 
interest rate swaps we have entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert a portion of our debt from a floating to a fixed rate basis 
under these swap contracts  exclusive of applicable margins  we pay fixed rate interest and receive floating rate interest amounts based on three month libor settings 
the swaps are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges 
as of december   the following swap contracts were outstanding notional amount outstanding december  fixed rate maturity we record the fair value of the interest rate swaps as an asset or liability on the balance sheet 
the effective portion of the swap is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
accordingly    and  have been recorded in fair value of derivative instruments liabilities in the company balance sheets as of december   and  respectively 
foreign currency swaps the shipping industry functional currency is the us dollar 
all our revenues and the majority of our operating expenses and the entirety of our management expenses are in us dollars 
therefore we do not use or intend to use financial derivatives to mitigate the risk of exchange rate fluctuations for our revenues and expenses 
however  as we entered into a newbuilding program for vessels to be built in japan and which are priced in japanese yen  we have entered into foreign exchange swap transactions to hedge foreign currency risks to our vessel newbuilding contracts 
these swaps are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges 
at december   the company had outstanding foreign currency swap contracts for notional amounts aggregating billion japanese yen swapped into the equivalent of  in february  the company fixed the gain on its outstanding foreign currency swaps contracts 
this gain was recognized upon delivery of the remaining vessels as an offset to the cost of the vessels

the remaining gain as of december  aggregating  was offset the cost of the remaining two vessels upon their delivery in january  and february the company records the fair value of the currency swaps as an asset or liability in its financial statements 
the effective portion of the swap is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
accordingly  an amount of   and  has been recorded in fair value of derivative instruments in the accompanying financial statements as of december    and  respectively 
write off of advances for vessel construction in december  we reached an agreement with yangzhou dayang shipbuilding co  ltd  to convert eight charter free supramax vessel construction contracts in our newbuilding program into options on the part of the company  for consideration of  the carrying value of the advanced payment in connection with the acquisition of these construction contracts from kyrini shipping inc and the cost of the eight newly converted shipbuilding contract options were in excess of the fair value of the eight options  and as such  we recorded an impairment charge of  gain on sale of vessel during  the company decided to sell the oldest and smallest vessel in its fleet  the griffon  a built handymax

ebitda ebitda represents operating earnings before extraordinary items  depreciation and amortization  interest expense  and income taxes  if any 
ebitda is included because it is used by certain investors to measure a company financial performance 
ebitda is not an item recognized by gaap and should not be considered a substitute for net income  cash flow from operating activities and other operations or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or as a measure of profitability or liquidity 
ebitda is presented to provide additional information with respect to the company ability to satisfy its obligations including debt service  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements 
while ebitda is frequently used as a measure of operating results and the ability to meet debt service requirements  the definition of ebitda used here may not be comparable to that used by other companies due to differences in methods of calculation 
our revolving credit facility permits us to pay dividends in amounts up to cumulative free cash flows which is our earnings before extraordinary or exceptional items  interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization credit agreement ebitda  less the aggregate amount of interest incurred and net amounts payable under interest rate hedging agreements during the relevant period and an agreed upon reserve for dry docking 
therefore  we believe that this non gaap measure is important for our investors as it reflects our ability to pay dividends 
following an amendment to the revolving credit facility in december  payment of dividends has been suspended until certain covenants requirements have been met and until our board of directors determines in its discretion to declare and pay future dividends

we will rely on operating cash flows as well as our revolving credit facility and possible additional equity and debt financing alternatives to fund our long term capital requirements for vessel construction and implement future growth plans 
in december  our board of directors suspended the payment of dividends to stockholders in order to increase cash flow  optimize financial flexibility and enhance internal growth 
our loan agreements for our borrowings are secured by liens on our vessels and contain various financial covenants 
the covenants relate to our financial position  operating performance and liquidity 
the market value of dry bulk vessels is sensitive  among other things  to changes in the dry bulk charter market 
the recent general decline in the dry bulk carrier charter market has resulted in lower charter rates for vessels in the dry bulk market 
the decline in charter rates in the dry bulk market coupled with the prevailing difficulty in obtaining financing for vessel purchases have adversely affected dry bulk vessel values 
a continuation of these conditions  could lead to a significant decline in the fair market values of our vessels  which could impact our compliance with these loan covenants 
the recent developments in the credit markets and related impact on the dry bulk charter market and have also resulted in additional risks 
the occurrence of one or more of these risk factors could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
please refer to the section entitled risk factors in part i of this document 
it is our intention to fund our future acquisition related capital requirements initially through borrowings under the amended revolving credit facility and to repay all or a portion of such borrowings from time to time with cash generated from operations and from net proceeds of issuances of securities

depending on market conditions in the dry bulk shipping industry and acquisition opportunities that may arise  we may be required to obtain additional debt or equity financing which could affect our dividend policy 
in this connection  the dry bulk market has recently declined substantially 
in december  commencing with the fourth quarter of  the company board of directors has determined to suspend the payment of dividends to stockholders in order to increase cash flow  optimize financial flexibility and enhance internal growth 
in the future  the declaration and payment of dividends  if any  will always be subject to the discretion of the board of directors  restrictions contained in the amended credit facility and the requirements of marshall islands law 
the timing and amount of any dividends declared will depend on  among other things  the company earnings  financial condition and cash requirements and availability  the ability to obtain debt and equity financing on acceptable terms as contemplated by the company growth strategy  the terms of its outstanding indebtedness and the ability of the company subsidiaries to distribute funds to it

management anticipates that vessels are to be drydocked every two and a half years 
funding of these requirements is anticipated to be met with cash from operations 
we anticipate that this process of recertification will require us to reposition these vessels from a discharge port to shipyard facilities  which will reduce our available days and operating days during that period
