the market for networking infrastructure solutions is concentrated among large oems  and as such  a significant portion of our revenues are generated from sales to a limited number of customers 
as of july   we had a total of employees 
we use a to week fiscal year that ends on the sunday nearest to june therefore  every fifth or sixth fiscal year will be a week fiscal year 
fiscal comprised of weeks and ended on july  fiscal years and each comprised weeks and ended on june  and june   respectively 
globalization initiatives as part of our globalization initiatives  we created an irish subsidiary to expand our international operations by providing local customer service and support to our customers outside of the united states in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  emulex granted an intellectual property license and entered into a research and development cost sharing agreement with its subsidiary in the isle of man 
the terms of the license require that the subsidiary make prepayments of expected royalties to a us subsidiary  the first of which was paid before the end of fiscal in the amount of approximately million for expected royalties relating to fiscal through in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the subsidiary made the second prepayment of approximately million for expected royalties relating to fiscal through these globalization initiatives are expected to continue as we endeavor to respond to the changing needs of our customers 
during the second quarter of fiscal  one of our domestic entities entered into a technology platform contribution transaction with one of our international subsidiaries to license the recently acquired serverengines technology for approximately million 
while these global initiatives are expected to continue to reduce our effective tax rate beginning with fiscal year  the technology platform contribution transaction resulted in incremental tax expense of approximately million in fiscal year our cash balances and investments are held in numerous locations throughout the world 
as of july   our international subsidiaries held approximately of our total cash  cash equivalents and investment securities  the majority of which will be used to repay obligations to us affiliate entities that arise in the normal course of business

for fiscal year  our fibre channel based products accounted for most of our hsp revenues 
the increase in our hsp net revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in units shipped of approximately partially offset by a decrease in average selling price of approximately 
the significant increase in units shipped and decrease in average selling price was primarily due to the inclusion of sales resulting from the acquisition of serverengines on august   which accounted for no revenues in the prior year and the products of which had a significantly lower average selling price compared to other emulex products  as well as significant increased unit shipments of ulom and ucna products 
esp primarily consists of our inspeed  fibrespy  i o controller solutions  and bridge and router products 
the decrease in our esp net revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in the number of units shipped of approximately 
the decrease in units shipped was primarily due to the decline in certain legacy products partially offset by the increased volumes from our bridging and target design wins 
our other category primarily consists of legacy and other products 
net revenues by major customers in addition to direct sales  some of our larger oem customers purchase or market products indirectly through distributors  resellers or other third parties 
if these indirect sales are purchases of customer specific models  we are able to track these sales 
however  if these indirect sales are purchases of our standard models  we are not able to distinguish them by oem customer 
customers whose direct net revenues  or total direct and indirect net revenues including customer specific models purchased or marketed indirectly through distributors  resellers and other third parties  exceeded of our fiscal year net revenues were as follows net revenues by major customers total direct direct and indirect revenues revenues net revenue percentage oem emc hewlett packard ibm amounts less than are not presented

direct and indirect sales to our top five customers accounted for approximately and of total net revenues for fiscal years and  respectively 
our net revenues from customers can be significantly impacted by changes to our customers business and their business models 
net revenues by sales channel net revenues by sales channel were as follows net revenues by sales channel percentage of percentage of increase percentage net revenues net revenues decrease change dollars in thousands oem distribution other total net revenues the increase in oem net revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase of approximately in hsp revenues generated through our oems 
distribution net revenues for fiscal did not change significantly compared to fiscal we believe that our net revenues are driven by product certifications and qualifications with our oem customers  which take products directly and indirectly through distribution and contract manufacturers 
we view product certifications and qualifications as an important indicator of future revenue opportunities and growth for the company 
however  product certifications and qualifications do not necessarily ensure continued market acceptance of our products by our oem customers 
it is also very difficult to determine the future impact  if any  of product certifications and qualifications on our revenues 
net revenues by geographic territory our net revenues by geographic territory based on billed to location were as follows net revenues by geographic territory percentage of percentage of increase percentage net revenues net revenues decrease change dollars in thousands asia pacific united states europe  middle east  and africa rest of the world total net revenues we believe the significant decrease in europe  middle east  and africa net revenues and the significant increase in asia pacific net revenues in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to our oem customers migrating production to contract manufacturers located predominantly in asia pacific 
however  as we sell to oems and distributors who ultimately resell our products to their customers  the geographic mix of our net revenues may not be reflective of the geographic mix of end user demand or installations 
gross profit 
gross profit consists of net revenues less cost of sales 
our gross profit for fiscal and fiscal were as follows in thousands gross profit percentage of percentage of increase percentage net revenues net revenues decrease points change cost of sales includes the cost of producing  supporting  and managing our supply of quality finished products

approximately million and million of share based compensation expense was included in cost of sales for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the remaining change was primarily due to an unfavorable mix of lower margin products sold in fiscal we expect the trend toward increased sales of lower margin products to continue into the future 
engineering and development 
engineering and development expenses consisted primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in the design  development  and support of our products 
these expenses included third party fees paid to consultants  prototype development expenses  and computer service costs related to supporting computer tools used in the design process

engineering and development headcount increased to at the end of fiscal from at the end of fiscal  primarily due to the acquisition of serverengines 
the increase in headcount resulted in a net increase of approximately million in salary and related expenses compared to fiscal the remaining increase was primarily due to an increase in costs associated with new product development of approximately million and an increase in performance based compensation of approximately million 
we plan to continue to invest in engineering and development costs

our non operating expense income  net for fiscal and fiscal was as follows in thousands non operating expense income  net percentage of percentage of increase percentage net revenues net revenues decrease points chang our non operating income  net  for fiscal compared to fiscal decreased approximately million  or 
the net decrease was primarily due to the impairment of our equity investment in a privately held company of approximately million 
during fiscal  the business climate of the privately held company deteriorated significantly as the technology was no longer expected to be designed into customer products and was determined to be other than temporary and thus  the fair value of our equity investment in the privately held company was deemed to be zero 
as a result  the entire investment of approximately million in the privately held company was impaired 
income taxes 
income tax provision benefit for fiscal and fiscal was as follows in thousands income taxes percentage of percentage of increase percentage net revenues net revenues decrease points change income taxes for fiscal compared to fiscal increased approximately million  or

our fiscal effective tax rate was also impacted by an increase in our valuation allowance related to our capital loss carryforwards  california and massachusetts research credits  and other california deferred tax assets  net of unrecognized tax benefits  of approximately million  and an increase in taxes from non deductible stock based compensation expense for contingent shares related to the serverengines acquisition of approximately million 
the increase in income taxes was partially offset by an increase in tax benefits due to changes in the geographic mix of taxable income between domestic and foreign jurisdictions of approximately million  an increase in state tax benefits  excluding the impact of the state valuation allowance  of approximately million  an increase in tax benefits from federal research credits due to a retroactive extension of the federal research credit in december as part of the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of of approximately million  and an increase in tax benefit related to a release of fin liabilities as a result of an expiration of statute of limitations of approximately million 
in addition  the fiscal effective tax rate included a non recurring tax benefit related to domestic production activities deduction for tax years through of approximately million and a non recurring tax benefit to the stock option exchange program of approximately million 
these tax items may not reoccur in future periods 
as a result of the global scope of our operations and the complexity of global tax and transfer pricing rules and regulations  the tax liabilities in each of the countries in which we operate may differ materially from our estimates and impact our expected tax rate in the future 
in addition  our future effective tax rate may be impacted by other items including newly enacted tax legislation  stock based compensation  uncertain tax positions and examinations by various tax authorities

tax benefits from federal research credits were lower during fiscal compared to fiscal due to the expiration of the federal research credit on december  and the retroactive extension of the federal research credit in october as part of the emergency economic stabilization act of critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of net revenues  expenses  assets  and liabilities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties 
changes in judgments and uncertainties relating to these estimates could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
if these estimates differ significantly from actual results  the impact to the consolidated financial statements may be material 
we believe that the critical accounting policies that are the most significant for purposes of fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition 
we generally recognize revenue at the time of shipment when title and risk of loss have passed  evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured basic revenue recognition criteria 
we make certain sales through two tier distribution channels and have various distribution agreements with selected distributors and master value added resellers collectively  the distributors 
these distribution agreements may be terminated upon written notice by either party 
additionally  these distributors are generally given privileges to return a portion of inventory and to participate in price protection and cooperative marketing programs 
therefore  we recognize revenue on our standard products sold to our distributors based on data received from the distributors and management s estimates to approximate the point that these products have been resold by the distributors 
oem specific models sold to our distributors are governed under the related oem agreements rather than under these distribution agreements 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment for oem specific products shipped to the distributors when the basic revenue recognition criteria have been met 
additionally  we maintain sales related reserves for our sales incentive programs 
we classify the costs of these incentive programs based on the benefit received  if applicable  as a reduction of revenue  a cost of sale  or an operating expense 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical write offs as a percentage of net revenues and management s review of outstanding accounts receivable 
amounts due from customers are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts when management believes that collectibility of the amount is unlikely 
although we have not historically experienced significant losses on accounts receivable  our accounts receivable are concentrated with a small number of customers 
consequently  any write off associated with one of these customers could have a significant impact on our allowance for doubtful accounts and results of operations 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost  on a first in  first out basis  or market 
we use a standard cost system to determine cost 
the standard costs are adjusted periodically to represent actual cost 
we regularly compare forecasted demand and the composition of the forecast against inventory on hand and open purchase commitments in an effort to ensure that the carrying value of inventory does not exceed net realizable value 
accordingly  we may have to reduce the carrying value of excess and obsolete inventory if forecasted demand decreases 
intangible assets and other long lived assets 
intangible assets resulting from acquisitions or licensing agreements are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment charges  if any 
for assets with determinable useful lives  amortization is computed using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the respective intangible assets  ranging from ten months to twelve years 
furthermore  we assess whether our long lived assets  including intangible assets and equity investment in a privately held company recorded under the cost method  should be tested for recoverability periodically and whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured based on fair value  which is determined using projected discounted future operating cash flows 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 
goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized  but instead is tested at least annually for impairment  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
management considers our business as a whole to be its reporting unit for purposes of testing for impairment 
this impairment test is performed annually during the fourth fiscal quarter 
a two step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired  otherwise  goodwill is impaired and the loss is measured by performing step two 
under step two  the impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill 
as of the date of the fiscal impairment test  the fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value  therefore  we were not at risk of failing the first step of the two step test for potential impairment 
subsequent to the date of the fiscal impairment test  our stock price has declined 
if our stock price continues to decline  our goodwill may become impaired 
the purchase price allocation related to the serverengines acquisition that was completed on august  was recorded in fiscal  adding approximately million to goodwill 
we will continue to monitor whether there are potential indicators of impairment 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  under which we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
tax positions that meet a more likely than not recognition threshold are recognized in the financial statements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is recorded by the company against any deferred tax assets when  in the judgment of management  it is more likely than not that all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to complex tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment  and uncertainty 
tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional liabilities or potentially to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
stock based compensation 
we account for our stock based awards to employees and non employees using the fair value method 
stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
although we grant both unvested stock awards and stock options  the majority of the awards granted and stock based compensation recognized consists of unvested stock awards 
the fair value of each unvested stock award is determined based on the closing price of our common stock at grant date 
for stock options  the measurement of stock based compensation cost is based on several criteria including  but not limited to  the valuation model used and associated input factors principally stock price volatility and award forfeiture rate and  to a lesser extent  expected term  dividend rate  and risk free interest rate 
the input factors used in the valuation model are based on subjective future expectations combined with management judgment 
if there is a difference between the forfeiture assumptions used in determining stock based compensation costs and the actual forfeitures  which become known over time  we may change the assumptions used in determining stock based compensation costs 
these changes may materially impact our results of operations in the period such changes are made 
see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item a of this annual report on form k for additional information and related disclosures 
litigation costs 
we record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for a loss contingency when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
legal and other litigation related costs are recognized as the services are provided 
we record insurance recoveries for litigation costs for which both conditions are met i the recovery is probable and ii collectability is reasonably assured 
the insurance recoveries recorded are only to the extent the litigation costs have been incurred and recognized in the financial statements  however  it is reasonably possible that the actual recovery may be significantly different from our estimates 
there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and we cannot provide assurance that any actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation or substantial settlement charges 
if any of those events were to occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

prospective capital needs in early august  our board of directors authorized a plan to repurchase up to million of our outstanding common stock 
in april  upon receipt of an unsolicited takeover proposal and related tender offer of broadcom corporation to acquire us  our board of directors elected to temporarily suspend any activity under the share repurchase plan 
in light of broadcom allowing its tender offer to expire on july   emulex s board of directors elected to reactivate the million share repurchase plan effective july  from june  through july   the company repurchased million shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million or an average of per share under this plan  of which approximately million shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million or an average of was purchased in fiscal subsequent to fiscal year ended july   we repurchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million or an average of per share 
our board of directors has not set an expiration date for the plan 
therefore  we may repurchase additional shares under this plan from time to time through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions 
it is expected that any future share repurchases will be financed by available cash and cash from operations 
as part of our global initiatives  we currently plan to continue our strategic investment in research and development  sales and marketing  capital equipment  and facilities 
we may also consider internal and external investment opportunities in order to achieve our growth and market leadership goals  including licensing and joint development agreements with our suppliers  customers  and other third parties 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  current investments  and anticipated cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to support our working capital needs  capital expenditure requirements and stock repurchasing expenditures for at least the next months 
we currently do not have any outstanding lines of credit or other borrowings 
we have disclosed outstanding legal proceedings in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item a of this annual report on form k

under local rules and court order  we have a scheduled mediation with broadcom for august  trial is scheduled to begin september  while we have contractual commitments from our suppliers for the defense and indemnification of certain broadcom claims relating to certain technology provided by our suppliers  it cannot be certain that such defense and indemnification obligations will be promptly honored by our suppliers 
this lawsuit continues to present risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations  including loss of patent rights  monetary damages  and injunction against the sale of accused products 
we have been presenting a vigorous defense against this lawsuit  but management is unable to determine whether any loss will occur or to estimate the range of such loss 
therefore  no amount of loss has been accrued 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of july   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of july   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity in future periods 
the estimated payments reflected in this table are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the actual cash outflows in future periods will vary  possibly materially  from those reflected in the table

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
interest rate sensitivity our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to their short terms to maturity 
as of july   the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value 
as of july   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed income securities of approximately million 
we have the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity 
we did not hold any auction rate securities or direct investments in mortgage backed securities as of july  the fair market value of our investment portfolio is subject to interest rate risk and would decline in value if market interest rates increased 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels existing as of july   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material to our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
however  if interest rates decreased and securities within our portfolio were re invested in securities with lower interest rates  interest income would decrease in the future
