item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we derive revenues from memberships to our research products and services  performing advisory services and consulting projects and hosting events 
we offer contracts for our research products that are typically renewable annually and payable in advance 
research revenues are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the contract 
accordingly  a substantial portion of our billings are initially recorded as deferred revenue 
clients purchase advisory services independently and or to supplement their memberships to our research 
billings attributable to advisory services and consulting projects are initially recorded as deferred revenue 
advisory service revenues are recognized when the customer receives the agreed upon deliverable 
consulting project revenues  which generally are short term in nature and based upon fixed fee agreements  are recognized as the services are provided 
event billings are also initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue upon completion of each event 
our primary operating expenses consist of cost of services and fulfillment  selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses 
cost of services and fulfillment represents the costs associated with the production and delivery of our products and services  including salaries  bonuses  employee benefits and stock based compensation expense for research personnel and all associated editorial  travel  and support services 
selling and marketing expenses include salaries  sales commissions  bonuses  employee benefits  stock based compensation expense  travel expenses  promotional costs and other costs incurred in marketing and selling our products and services 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of the technology  operations  finance  and human resources groups and our other administrative functions  including salaries  bonuses  employee benefits  and stock based compensation expense 
overhead costs such as facilities are allocated to these categories according to the number of employees in each group 
deferred revenue  agreement value  client retention  dollar retention and enrichment are metrics we believe are important to understanding our business 
we believe that the amount of deferred revenue  along with the agreement value of contracts to purchase research and advisory services  provide a significant measure of our business activity 
we define these metrics as follows deferred revenue billings in advance of revenue recognition as of the measurement date 
agreement value the total revenues recognizable from all research and advisory service contracts in force at a given time but not including advisory only contracts  without regard to how much revenue has already been recognized 
agreement value excludes amounts in excess of the first year value for multiple year contracts signed in and beyond 
no single client accounted for more than of agreement value at december  client retention the percentage of client companies with memberships expiring during the most recent twelve month period that renewed one or more of those memberships during that same period 
dollar retention the percentage of the dollar value of all client membership contracts renewed during the most recent twelve month period to the total dollar value of all client membership contracts that expired during the period 
enrichment the percentage of the dollar value of client membership contracts renewed during the period to the dollar value of the corresponding expiring contracts 
client retention  dollar retention  and enrichment are not necessarily indicative of the rate of future retention of our revenue base 
a summary of our key metrics is as follows dollars in millions as of absolute percentage december  increase increase decrease decrease deferred revenue agreement value client retention dollar retention enrichment number of clients as of absolute percentage december  increase increase decrease decrease deferred revenue agreement value client retention dollar retention enrichment number of clients the increase in deferred revenue and agreement value from to is primarily due to increased demand for our products and services due to the improvement in the economy and an increase in the number of sales people during the increase in agreement value was partially offset by a change in the calculation to exclude agreement value in excess of the first year for multiple year contracts signed in and beyond  which reduced the growth rate in by approximately 
client retention and enrichment metrics increased in which is consistent with an improved economic environment and is also due to increased sales performance in the increase in deferred revenue from to is primarily due to increased demand for our products due to the improvement in the economy in the fourth quarter of compared to as well as the effect of the jupiterresearch and strategic oxygen acquisitions completed in july and december  respectively 
see note acquisitions of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in agreement value from to is reflective of the economic downturn in the second half of through the majority of which resulted in a lower number of clients and lower enrichment rates in compared to and also is due to the exclusion in of agreement value in excess of the first year value for multiple year contracts signed in client and dollar retention amounts were essentially flat in compared to critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our policies and estimates  including but not limited to  those related to our revenue recognition  stock based compensation  non marketable investments  goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes and valuation and impairment of marketable investments 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  data available at the time the estimates are made and various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be those that require the most subjective judgment or that involve uncertainty that could have a material impact on our financial statements 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
this is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap  with no need for management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
for a discussion of our other accounting policies  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f revenue recognition 
we generate revenues from licensing memberships to our research  performing advisory services and consulting projects and hosting events 
we execute contracts that govern the terms and conditions of each arrangement 
revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  services have been provided to the customer and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenues from contracts that contain multiple deliverables are allocated among the separate units based on their relative fair values  however  the amount recognized is limited to the amount that is not contingent on future performance conditions 
research service revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
advisory service revenues are recognized when the customer receives the agreed upon deliverable and consulting project revenues are recognized as the services are provided 
reimbursed out of pocket expenses are recorded as advisory service revenues 
events revenues are recognized upon completion of the event 
annual subscriptions to our roleview research  which include access to all or a designated portion of our research  and depending on the type of license  membership in one or more of our forrester leadership boards  unlimited phone or email analyst inquiry  unlimited participation in forrester teleconferences  and the right to attend one event  are accounted for as one unit of accounting and recognized ratably as research services revenue over the membership period 
annual subscriptions to our data products include access to designated survey data products and access to a data specialist  and are accounted for as one unit of accounting and recognized ratably as research services revenue over the membership period 
we offer our clients a service guarantee  which gives our clients the right to cancel their contracts prior to the end of the contract term and receive a refund for unused products or services 
furthermore  our revenue recognition determines the timing of commission expenses  as commissions are earned during the month a contract is booked and are deferred and recognized as expense as the related revenue is recognized 
we evaluate the recoverability of deferred commissions at each balance sheet date 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation is recognized as an expense based upon the fair value of the award at the time of grant 
the determination of the fair value of stock based compensation requires significant judgment and the use of estimates  particularly surrounding assumptions such as stock price volatility  expected option lives and forfeiture rates 
these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if circumstances change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
expected volatility is based  in part  on the historical volatility of our common stock as well as management s expectations of future volatility over the expected term of the awards granted 
the development of an expected life assumption involves projecting employee exercise behaviors expected period between stock option vesting dates and stock option exercise dates 
we are also required to estimate future forfeitures of stock based awards for recognition of compensation expense 
we will record additional expense if the actual forfeitures are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior recognized expense if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated 
in addition  for our performance vested restricted stock units  we make estimates of the performance outcome at each period end in order to estimate the actual number of shares that will be earned and or the vesting period of the award 
the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate or performance outcomes are materially different from our estimate  the actual stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
non marketable investments 
we hold minority interests in technology related investment funds with a book value of million at december  these investment funds are not publicly traded  and  therefore  because no established market for these securities exists  the estimate of the fair value of our investments requires significant judgment 
investments that are accounted for using the cost method are valued at cost unless an other than temporary impairment in their value occurs 
for investments that are accounted for using the equity method  we record our share of the investee s operating results each period 
we review the fair value of our investments on a regular basis to evaluate whether an other than temporary impairment in the investment has occurred 
we record impairment charges when we believe that an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets 
as of december   we had million of goodwill and intangible assets with finite lives recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
goodwill is required to be measured for impairment at least annually or whenever events indicate that there may be an impairment 
in order to determine if an impairment exists  we compare each of our reporting unit s carrying value to the reporting unit s fair value 
determining the reporting unit s fair value requires us to make estimates of market conditions and operational performance 
absent an event that indicates a specific impairment may exist  we have selected november as the date to perform the annual goodwill impairment test 
we completed the annual goodwill impairment testing as of november  and concluded that the fair values of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
intangible assets with finite lives consist of acquired customer relationships  technology  research content and trademarks and are valued according to the future cash flows they are estimated to produce 
these assigned values are amortized on a basis which best matches the periods in which the economic benefits are expected to be realized 
tangible assets with finite lives consist of property and equipment  which are depreciated and amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of our intangible and long lived tangible assets may warrant revision or that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired 
to compute whether intangible assets have been impaired  the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for the estimated remaining useful life of the assets are compared to the carrying value 
to the extent that the future cash flows are less than the carrying value  the assets are written down to their estimated fair value 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as operating loss carryforwards from acquisitions 
such amounts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred taxes to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
as a global company  we use significant judgment to calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are transactions and calculations undertaken whose ultimate tax outcome cannot be certain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of transfer pricing for transactions with our subsidiaries and potential challenges to nexus and credit estimates 
we estimate our exposure to unfavorable outcomes related to these uncertainties and record a liability based on the probability for such outcomes in accordance with current accounting guidelines 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions  returns  and accruals 
such differences  or changes in estimates relating to potential differences  could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such a determination is made 
valuation and impairment of marketable investments 
our investment portfolio may at any time contain investments in us treasury and us government agency securities  taxable and or tax exempt municipal notes some of which may have an auction reset feature  corporate notes and bonds  commercial paper and money market funds 
the assessment of the fair value of certain of the debt securities can be difficult and subjective due in part to limited trading activity of certain of these debt instruments 
we conduct periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss  in accordance with the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  as required under current accounting standards 
an unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis 
unrealized losses on available for sale securities that are determined to be temporary  and not related to credit loss  are recorded  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
for available for sale debt securities with unrealized losses  management performs an analysis to assess whether we intend to sell or whether we would more likely than not be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis 
where we intend to sell a security  or may be required to do so  the security s decline in fair value would be deemed to be other than temporary and the full amount of the unrealized loss would be recorded within gains losses on investments  net in the consolidated statements of income 
regardless of our intent to sell a security  we perform additional analysis on all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate losses associated with the creditworthiness of the security 
credit losses are identified where we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of a security and would be recorded within gains losses on investments  net in the consolidated statements of income 
as of december   we held municipal bonds with a fair value of million million at par value with an auction reset feature auction rate securities or ars 
the fair value of the ars was determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow approach 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates  based on data available at december   of interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows  credit and liquidity premiums  and expected holding periods of the ars 
the assumptions used in valuing the ars are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change  which may lead us in the future to recorded additional losses for these securities 
we classified these ars as available for sale securities and determined that the losses were not considered other than temporary and were not due to credit losses 
accordingly  changes in the market value of the ars have been recorded in other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets during the years ended december  and if the market conditions deteriorate further  we may be required to record unrealized losses in other comprehensive loss or impairment charges within the consolidated statements of income 
we may not be able to liquidate these investments unless the issuer calls the security  a successful auction occurs  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  or the security matures 
results of operations for the years ended december   and the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of income as a percentage of total revenues for the years noted

the effects of foreign exchange resulted in an approximate decrease in total revenues during revenue growth in was driven by a increase in the technology industry client group approximately due to strategic oxygen  a increase in the marketing and strategy client group and a increase for events 
revenue in the information technology group was essentially flat for the year 
overall revenue growth was due in part to the improvement in the economy and an increase in the number of sales personnel in revenue growth in the us outpaced the growth in europe  due in part to a stronger economy in the us relative to europe  resulting in a decrease of in the percentage of revenue earned outside of the us taking into account the increase in deferred revenue of approximately at december  compared to december  and the increase in the number of sales personnel in  we anticipate that revenue growth will accelerate in cost of services and fulfillment absolute percentage increase increase decrease decrease cost of services and fulfillment dollars in millions cost of services and fulfillment as a percentage of total revenues number of research and fulfillment employees at end of period the increase in the dollar amount of cost of services and fulfillment during is primarily the result of increased compensation and benefit costs resulting from an increase in the number of employees and an increase in incentive compensation  increased travel related costs and costs resulting from the acquisition of strategic oxygen in december this increase was partially offset by stock based compensation expense in from the accelerated vesting of performance based stock options 
we expect facility lease costs to increase by approximately million in  of which approximately million will be recorded as cost of services and fulfillment in the increase in facility lease costs will primarily result from our move into our new corporate headquarters in cambridge  massachusetts in the third quarter of of the million increase  approximately million represents lease costs for the period in for which we have access to our new cambridge headquarters for construction purposes until the time that we occupy the facility for operations 
selling and marketing absolute percentage increase increase decrease decrease selling and marketing expenses dollars in millions selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues selling and marketing employees at end of period the increase in selling and marketing expenses in dollars and as a percentage of total revenues during is primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefit costs resulting from an increase in the number of selling and marketing employees and an increase in sales commissions and bonuses 
the increase is also attributable to increased travel related costs 
subject to the business environment for our products and services  we have an ongoing initiative to expand our sales force by to annually 
increased sales of our syndicated research services products attributable to an expanding sales force are generally recognized over a twelve month period  which typically results in an increase in selling and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue during periods of sales force expansion

in addition  the effective tax rate was reduced by a reduction in a valuation allowance on foreign deferred tax assets that did not recur in liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through funds generated from operations 
memberships for research services  which constituted approximately of our revenues during  are annually renewable and are generally payable in advance 
we generated cash from operating activities of million during and million during the decrease in cash provided from operations is primarily attributable to a lower amount of cash generated from working capital in of million compared to million in  primarily due to the timing of income tax payments 
during  we generated million of cash from investing activities  consisting primarily of million in proceeds from net sales and maturities of marketable investments  which was partially offset by million of property and equipment purchases 
property and equipment purchases in primarily consisted of leasehold improvements for new facilities as well as purchases of software and computer equipment 
during  we anticipate spending between million and million for property and equipment purchases  a majority of which will be utilized for the build out and equipping of our new headquarters in cambridge  massachusetts 
at december   we had million in escrow  recorded as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets  which will be utilized to pay for a portion of the build out of our new headquarters 
during  we used million of cash in investing activities  consisting primarily of million used for net purchases of marketable investments and a million increase in restricted cash 
the restricted cash was composed of million placed in escrow under a lease signed in for leasehold improvements for our new headquarters  as well as million of the purchase price placed in escrow in connection with our acquisition of strategic oxygen in december and which was fully released in the first quarter of investing activities in also included million for acquisitions of businesses and million for purchases of property and equipment 
we regularly invest excess funds in short and intermediate term interest bearing obligations of investment grade 
during  we used million of cash in financing activities as we paid a special cash dividend in december of million  which represented a payment of per share to our common stockholders 
we do not currently intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
also in  we used million for repurchases of our common stock and received from proceeds and related tax benefits from exercises of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
in the fourth quarter of  our board of directors increased our stock repurchase authorization by million 
as of december   we had remaining on our stock repurchase authorization and we plan to continue to repurchase our common stock during during  we used million to repurchase stock and received approximately million of proceeds from exercises of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
as of december   we held million million at par value of municipal bonds with an auction reset feature auction rate securities or ars 
in february  auctions began to fail for these securities and have continued to fail throughout as a result  our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or not exist 
based on our expected operating cash flows and our cash resources  we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on our ars investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and marketable investments of million 
we do not have a line of credit and do not presently anticipate the need to access a line of credit in the foreseeable future 
we plan to continue to introduce new products and services and expect to make the requisite investments in our infrastructure during the next months 
we believe that our current cash balance  marketable investments  and cash flows from operations will satisfy working capital  financing activities  and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next two years 
as of december   we had future contractual obligations as follows contractual obligations total thereafter in thousands operating leases other commitments total amount represents a commitment to construct approximately million of leasehold improvements under the terms of a build to suit lease

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we have historically not used derivative financial instruments 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and maintain liquidity while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable investments in a variety of securities  including us government agencies  municipal notes and bonds  corporate notes and bonds  commercial paper  and money market funds 
the securities  other than money market funds  are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets 
if interest rates rise  the market value of our investments may decline  which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity without giving effect to any future acquisitions or mergers 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
at december   we held approximately million million at par value of municipal notes with an auction reset feature auction rate securities or ars 
in february  auctions for these securities began to fail and continued to fail throughout these ars may not be accessible for in excess of twelve months because of continued failed auctions and have been classified in the consolidated balance sheets as long term marketable securities as of december  based on current market conditions  it is likely that auction failures will continue and as a result  our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or not exist 
if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
we valued the ars using a discounted cash flow model 
the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates of interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows  credit and liquidity premiums  and expected holding periods of the ars  based on data available at december  the assumptions used in valuing these ars are volatile and subject to change as the underlying sources of these assumptions and market conditions change  which could result in significant changes to the fair value of these ars 
the following table provides information about our investment portfolio 
for investment securities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by maturity date 
ars are shown based upon their contractual maturity dates between and principal amounts by maturity dates in us dollars dollars in thousands years ended december  thereafter state and municipal agency obligations federal agency and corporate obligations total investments weighted average interest rates foreign currency exchange 
on a global level  we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates as we enter into normal business transactions that may be in currencies other than the local currency of our subsidiaries 
in addition  transactions and account balances between our us and foreign subsidiaries expose us to currency exchange risk 
this exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
for the years ended december   and  we incurred foreign currency exchange losses of million  million and million  respectively 
historically  we have not entered into any hedging agreements 
however  we may enter into hedging agreements in the future to attempt to mitigate the financial effect of future fluctuations in the euro or other foreign currencies
