item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to historical consolidated financial information  the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions as described under the note regarding forward looking statements that appears earlier in this annual report on form k 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed under item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we design  develop  manufacture  sell and support precision  high performance advanced semiconductor wafer probe card products and solutions 
semiconductor manufacturers use our wafer probe cards to perform wafer sort and test on the semiconductor die  or chips  on the whole semiconductor wafer  which is prior to singulation of the wafer into individual separate chips 
we work closely with our customers on product design  as each wafer probe card is a custom product that is specific to the chip and wafer designs of the customer 
during wafer sort and test  a wafer probe card is mounted in a prober and connected to a semiconductor tester 
the wafer probe card is used as an interface to connect electrically with and test individual chips on a wafer 
our wafer probe cards are used by our customers in the front end of the semiconductor manufacturing process  as are our image sensor  parametric  or in line  probe cards 
we operate in a single industry segment and have derived substantially all of our revenues from the sale of wafer probe cards incorporating our proprietary technology  including our microspring interconnect technology 
during fiscal  we saw revenue growth over fiscal across all of our product markets 
our revenues increased by  or million  in fiscal as compared to fiscal this growth is attributed to a recovery in the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry  as well as faster than expected qualification of our new smartmatrix and touchmatrix product lines for the dram and flash markets which has resulted in the fastest volume ramp of a new product architecture in our history 
however  this revenue growth continues to be offset by extended qualification periods for the matrix product family at certain of our major customers  as well as lost business opportunities due to pricing pressures and quoted lead times 
during fiscal  we undertook a restructuring of our operations to simplify our overall structure and better align our operations with the current business environment  streamline our manufacturing structure and reduce both manufacturing cost and cycle times 
as part of this simplification  we reduced our workforce through these restructuring actions by approximately employees  or  during fiscal  shut down our korea back end manufacturing operations during the second quarter of fiscal  and ceased our transition of our manufacturing operations to singapore in the third quarter of fiscal we continue to perform our manufacturing operations in both livermore and japan 
we incurred net losses of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the net loss for fiscal is primarily due to lower gross margins on products sold  million of pre tax restructuring charges  and the impairment of certain long lived assets of million  offset by a million gain resulting from the release of a liability previously recorded as a secured borrowing due to the dismissal of our complaint against a customer 
the net loss for fiscal was primarily due to lower revenues  the recognition of a valuation allowance of million for our deferred tax assets  restructuring charges of million  million in a stock based compensation charge related to an option modification in connection with the retirement of our 
table of contents founder and former executive chairman of our board of directors in may  as well as million in provision for bad debts due to the heightened risk of non payment of certain accounts receivable 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately million as of december  as compared to million at december  the decrease in our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances was primarily due to the use of cash for operating activities in fiscal we believe that we will be able to satisfy our working capital requirements for the next twelve months with the liquidity provided by our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
if we are unsuccessful in improving our operating efficiency  reducing our cash outlays or increasing our available cash through financing  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will further decline in fiscal we believe the following information is important to understanding our business  our financial statements and the remainder of this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations fiscal year 
fiscal years ended december   december  and december  had weeks each 
our fiscal year ends on the last saturday in december 
revenues 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from product sales of wafer probe cards 
revenues from our customers are subject to fluctuations due to factors including  but not limited to  design cycles  technology adoption rates  competitive pressure to reduce prices  cyclicality of the different end markets into which our customers products are sold and market conditions in the semiconductor industry 
historically  increases in revenues have resulted from increased demand for our existing products  the introduction of new  more complex products and the penetration of new markets 
we expect that revenues from the sale of wafer probe cards will continue to account for substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of manufacturing materials  payroll  shipping and handling costs and  manufacturing related overhead 
our manufacturing operations rely upon a limited number of suppliers to provide key components and materials for our products  some of which are a sole source 
we order materials and supplies based on backlog and forecasted customer orders 
tooling and setup costs related to changing manufacturing lots at our suppliers are also included in the cost of revenues 
we expense all warranty costs and inventory provisions as cost of revenues 
we design  manufacture and sell custom advanced wafer probe cards into the semiconductor test market  which is subject to significant variability and demand fluctuations 
our wafer probe cards are complex products that are custom to a specific chip design of a customer and must be delivered on relatively short lead times as compared to our overall manufacturing process 
as our advanced wafer probe cards are manufactured in low volumes and must be delivered on relatively short lead times  it is not uncommon for us to acquire production materials and start certain production activities based on estimated production yields and forecasted demand prior to or in excess of actual demand for our wafer probe cards 
we record an adjustment to our inventory valuation for estimated obsolete and non saleable inventories based on assumptions about future demand  changes to manufacturing processes  and overall market conditions 
research and development 
research and development expenses include expenses related to product development  engineering and material costs 
almost all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we plan to continue to invest in research and development activities to improve and enhance existing product technologies and to develop new technologies for current and new products and for new applications 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales  marketing  and administrative personnel  provision for doubtful accounts  internal and 
table of contents outside sales representatives commissions  market research and consulting  and other sales  marketing  and administrative activities 
these expenses also include costs for protecting and enforcing our patent rights and regulatory compliance costs 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges include costs related to employee termination benefits  cost of long lived assets abandoned or impaired  as well as contract termination costs 
impairment of long lived assets 
asset impairment charges include charges associated with the write down of assets that have no future expected benefit or assets for which circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  as well as adjustments to the carrying amount of our assets held for sale 
use of estimates 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates may change as new information is obtained 
significant items that are subject to such estimates include the fair value of revenue elements  fair value of marketable securities  allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for product warranty  valuation of obsolete and slow moving inventory  valuation of our long lived assets  the assessment of recoverability of long lived assets  valuation and recognition of stock based compensation  provision for income taxes and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and tax liabilities and accruals for other liabilities 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period 
our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our financial condition and results of operations reported in our financial statements and related disclosures 
we have identified the following accounting policies as being critical because they require our management to make particularly difficult  subjective and or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and we base these estimates and assumptions on current facts  historical experiences and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially and adversely from our estimates 
our management has discussed the development  selection  application and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
in instances where final acceptance of our product is specified by our customer  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
we offer product maintenance and repair arrangements to our customers 
amounts due from our customers under these arrangements are initially recorded as deferred revenues 
the fees are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the service period and related costs are recorded as incurred 
in multiple element arrangements  we determine whether there is more than one unit of accounting 
when a sale involves multiple elements  such as products sold along with services  the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value 
table of contents and recognized when revenue recognition criteria for each element are met 
the amount of revenue recognized in a given period is affected by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and  if so  whether evidence of fair value exists 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and our ability to establish fair value for those elements could affect the timing of the revenue recognition 
revenues from the licensing of our design and manufacturing technology  which have not been material to date  are recognized over the term of the license agreement or when the significant contractual obligations have been fulfilled 
marketable securities our marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities of greater than days when purchased 
we generally classify our marketable securities at the date of acquisition as available for sale 
these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholder equity  net of tax 
any unrealized losses which are considered to be other than temporary impairments are recorded in other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
realized gains losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific identification method and recorded in other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
we measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value 
whenever possible  the fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets 
level valuations are obtained from real time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets 
level valuations are obtained from quoted market prices in active markets involving similar assets 
level valuations are based on unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology and include our own data about assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available under the circumstances 
each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value 
all of our available for sale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review 
we record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be other than temporary  or have other indicators of impairments 
if the fair value of an available for sale investment is less than its amortized cost basis  an other than temporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where we intend to sell the instrument  it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis  or a credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument 
if we intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the available for sale investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis  we recognize an other than temporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment amortized cost basis and its fair value 
restructuring charges restructuring charges include costs related to employee termination benefits  costs of long lived assets abandoned or impaired  as well as contract termination costs 
the determination of when we accrue for employee termination benefits and which standard applies depends on whether the termination benefits are provided under a one time benefit arrangement or under an on going benefit arrangement 
for restructuring charges recorded as an on going benefit arrangement  a liability for post employment benefits is recorded when payment is probable  the amount is reasonably estimable  and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated 
for restructuring charges recorded as a one time benefit arrangement  we recognize a liability for employee termination benefits when a plan of termination  approved by management and establishing the terms of the benefit arrangement  has been communicated to employees 
the timing of the recognition of one time employee termination benefits is dependent upon the period of time the employees are required to render service after communication 
if employees are not required to render service in order to receive the termination benefits or if employees will not be retained to render service beyond the minimum legal notification period  a liability for the termination benefits is 
table of contents recognized at the communication date 
in instances where employees will be retained to render service beyond the minimum legal notification period  the liability for employee termination benefits is measured initially at the communication date based on the fair value of the liability as of the termination date and is recognized ratably over the future service period 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
we record charges related to long lived assets to be abandoned when the assets cease to be used 
when we cease using a building or other asset with remaining non cancellable lease payments continuing past our use period  we record a liability for remaining payments under lease arrangements  as well as for contract termination costs  that will continue to be incurred under a contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to us at the cease use date 
given the significance of  and the timing of the execution of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made  including evaluating real estate market conditions for expected vacancy periods and sub lease rents 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of our restructuring plans  actual results may differ  thereby requiring us to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions 
warranty accrual we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
we continuously monitor product returns for warranty and maintain a reserve for the related expenses based upon our historical experience and any specifically identified field failures 
as we sell new products to our customers  we must exercise considerable judgment in estimating the expected failure rates 
this estimating process is based on historical experience of similar products  as well as various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
inventory valuation we state our inventories at the lower of cost principally standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
we review the adequacy of our inventory reserves on a quarterly basis and record adjustments to our inventory valuation for estimated obsolescence or non saleable inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventories and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
allowance for doubtful accounts a majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to large multinational semiconductor manufacturers throughout the world 
in order to monitor potential credit losses  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for probable credit losses based upon our assessment of the expected collectability of all accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis to assess the adequacy of the allowance 
we take into consideration any circumstances of which we are aware of a customer inability to meet its financial obligations  and our judgments as to prevailing economic conditions in the industry and their impact on our customers 
impairment of long lived assets we test long lived assets or asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
circumstances which could trigger a review include  but are not limited to significant decreases in the market price of the asset  significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors  accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset  current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset  and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life 

table of contents recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amounts of the asset and its fair value which is generally determined based on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset  as well as specific appraisals in certain instances 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including profit margins  long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rates and terminal growth rates 
in addition  significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of the fair value of our tangible long lived assets  including replacement cost  economic obsolescence  and the value that could be realized in orderly liquidation 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long lived assets  thereby requiring us to write down the assets 
accounting for income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes  under which deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
we estimate our provision for income taxes and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world 
estimates involve interpretations of regulations and are inherently complex 
resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year 
we are required to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis to determine whether there is a need for a valuation allowance with respect to such deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets  we consider available positive and negative evidence giving greater weight to our recent cumulative losses and our ability to carryback losses against prior taxable income and  commensurate with objective verifiability  the forecast of future taxable income including the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
we recognize and measure uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax provision 
accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet 
we file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world 
a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position  we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome 
we adjust these reserves  as well as the related interest  in light of changing facts and circumstances 
settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash 

table of contents stock based compensation under provisions of accounting standards  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected option life and forfeiture rates 
we develop our estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time 
a small change in the estimates used can result in a relatively large change in the estimated valuation 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards 
the most significant assumptions impacted by management judgment are the expected volatility and the expected life of the options 
the expected dividend yield and expected risk free interest rate are not as significant to the calculation of fair value 
in addition  adjustments to our estimates of the number of share based payment awards that we expect to vest did have a significant impact on the recorded share based compensation expense 
expected volatility the value of a stock option is derived from its potential for appreciation 
the more volatile the stock  the more valuable the option becomes because of the greater possibility of significant changes in stock price 
our computation of expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility of traded options to purchase shares of our common stock 
our decision to incorporate implied volatility was based on our assessment that implied volatility of publicly traded options in our common stock is expected to be more reflective of market conditions and  therefore  can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of our common stock alone 
expected life and forfeiture rate the expected life also has a significant effect on the value of the option 
the longer the term  the more time the option holder has to allow the stock price to increase without a cash investment and thus  the more valuable the option 
further  longer option terms provide more opportunity to exploit market highs 
however  employees are not required to wait until the end of the contractual term of a nontransferable option to exercise 
accordingly  we are required to estimate the expected term of the option 
we determine the expected life by considering several factors  including historical option exercise behavior  post vesting turnover rates and terms and vesting periods of the options granted 
similarly  we base our estimate of forfeiture on historical option cancellation behavior including pre vesting turnover rates 
out of period adjustment in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million adjustment to cost of revenues net of million income tax benefit  which resulted from an error in the calculation of capitalized manufacturing variances starting in the first quarter of fiscal through the second quarter of fiscal the error caused the understatement of cost of revenues and the overstatement of the overhead capitalized in inventory for most quarters 
the income tax benefit resulted from higher net losses in due to higher cost of revenue expenses 
we are able to carry back the increase in the loss to recover more prior year tax payments 
out of the total adjustment  a million adjustment to cost of revenues net of million income tax benefit was related to fiscal management and the audit committee believe that such amounts are not material to current and previously reported financial statements 
in fiscal and fiscal  we did not record any out of period adjustments

our revenues for the year ended december  were primarily generated by sales of wafer probe cards to manufacturers of dram devices 
revenues in fiscal increased significantly from fiscal primarily due to the industry ramp of ddr  the introduction of our smartmatrix products and the increased sales of higher priced products as a percentage of total dram sales  as well as the overall improvement in the semiconductor market in the current year 
revenues from sales to flash memory device manufacturers increased significantly in the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
the increase was partly driven by an million increase in the sale of nand flash wafer probe cards  resulting from further expansion of our nand market penetration via the recent qualification of touchmatrix at one of our largest customers 
nor flash also saw a substantial year over year increase of million driven by 
table of contents customer demand across our probe cards that service this market 
the increases were also partially the result of the overall improvement in the memory segment of the semiconductor market 
revenues from sales to soc device manufacturers increased in the year ended december  compared to the prior year  primarily due to the overall upturn in the semiconductor industry and market trends to more complex devices which positively impacted revenues from sales of our wafer probe cards 
revenue by geographic region the following table sets forth our revenues by geographic region for the periods indicated fiscal of revenues fiscal of revenues in thousands taiwan north america japan south korea asia pacific europe total revenues asia pacific includes all countries in the region except taiwan  south korea and japan  which are disclosed separately 
geographic revenue information is based on the location to which we ship the customer product 
for example  if a certain south korean customer purchases through their north american subsidiary and requests the products to be shipped to an address in asia pacific  this sale will be reflected in the revenue for asia pacific rather than north america 
the significant increase in taiwan  south korea  asia pacific and north america revenues for the year ended december  compared to the prior year was primarily due to the industry ramp up of ddr and the introduction of our smartmatrix and touchmatrix products 
the decrease in japan revenue for the year ended december  compared to the prior year was primarily due to the decrease in our dram product sales  caused by the lack of qualification of the smartmatrix product line due to extended qualification periods 
europe revenue remained flat in fiscal due to the consistent demand for all of our products in this region 
gross profit loss fiscal fiscal in thousands gross profit loss gross margin gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels  product mix  selling prices  factory loading  and material costs 
for the year ended december   gross margin declined compared to the prior year primarily due to a million increase in inventory provision charges  an out of period adjustment to cost of revenues of million that was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal  an increase of temporary personnel costs of million to support increased shipment volumes at various times during the year  and the expense for incentive bonuses of million 
this decline was partially mitigated by the favorable changes in product mix from lower margin to higher margin products  the 
table of contents increased selling prices of our products and the decreased depreciation expense resulting from the enterprise wide asset impairment and the multiple restructuring actions during fiscal inventory provision charges increased from million in fiscal  to million in fiscal the total inventory provision charge of million in fiscal was the result of lower customer demand for certain products  low production yields and minimum purchase order quantities 
excess custom inventories are not uncommon for us as our advanced wafer probe cards are custom designs manufactured in low volumes and must be delivered on relatively short lead times  which requires us to acquire production materials and start certain production activities based on estimated production yields and forecasted demand prior to or in excess of actual demand for our wafer probe cards 
in fiscal  the value of previously reserved materials that were used in manufacturing and shipped was million 
in the near future  our gross margins will likely continue to be adversely affected by lower levels of product revenues  even though we have taken significant steps to reduce our operating cost structure 
additionally  our gross margins may continue to be adversely affected if we are required to record additional inventory provision charges and inventory write downs if estimated average selling prices of products held in finished goods and work in process inventories are below the manufacturing cost of those products 
research and development fiscal fiscal in thousands research and development of revenues research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased million  or  compared to the prior year primarily due to the decrease in certain new technology product development related costs and the decrease in other costs as a result of our cost reduction efforts offset by the increase in personnel costs 
as a percent of revenues  research and development expenses decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the increased revenue base 
in the year ended december   costs related to new technology projects decreased by approximately million from fiscal as a result of our decision to terminate certain non strategic research and development activities in the second and third quarter of fiscal additionally  depreciation expense decreased by million year over year due to the lower carrying amount of our fixed assets resulting from impairments recorded in the second and third quarters of fiscal offsetting these decreases was a million increase in personnel costs primarily due to headcount increases as well as costs of employee incentive programs for which we did not record any charges in fiscal stock based compensation included within research and development expenses was million for the year ended december  compared to million for fiscal  with the increase being primarily due to the increase in employee stock awards 
we are continuing our strategic investments in research and development  including investments in the development of our next generation parallelism architecture and products  fine pitch  advanced microspring interconnect technology and new process technologies 
we remain committed to product development in new and emerging technologies

as a percent of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal as compared to the prior year  primarily due to the increased revenue base along with the reduction in expenses resulting from our on going cost reduction efforts 
the million decrease in fiscal compared with the prior year was composed of a million decrease in bad debt expense due to a reduction in additional bad debt as compared to  as well as benefits from collections on amounts previously reserved as bad debts  a million decrease in stock based compensation expenses related to fewer awards being granted in fiscal  a million decrease in salary and wages due to the headcount decrease in fiscal  and a million decrease in legal and outside service fees due to a reduction in litigation activity as well as our cost reduction efforts  offset by a million increase for incentive bonuses and a million increase in severance costs related to the departure of certain executives in fiscal restructuring charges fiscal fiscal in thousands restructuring charges of revenues restructuring charges increased million  or  from fiscal to fiscal the increase was primarily due to the number of actions that were taken in along with an million impairment of property and equipment included in the restructuring charges of fiscal compared with the million impairment included in the restructuring charges of fiscal the restructuring plans we implemented in fiscal and fiscal are discussed below 
in fiscal  we implemented two restructuring plans that included primarily reductions in our global workforce in an effort to lower our quarterly operating expense run rate  which extended the cost reduction plans implemented during fiscal q restructuring plan in the first quarter of fiscal  we implemented a restructuring plan the q restructuring plan intended to align resources in continuation of our global regionalization strategy to place more decision making in regions close to our semiconductor customers 
as part of this regionalization strategy  we initiated the moving of certain assembly and test operations from our back end manufacturing processes in livermore  california to asia  and planned to bring up and qualify our back end manufacturing operations in singapore 
as a result of this restructuring plan  our worldwide headcount was expected to be reduced by full time employees 
the activities comprising this reduction in force were expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal we recorded million in charges for the q restructuring plan in fiscal  which was all related to severance and related benefits 

table of contents q restructuring plan in the second quarter of fiscal  we announced a series of corporate initiatives  including a reduction in workforce  which represented a renewed focus on streamlining and simplifying our operations as well as reducing our quarterly operating costs the q restructuring plan 
these actions included reducing the scope of the previously contemplated manufacturing operations in korea  resulting in a reduction of workforce of employees related to the assembly and test function  and undertaking a plan to rescind the previously issued severance arrangements for certain employees impacted by the q restructuring plan 
as a result of this rescission plan  as of june   we had reversed the existing accrual for the severance costs booked in conjunction with the q restructuring plan  of million  including the accrued retention bonus to date 
as of september   we completed this rescission plan 
additionally  the reduction in workforce impacted employees spread across all functions of the organization to further streamline and simplify our operations and reduce operating costs 
the activities comprising this reduction in force were substantially completed by the end of fiscal as a result of the q restructuring plan  we have realized and expect to realize quarterly savings in fiscal and the future years of approximately million  excluding stock based compensation expenses  starting from the second quarter for fiscal we recorded million in charges for severance and related benefits  and million for property and equipment impairments for the q restructuring plan in fiscal  respectively 
the impairment charges were related to the impairment of certain equipment and software assets related to our assembly and test operations in korea that would no longer be utilized 
q restructuring plan in the third quarter of fiscal  we announced a restructuring plan the q restructuring plan to cease the transition of manufacturing operations to singapore 
this decision resulted in a reduction in force of employees primarily at our singapore facility 
the manufacturing activities that were scheduled to be transitioned to singapore will remain in livermore  and livermore will continue as the primary manufacturing operating location for the company 
the company expects that the activities comprising this reduction in force will be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal in addition  we ceased the utilization of a portion of the facility in singapore that was expected to be utilized for our manufacturing operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal as an additional restructuring action in connection with our q restructuring plan 
as a result of the q restructuring plan  we have realized quarterly savings  excluding stock based compensation expenses  of approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal and we expect to realize quarterly savings of million in the quarters commencing in fiscal in fiscal  we recorded million for the q restructuring plan for severance and related benefits  million impairment charges for certain equipment and leasehold improvements in singapore that would no longer be utilized and million in charges for the remaining lease obligations that will continue to be incurred under operating lease contracts of the singapore facilities 
in addition  due to the combined effect of the significant change in our business strategy in connection with the q restructuring plan  recurring operating losses and the sustained decline in the company stock price  we reviewed the recoverability of our long lived assets in the third quarter of fiscal  as discussed in note impairment of long lived assets of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
q restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we implemented a restructuring plan the q restructuring plan including reducing our global workforce by employees across the organization 

table of contents we recorded million in charges for severance and related benefits in fiscal we expect that the activities comprising this reduction in force will be substantially completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal as a result of the q restructuring plan  we expect to realize quarterly savings of approximately million  excluding stock based compensation expenses  starting from the first quarter of fiscal the liabilities we have accrued for the restructuring plans discussed above represent our best estimate of the obligations we expect to incur and could be subject to adjustment as market conditions change 
the cash payments associated with our various reductions in force are expected to be substantially paid by the end of the first quarter of fiscal impairment of long lived assets fiscal fiscal in thousands impairment of long lived assets of revenues impairment charges increased million from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to the enterprise wide asset impairment recorded in the third quarter of fiscal in the third quarter of fiscal  we reviewed the recoverability of our long lived assets due to a significant change in our business strategy in connection with the q restructuring plan  recurring operating losses and net cash outflows from operations and the sustained decline in the company stock price 
as a result of this review  we concluded that our business was not able to fully recover the carrying amounts of our assets 
accordingly  we reviewed the carrying amounts at september  of all of our long lived assets for impairment 
based on this analysis  an impairment charge of approximately million was recorded as of september  this charge was comprised of million for leasehold improvements  million impairment for manufacturing equipment  million impairment for computer equipment and software  million for construction in progress and million for purchased intangible assets 
in addition  we recorded impairment charges totaling million in fiscal as follows million impairment related to certain construction in progress projects for the development and build of manufacturing equipment  including additional related equipment that was in service  that was identified as excess capacity  million impairment of certain purchased intangible assets related to precision motion control automation that were acquired in conjunction with our acquisition of certain assets from electroglas  inc in out of bankruptcy proceedings  million related to certain leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures that will be abandoned as a result of the consolidation of office space in livermore  and million write down of a building held for sale to its estimated fair value 
in fiscal  we recorded total impairments of million related to certain equipment that was determined to be held for sale  as well as for the termination of certain on going projects 
these impairment charges were originally recorded through cost of revenues in the consolidated statement of operations in our form k for fiscal however this amount has been reclassified to impairment of long lived assets in the consolidated statement of operations in this form k for fiscal to conform with the current year presentation of asset impairments 

table of contents management believes it is reasonably possible that additional impairment charges that would reduce further the carrying amounts of the company property and equipment and intangible assets may arise in fiscal if the company is unable to achieve operating results anticipated by the company financial plan

the change in other income expense  net for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the million gain recorded in the third quarter of fiscal which resulted from the release of the liability previously recorded as a secured borrowing due to the dismissal of our complaint against a customer 
provision for benefit from income taxes fiscal fiscal in thousands provision for benefit from income taxes effective tax rate the provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory us federal rate principally due to a valuation allowance recorded against us and certain non us deferred tax assets 
the remaining tax provision for fiscal was primarily comprised of tax expense for non us cost plus entities offset by a tax benefit related to settlement of a non us tax audit 
in fiscal we recorded a valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets 
the fiscal tax provision was offset by a benefit related to our ability to generate tax refunds through federal net operating loss carry back 
we anticipate that we will continue to record a valuation allowance against our us and certain non us deferred tax assets 
we expect our future tax provisions  during the time such valuation allowances are recorded  will consist primarily of the tax provision of our profitable non us jurisdictions 
at december   we had federal  state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards expire in  the state net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates from through  and the foreign net operating loss carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely 

table of contents from time to time  we engage in certain intercompany transactions and legal entity restructurings 
we consider many factors when evaluating these transactions  including the alignment of our corporate structure with our organizational objectives  the operational and tax efficiency of our corporate structure  as well as the long term cash flows and cash needs of our different businesses 
these transactions may impact our overall tax rate and or result in additional cash tax payments 
the impact in any period may be significant 
these transactions may be complex in nature and the impact of such transactions on future periods may be difficult to estimate 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a legal entity restructuring to align our corporate structure with our organizational objectives 
the restructuring activities did not significantly impact the tax provision due to valuation allowances recorded against us and singapore deferred tax assets 
fiscal years ended december  and december  revenues change fiscal of revenues fiscal of revenues in thousands revenues by market dram flash soc total revenues the decrease in revenue for the year ended december  was primarily due to weak demand for our advanced wafer probe cards caused by the slow recovery in the semiconductor market 
for certain of our products we also experienced pricing pressure due to the availability of competitive products  which also contributed to the decrease in revenues 
our revenues for the year ended december  were primarily generated by sales of wafer probe cards to manufacturers of dram devices 
revenues for our products that address the dram segment declined in the year ended december  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a number of factors including the relative supply and demand of various semiconductor devices and end products incorporating those devices  semiconductor manufacturers efforts to curtail spending and conserve cash by taking capacity offline  reducing production  delaying the transition to new technology nodes and postponing the implementation of tooling cycles 
we also experienced pricing pressure on certain dram test product due to the competitive environment 
revenues from sales to flash memory device manufacturers also decreased significantly in the year ended december  compared to fiscal  with the decrease driven by sales declines in both nor and nand flash wafer probe cards 
the weakness in nor flash can be attributed to a decline in purchases by certain key customers  specifically from our largest nor customer filing for bankruptcy protection in the first quarter of fiscal additionally  revenues from nand flash wafer probe cards declined as nand flash memory device manufacturers significantly reduced their output in the first quarter of fiscal  in an attempt to promote industry absorption of excess inventories 
revenues from manufacturers of soc devices decreased in the year ended december  compared to fiscal  primarily due to the overall downturn in the semiconductor industry which negatively impacted the revenues from sales of our wafer probe cards 

table of contents revenue by geographic region the following table sets forth our revenues by geographic region for the periods indicated fiscal of revenues fiscal of revenues in thousands taiwan japan north america asia pacific europe total revenues asia pacific includes all countries in the region except taiwan and japan  which are disclosed separately 
geographic revenue information is based on the location to which we ship the customer product 
for example  if a certain south korean customer purchases through their north american subsidiary and requests the products to be shipped to an address in asia pacific  this sale will be reflected in the revenue for asia pacific rather than north america 
the decrease in revenues across all geographic regions was generally due to the semiconductor industry downturn  characterized by weak demand for semiconductor devices  delayed production ramps and weak device pricing environments 
the decrease in revenues across all geographic regions for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to the decrease in sales in those regions in each of the product markets we address dram  flash and soc 
additionally  revenues decreased due generally to the semiconductor industry downturn  characterized by weak demand for semiconductor devices  delayed production ramps and weak device pricing environments 
gross profit fiscal fiscal in thousands gross profit gross margin gross margin fluctuates with revenue levels  product mix  selling prices  factory loading  and material costs 
for fiscal  gross margin declined compared to fiscal  primarily due to the significant decline in revenue driving lower factory utilization  thereby increasing unit manufacturing costs  combined with declines in average selling prices as well as an unfavorable change in product mix from higher margin to lower margin products 
this decline was partially mitigated by lower personnel costs as a result of our fiscal and global cost reduction plans as well as a decline in inventory write downs 
inventory charge offs decreased from million or of revenues in fiscal to million  or of revenues  in fiscal the higher inventory write downs in fiscal were associated with deterioration in the dram memory segment in that period 
inventory write downs declined in fiscal despite the continued deterioration in the dram memory segment primarily due to stronger inventory management in fiscal excess custom inventories are not uncommon for us as our advanced wafer probe cards are custom designs manufactured in low volumes and must be delivered on relatively short lead times  which requires us to acquire production materials and start certain production activities based on estimated production yields and forecasted demand prior to or in excess of actual demand for our wafer probe cards

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our significant commitments to make future payments in cash under contractual obligations as of december  payments due in fiscal years after total in thousands operating leases other purchase obligations total other purchase obligations are primarily for purchases of inventory and manufacturing related service contracts 
for the purposes of this table  other purchase obligations are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on information available to us as of december  timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
the table above excludes our gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits  which totaled approximately million as of december  and are classified in deferred taxes and other long term tax liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
the timing of any payments which could result from these unrecognized tax benefits will depend upon a number of factors 
accordingly  the timing of payment cannot be estimated and has been excluded from the table above 
as of december   the changes to our uncertain tax positions in the next months  that are reasonable possible  are not expected to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements historically  we have not participated in transactions that have generated relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we were not involved in any such off balance sheet arrangements 
indemnification agreements we may  from time to time in the ordinary course of our business enter into contractual arrangements with third parties that include indemnification obligations 
under these contractual arrangements  we have agreed to defend  indemnify and or hold the third party harmless from and against certain liabilities 
these arrangements include indemnities in favor of customers in the event that our wafer probe cards infringe a third party intellectual property and our lessors in connection with facility leasehold liabilities that we may cause 
in addition  we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain of our officers  and our bylaws contain indemnification obligations in favor of our directors  officers and agents 
these indemnity arrangements may limit the type of the claim  the total amount that we can be required to pay in connection with the indemnification obligation and the time within which an indemnification claim can be made 
the duration of the indemnification obligation may vary  and for most arrangements  survives the agreement term and is indefinite 
we believe that substantially all of our indemnity arrangements provide either for limitations on the maximum potential future payments we could be obligated to make  or for 
table of contents limitations on the types of claims and damages we could be obligated to indemnify  or for both 
however  it is not possible to determine or reasonably estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification obligations due to the varying terms of such obligations  the history of prior indemnification claims  the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular contractual arrangement and in each potential future claim for indemnification  and the contingency of any potential liabilities upon the occurrence of events that are not reasonably determinable 
we have not had any requests for indemnification under these arrangements 
our management believes that any liability for these indemnity arrangements would not be material to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we have not recorded any liabilities for these indemnification arrangements on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  recent accounting pronouncements please refer to the discussion of our recent accounting pronouncements in note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements under part ii  item in this form k 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
we conduct certain operations in foreign currencies 
we enter into currency forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion  but not all  of existing foreign currency denominated amounts 
gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in income 
because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on the currency forward exchange contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged  these financial instruments are not expected to subject us to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we recognized a net loss of million and a net gain of million for the fiscal years ended december  and december   respectively  from the fluctuation in foreign exchange rates and the valuation of these hedge contracts in our financial statements under other expense 
interest rate sensitivity 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we invest in a number of securities including us agency discount notes  money market funds and commercial paper 
we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in high grade investment securities 
by policy  we limit the amount of credit exposure to an issuer  except us treasuries and us agencies 
we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage interest rate exposures nor do we invest for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair market value of our fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by increases in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates 
a hypothetical basis point one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates compared to rates at december  and december  would have affected the fair value of our investment portfolio by less than million and million  respectively
