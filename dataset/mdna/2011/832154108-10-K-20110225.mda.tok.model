this statement requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
measurement of the deferred items is based on enacted tax laws 
in the event the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of the company s assets and liabilities result in a deferred tax asset  we are required to evaluate the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such asset 
a valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized 
based on our evaluation  we believe all of the deferred tax assets at december  are likely to be realized 
in july  the fasb clarified the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements 
a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation process  based on the technical merits

the duration of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees varies  and in certain cases  may be indefinite 
the majority of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees may not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential for future payments we could be obligated to make 
we have not recorded any liability for these indemnities  commitments and guarantees in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents real property leases our corporate headquarters  including our principal administrative  sales and marketing  customer support and research and development facility  is located in aliso viejo  california  where we currently lease and occupy approximately  square feet of space pursuant to leases that expire on may  and january  we lease approximately  square feet in pittsburgh  pennsylvania under a lease that expires december  we lease approximately  square feet in mountain view  california under a lease that expires february  we lease approximately  square feet in chicago  illinois under a lease that expires august  we lease approximately  square feet in watsonville  california under a lease that expires september  we lease approximately  square feet in herndon  virginia under a lease that expires may  we lease approximately  square feet in austin  texas under a lease that expires june  internationally  we lease space in stockholm  sweden  belgrade  serbia  oslo  norway  and vancouver  canada

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of results of operations  financial condition and liquidity are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an on going basis  we review our estimates to ensure that the estimates appropriately reflect changes in our business or new information as it becomes available 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we currently report our net revenues under two operating groups wireless and productivity graphics 
within each of these groups software revenue is recognized based on the customer and contract type 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is probable as required by fasb asc topic no 
 software revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues from sales of our software to oem customers or end users as completed products are shipped and titles passes  or from royalties generated as authorized customers duplicate our software  if the other requirements are met 
if the requirements are not met at the date of shipment  revenue is not recognized until these elements are known or resolved 
returns from oem customers are limited to defective goods or goods shipped in error 
historically  oem customer returns have not exceeded the very nominal estimates and reserves 
for productivity graphics sales  management reviews available retail channel information and makes a determination of a return provision for sales made to distributors and retailers based on current channel inventory levels and historical return patterns 
certain sales to distributors or retailers are made on a consignment basis 
revenue for consignment sales are not recognized until sell through to the final customer is established 
within the productivity graphics group certain revenues are booked net of revenue sharing payments 
we have a few multiple 
table of contents element agreements for which we have contracted to provide a perpetual license for use of proprietary software  to provide non recurring engineering  and in some cases to provide software maintenance post contract support 
for multiple element agreements  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for all contract elements is reviewed and the timing of the individual element revenue streams is determined and recognized as required 
sales directly to end users are recognized upon shipment 
end users have a thirty day right of return  but such returns are reasonably estimable and have historically been immaterial 
we also provide technical support to our customers 
such costs have historically been insignificant 
sales incentives for our productivity graphics sales  the cost of sales incentives the company offers without charge to customers that can be used in  or that are exercisable by a customer as a result of  a single exchange transaction is accounted for as a reduction of revenue as required by fasb asc topic no 
 software revenue recognition 
we use historical redemption rates to estimate the cost of customer incentives 
total sales incentives were million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we sell our products worldwide 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history  the customer s current credit worthiness and various other factors  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
we estimate credit losses and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts reserve based upon these estimates 
while such credit losses have historically been within our estimated reserves  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if not  this could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
internal software development costs development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
the company considers technological feasibility to be established when all planning  designing  coding and testing has been completed according to design specifications 
after technological feasibility is established  any additional costs are capitalized 
through december   software has been substantially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility  accordingly  no costs have been capitalized to date 
in process research and development in  we capitalized million of ipr d costs related to our acquisition of core mobility in accordance with accounting standards that became effective in this ipr d project was completed during the fourth quarter of as such  amortization has commenced and will continue over its estimated useful life 
the fair value of the ipr d was determined using the discounted cash flow approach 
the expected future cash flows were estimated and discounted to their net present values at an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return 
significant factors considered in the calculation of the rate of return were the weighted average cost of capital and return on assets  as well as the risks inherent in the development process  including the likelihood of achieving technological success and market acceptance 
future cash flows were estimated based on forecasted revenue and costs  taking into account the expected product life cycle  market penetration and growth rates 

table of contents capitalized software and amortization we capitalize internally developed software and software purchased from third parties if the related software product under development has reached technological feasibility or if there are alternative future uses for the purchased software as required by fasb asc topic no 
 software costs of software to be sold  leased  or marketed 
these costs are amortized on a product by product basis  typically over an estimated life of five to seven years  using the larger of the amount calculated using the straight line method or the amount calculated using the ratio between current period gross revenues and the total of current period gross revenues and estimated future gross revenues 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate on a product by product basis the unamortized capitalized cost of computer software compared to the net realizable value of that product 
the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs of a computer software product exceed its net realizable value is written off 
intangible assets and amortization amortization expense related to other intangibles acquired in previous acquisitions is calculated on a straight line basis over various useful lives 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets long lived assets to be held are reviewed for events or changes in circumstances which indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
they are tested for recoverability using undiscounted cash flows to determine whether or not impairment to such value has occurred as required by fasb asc topic no

the company has determined that there was no impairment at december  valuation of goodwill and intangible assets the company accounts for goodwill and intangible assets as required by fasb asc topic no 
 intangibles goodwill and other 
this statement requires us to periodically assess the impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets  which requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets 
these assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that their carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances a determination that the carrying value of such assets cannot be recovered through undiscounted cash flows  loss of legal ownership or title to the assets  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets  or the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends 
if the intangible assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the intangible assets exceeds the fair value of the intangible assets 
in addition  we base the useful lives and the related amortization expense on our estimate of the useful life of the intangible assets 
due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the carrying value of our intangible assets and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to uncertainty  and as additional information becomes known  we may change our estimate  in which case  the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase 
the company has not recognized any impairment loss through december  in accordance with fasb asc topic no 
 intangibles goodwill and other  we review the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
our annual impairment testing date is december 
table of contents recoverability of goodwill is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value of the underlying net assets in the reporting units 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than the fair value of its net assets  goodwill is deemed impaired and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the difference between the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of its other assets and liabilities 
we determined that we did not have any impairment of goodwill at december   or estimates of reporting unit fair value are based upon market capitalization and therefore are volatile being sensitive to market fluctuations 
to the extent that our market capitalization decreases significantly or the allocation of value to our reporting units change  we could be required to write off some or all of our goodwill

a valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company s net deferred tax assets were not reduced by a tax valuation allowance at december  management evaluated the positive and negative evidence in determining the realizability of the net deferred tax assets at december  and concluded it is more likely than not that the company should realize its net deferred tax assets through future operating results and the reversal of taxable temporary differences 
in july  the fasb clarified the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements 
a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation process  based on the technical merits

at december   the carrying values of our financial instruments approximated fair values based on current market prices and rates 
foreign currency risk while a majority of our business is denominated in us dollars  we do occasionally invoice in foreign currencies 
for the three years ended december   and  our revenues denominated in foreign currencies were million  million  and million  respectively 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and certain other currencies may affect our results of operations and period to period comparisons of our operating results 
we do not currently engage in hedging or similar transactions to reduce these risks 
the operational expenses of our foreign entities reduce the currency exposure we have because our foreign currency revenues are offset in part by expenses payable in foreign currencies 
as such  we do not believe we have a material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations at this time
