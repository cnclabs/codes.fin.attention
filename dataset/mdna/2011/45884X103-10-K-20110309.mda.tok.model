table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview for a concise overview of information relating to our business  including actimmune and our product development programs  please see the discussion in item business overview 
pirfenidone esbriet pirfenidone is an orally active  small molecule compound under development for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
in march  pirfenidone was granted marketing authorization for commercial use in the european union for the treatment of mild to moderate ipf following the adoption of a positive opinion by the chmp of the ema 
we are currently evaluating our clinical development options to gain approval of pirfenidone for commercial use within the united states and have plans to begin a new phase clinical study in the first half of pirfenidone may also prove effective in multiple fibrotic indications including hermansky pudlak syndrome  a fatal  fibrotic lung disease believed to be caused by genetic factors 
in vitro experiments show that pirfenidone inhibits collagen synthesis  down regulates profibrotic and proinflammatory cytokines and decreases fibroblast proliferation and stimulation in response to cytokines 
to support our anticipated commercialization efforts of esbriet in europe  we are currently investing in the establishment of a commercial infrastructure within the european union  including an increase to our employee headcount in that region 
on december   we announced several additions to our senior leadership team in support of our commercialization efforts as well as announcing the establishment of our european headquarters in reinach  switzerland 
in december  we transferred all of our non us rights to research  develop and commercialize pirfenidone for ipf to our wholly owned swiss subsidiary  intermune international ag 
based on our current intellectual property portfolio  we expect to have exclusive rights to sell pirfenidone within the european union through sale of danoprevir rights to roche in october  we entered into a collaboration agreement with roche  subsequently amended  to develop and commercialize products from our hcv protease inhibitor program  including danoprevir 
pursuant to our collaboration with roche  we had successfully progressed the danoprevir compound from pre clinical testing into phase b clinical development with generally positive clinical results 
in october  we sold our worldwide development and commercialization rights in danoprevir to roche for million in cash 
in connection with this transaction  the collaboration agreement that we and roche entered into in october was terminated 
roche has agreed to reimburse us for royalty and milestone obligations that we continue to have to novartis corporation and array related to danoprevir 
significant license acquisition agreements we are highly dependent on technology that we have licensed or acquired from third parties 
actimmune  which is currently our only marketed product  is subject to a license agreement with genentech  inc the majority of our clinical development pipeline is also based on technology that we have licensed from third parties 
details of these agreements can be found elsewhere in this report under item business license  collaboration and other agreements  notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and under the heading results of operations below 
we paid million in march in connection with our decision to proceed with regulatory approval for pirfenidone and an additional million in connection with our clinical progress of danoprevir 
we may be required to make future contingent milestone payments to the owners of our licensed products or the suppliers of our drug compounds in accordance with our license  commercialization and collaboration agreements in the aggregate amount of million if all of the remaining milestones per the agreements are achieved 
these milestones include development  regulatory approval  commercialization and sales milestones 
of the remaining million in aggregate milestone payments  million in contingent payments would be made by us only if positive phase data and product approval in the united states is achieved for pirfenidone 
an additional million is due march upon our receipt of the approval of pirfenidone by the european union 
potential future milestone payments of million are related to the further development of actimmune  for which we have no current plans  and therefore we do not expect to pay these amounts 
included in the million in future aggregate milestone payments are aggregate milestone payments of million payable to array and novartis  of which roche has agreed to reimburse us in connection with our sale of danoprevir to roche 

table of contents issuance of convertible debt in february  we issued convertible senior notes due march  the notes in an aggregate principal amount of million 
as of march   the holders of all of our then outstanding notes  approximately million in aggregate principal  elected to convert the outstanding notes into an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
as a result  there are no notes that remain outstanding and we have no further obligations under the indenture governing the notes 
on june   we issued million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due the notes to certain holders of our then outstanding notes in exchange for million in aggregate principal amount of their notes 
the notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior debt and rank senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future subordinated debt 
the notes were exchanged by us with the holders exclusively and solely for the notes in a transaction exempt from registration under section a of the securities act of  as amended 
the notes mature on march  and bear interest at a rate of per annum 
the holders of the notes may convert their notes into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes representing a conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment 
the conversion rate for the notes will be increased in certain circumstances that constitute a fundamental change of the company and in connection with a withholding tax redemption 
we can only settle conversion of the notes by delivery of shares of common stock 
in april  we entered into exchange agreements with certain holders of our convertible notes to issue  in the aggregate  approximately million shares of common stock  valued at approximately million  in exchange for  in the aggregate  million principal amount of the convertible notes  representing approximately of the aggregate principal outstanding of our notes at the date of the exchanges 
in september  we entered into an exchange agreement with certain holders of our convertible notes to issue approximately million shares of common stock  valued at approximately million  in exchange for approximately million principal amount of the convertible notes  representing approximately of the aggregate principal outstanding of our notes at the date of the exchange 
additionally  in september  we entered into exchange agreements with certain holders of our convertible notes to issue approximately million shares of common stock  valued at approximately million  in exchange for approximately million principal amount of the convertible notes  representing approximately of the aggregate principal outstanding of our notes at the date of the agreements 
all of the convertible notes we acquired pursuant to the exchange agreements in september were retired upon the closing of the exchanges in october upon completion of ten trading days of our common stock necessary to determine the final number of shares to be issued 
all of the convertible notes we acquired pursuant to the exchange agreements in april and september were retired upon the closing of the debt exchanges 
need for additional capital we commenced operations in and have incurred significant losses to date 
our revenue has been limited primarily to sales of actimmune  which has been declining in recent years 
we expect to continue to incur net losses in the near term as we continue our preparations for the commercial launch of pirfenidone in the european union  including expanding our commercial infrastructure and related employee headcount  continue the development of pirfenidone for approval in the united states  including the launch of a new phase clinical study in the first half of  continue our research in the area of hepatology  and continue to grow our operational capabilities 
although we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  together with anticipated cash flows from sales of actimmune will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  debt obligations and capital requirements under our current business plan through at least the next months  we may continue to require substantial additional funding in the future to realize the full commercial potential of our approved products and to complete our currently contemplated research and development activities 
as a result  we may attempt to raise additional funds through equity and or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources 
if additional capital is not available to us or is not available to us on terms 
table of contents that are favorable  we may be forced to curtail our research and development activities  our commercialization activities  or we may be required to cease our operations entirely 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
these estimates are the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities  which in turn may impact our reported revenue and expenses 
we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially change the financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
convertible debt on january   we adopted financial accounting standards board  accounting standards codification asc topic asc 
asc requires the issuer of convertible debt that may be settled in shares or cash upon conversion at their option  such as our million convertible senior notes due march that were outstanding as of december   to account for their liability and equity components separately by bifurcating the conversion option from the debt instrument  classifying the conversion option in equity and then accreting the resulting discount on the debt as additional interest expense over the expected life of the debt 
the value assigned to the debt component is the estimated fair value  as of the issuance date  of similar debt without the conversion feature 
this required management to make estimates and assumptions regarding interest rates as of the date of original issuance  in addition to estimates and assumptions regarding interest rates as of our june debt extinguishment and the debt exchanges 
stock based compensation beginning january   we account for stock based compensation in accordance with asc topic under the fair value recognition provisions  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
in order to estimate the value of share based awards  we use the black scholes model  which requires the use of certain subjective assumptions 
the most significant assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility and the expected term of the award 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from any of these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
if all of the remaining and outstanding restricted stock awards that were granted in the past four years beginning in became vested  we would recognize approximately million in compensation expense over a weighted average remaining period of year 
if all of the remaining nonvested and outstanding stock option awards that have been granted became vested  we would recognize approximately million in compensation expense over a weighted average remaining period of years 
however  no compensation expense will be recognized for any stock awards that do not vest 
revenue recognition and revenue reserves revenue on product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed  and final delivery has occurred and there is a reasonable assurance of collectibility of the amounts receivable from the customer 
therefore  revenue is generally recognized upon delivery when title passes to a credit worthy customer 
reserves are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for estimated returns  rebates  chargebacks and cash discounts  if applicable 
we sell to a limited number of customers  mainly specialty pharmacies and distributors 
we obtain written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price 
we are obligated to accept returns from customers if the pharmaceuticals they purchased have reached their expiration date 
we have demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of product returns based on 
table of contents historical experience 
due to the nature of our business model and based on historical experience  these estimates are not highly subjective 
we review all sales transactions for potential rebates  chargebacks and discounts each month and monitor product ordering cycles and actual returns  product expiration dates and wholesale inventory levels to estimate potential product return rates 
we believe that our reserves are adequate 
for each of the periods presented below  we have not made any shipments as a result of incentives and or in excess of our customers ordinary course of business inventory levels 
specialty wholesalers maintain low inventory levels and manage their inventory levels to optimize patient based need demand and generally do not overstock actimmune 
the tables below present the amounts reported as revenue reductions for the periods indicated in thousands  except percentages year ended december  reductions to revenue cash discounts product returns chargebacks medicaid rebates total year ended december  gross product revenue revenue reductions as a of gross product revenue cash discounts product returns chargebacks medicaid rebates total in  chargebacks were approximately of gross revenue  but historically have fallen within a range of to in any given year depending on the customer base 
the increase in the past two years above this range is primarily attributed to the tricare pharmacy program tricare which became effective january and is administered by the department of defense 
excluding tricare  chargebacks would have been approximately in  which would have increased reported revenue by approximately million 
in  medicaid rebates were approximately of gross revenue  and historically have fallen within a range of to in any given year 
if medicaid rebates had decreased to during  this would have increased our reported revenue by approximately million 
the ranges noted above are based on a review of historical trends  though we believe the trend for the ranges in future periods will be modestly higher given the recent price increases described below 
chargebacks as a percentage of gross revenue have increased year over year for the past two years due to disappointing clinical trial results and our subsequent decision to discontinue further development of actimmune in addition to the new tricare program 
the increase in medicaid rebate revenue reductions from in and in to in is due to price increases for actimmune implemented midway through and and the lack of a corresponding increase in the medicaid reimbursement rate 
the source of information that we monitor in assisting us with computing chargebacks is from the federal supply schedule  veterans administration and public health system pricing documents 
these documents establish the maximum price allowable for the sale of our product to a government customer 
the chargeback amount per unit is computed as the difference between our sales price to the wholesaler and the selling price from the wholesaler to a government customer 
chargebacks are processed directly by the wholesalers and are deducted from payments to us 
the source of information that we monitor in assisting us with computing medicaid rebates is from each of the states 
medicaid rebates are billed directly to us from each state 
billings from the states  which are based on end user reports submitted by pharmacies to the state agencies  are typically received within days after the end of each calendar quarter 
we use historical billing and payment trends to assist us in determining an estimated medicaid rebate amount each period 

table of contents clinical trial accruals we accrue costs for clinical trial activities performed by contract research organizations based upon the estimated amount of work completed on each study 
these estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and related activities 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence with contract research organizations and review of contractual terms 
however  if we have incomplete or inaccurate information  we may overestimate or underestimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time 
in the event we underestimate  we could be required to record significant additional research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known 
all such costs are charged to research and development expenses as incurred 
to date  we have not experienced changes in estimates that have led to material research and development expense adjustments being recorded in subsequent periods 
inventory reserves our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and our inventory costs are determined using the specific identification method which approximates first in first out 
we enter into purchase obligations to purchase our inventory based upon sales forecasts to enable us to mitigate some of the risk associated with the long lead times required to manufacture our products 
we write off the cost of inventory and reserve for future minimum purchase commitments  if any  that we consider to be in excess of forecasted future demand 
we define excess inventory as inventory that will expire before it can be sold  based on future sales forecasts 
in making these assessments  we are required to make judgments as to the future demand for current or committed inventory purchase levels 
we are also required to monitor the expiration dates of our products  since our products can no longer be used after their respective expiration dates 
actimmune has an expiration date of months from the date of manufacture 
as part of our on going excess inventory assessment for actimmune  we also estimate the expiration date of any actimmune to be manufactured in the future 
projected revenue trends resulted in us recording charges during  and of million  million  and million  respectively  to cost of goods sold for excess inventories 
if actimmune revenue levels experienced in future periods are substantially below our current expectations  we could be required to record additional charges for excess inventories 
please refer to the statements under item a 
risk factors in this report to gain a better understanding of the possible reasons why actual results may differ from our estimates 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and revenue for the year ended december   we recorded total net revenue of million  compared to million and million for the same periods in and  respectively 
the substantial increase in revenue in as compared to is primarily due to the sale of our worldwide rights in danoprevir to roche in october which resulted in the recognition of million in revenue from the sale proceeds along with the acceleration of million of previously deferred revenue related to the termination of our collaboration agreement with roche  partially offset by the continued decline in our actimmune product revenue and the receipt of danoprevir related milestone payments in prior years 
we reported an increase in revenue in as compared to due to our receipt of the million milestone payment from roche in compared with the receipt of a million milestone payment in this increase offset the year over year decrease we reported in actimmune product sales 
the million in collaboration revenue in includes million recognized in connection with the termination of our collaboration agreement with roche  as well as approximately million of revenue related to the new collaboration agreement we entered into with roche in december  representing reimbursement for research services performed for roche 
the million and million of collaboration revenue for and  includes million and million of milestone payments received in september and september  respectively  each of which had been assessed as substantive and at risk at the initiation of the agreement and were therefore recognized as revenue when the milestones were achieved  as defined in the former collaboration agreement 
in  and  respectively  collaboration revenue included approximately million  million and million of amortization of the aggregate million in upfront payments received from roche in and for each of the years ended december   and  actimmune accounted for all of our product revenue and was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
a significant portion of these sales were derived from physicians prescriptions for the off label use of actimmune in the treatment of ipf 

table of contents there are a number of variables that impact actimmune revenue including  but not limited to  the discontinuation of the phase inspire clinical trial in march  the level of enrollment in ipf clinical trials of other companies  new patients started on therapy  average duration of therapy  new data on actimmune or other products presented at medical conferences  publications in medical journals  reimbursements  and patient referrals from physicians 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold include product manufacturing costs  royalties and distribution costs associated with our product revenue and inventory writedowns 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was million  or approximately of total product revenue  compared to million and million  or approximately and of total product revenue  in and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of goods sold for each year over year period primarily reflects the decline in actimmune revenue 
included in  and cost of goods sold are charges of million  million and million  respectively recorded for excess inventories 
excluding the charges for excess inventory and purchase commitments in  and  cost of goods sold was approximately  and of product revenue for each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
exchange rate fluctuations on inventory purchases may affect cost of goods sold on actimmune inventory purchased from bi 
in the past  we have utilized forward exchange contracts to partially offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations  but we did not enter into any such contracts in  or research and development expenses research and development r d expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  representing decreases of from to and from to  respectively 
the decrease in as compared to is primarily due to the timing of the preparation of regulatory filings related to pirfenidone and the divestiture of danoprevir in october the decrease in compared with is primarily attributed to completion of the capacity clinical trials in early  partially offset by increased expenses associated with the recap extension study an extension of the capacity and capacity clinical trials  the phase b study of danoprevir in patients chronically infected with hcv and the preparation of the regulatory filings for pirfenidone 
the following table lists our current product development programs and the research and development expenses recognized in connection with each program during the indicated periods 
the category titled programs non specific is comprised of facilities and personnel costs that are not allocated to a specific development program or discontinued programs and million  million and million of stock based compensation expense in  and  respectively 
our management reviews each of these program categories in evaluating our business 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with developing our products  as well as the risks and uncertainties associated with potential commercialization of our product candidates  see the specific sections under item a 
risk factors above 
year ended december  development program in thousands pulmonology hepatology programs non specific total historically  the largest component of our total operating expense was our ongoing investment in research and development and  in particular  the clinical development of our product pipeline 
the process of conducting the clinical research necessary to obtain fda approval is costly and time consuming 
current fda requirements for a new human drug to be marketed in the united states include the successful conclusion of preclinical laboratory and animal tests  if appropriate  to gain preliminary information on the product s safety  the submission of an ind with the fda to conduct human clinical trials for drugs  the successful completion of adequate and well controlled human clinical investigations to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its recommended use  and 
table of contents the submission by a company and acceptance and approval by the fda of an nda or bla for a drug product to allow commercial distribution of the drug 
in light of the factors mentioned above  we consider the active management and development of our clinical pipeline to be crucial to our long term success 
the actual probability of success for each candidate and clinical program may be impacted by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the candidate  the validity of the target and disease indication  early clinical data  investment in the program  competition  manufacturing capability and commercial viability 
due to these factors  it is difficult to give accurate guidance on the anticipated proportion of our research and development investments or the future cash inflows from these programs 
in addition  due to these same factors and others  we are unable to reasonably estimate the efforts needed and  therefore  the costs we will incur to complete any of our projects or the estimated time to complete such projects 
we are also unable to provide costs incurred for specific research and development projects within each major development program as well as the cumulative costs incurred to date given that we do not maintain specific financial records to this level of detail 
however  a substantial majority of our resources have been invested in our pirfenidone and former danoprevir projects in order to advance them into phase and phase clinical development  respectively 
the remaining projects within our hepatology research programs are in the preclinical development stage and therefore do not receive a significant amount of investment 
the actual probability of success for each candidate and clinical program may be impacted by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the candidate  the validity of the target and disease indication  early clinical data  investment in the program  competition  manufacturing capability and overall safety and efficacy profile as ultimately decided upon by the fda 
due to these factors  we believe it is difficult to give accurate guidance on the anticipated proportion of our research and development investments or the future cash inflows from these programs 
in addition  due to these same factors and others  we are unable to reasonably estimate the efforts needed and  therefore  the costs we will incur to complete any of our projects or the estimated time to complete such projects 
milestone payments to third parties we made no third party payments in related to contractual milestone obligations 
in  we made milestone payments of approximately million including approximately million in milestone payments made in connection with the initiation of the phase b study of danoprevir and a million milestone payment related to our pirfenidone program 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  representing year over year increases of and  respectively 
the increase in our g a expenses in and were primarily attributable to costs related to our preparation for the potential commercialization of pirfenidone  including establishment of a european infrastructure in and transaction costs associated with the sale of danoprevir to roche in october restructuring charges following our receipt of the complete response letter from the fda requesting an additional clinical trial to support the efficacy of pirfenidone  we initiated a reduction in force in may resulting in an aggregate restructuring charge of approximately million during  consisting primarily of severance and benefits payments made to terminated employees 
in connection with the completion and announcement of our capacity trial results  we initiated a reduction in force in february we incurred approximately million of restructuring charges during consisting primarily of severance payments to terminated employees 
loss on extinguishment of debt on june   we issued million in notes to certain holders of our existing notes in exchange for million in aggregate principal amount of their notes 
remaining debt issuance costs of approximately million  related to the extinguishment of million of the existing notes  were expensed during the second quarter of and were included in the loss on extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statements of operations  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in april and september  we entered into exchange agreements with certain holders of our notes to issue approximately million shares of common stock in exchange for approximately million principal amount of the notes then outstanding  see issuance of convertible debt above 
the exchange agreements were treated as induced conversions as the holders received a greater number of shares of common stock than would have been issued under the original conversion terms of the convertible notes 
at the time of the exchange agreements  none of the conversion contingencies were met 
under the original terms of the convertible notes  the amount payable on conversion was to be paid in cash  and the remaining conversion obligation stock price in excess of conversion price was payable in cash or shares  at our option 
under the terms of the exchange agreements  all of the settlement was paid in shares 
the difference in the value of the shares of common stock sold under the exchange agreements and the value of the shares used to derive the amount payable under the original conversion agreements resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately million in the aggregate the inducement loss 
as required by asc  upon derecognition of the notes  we remeasured the fair value of the liability and equity components using a borrowing rate for similar non convertible debt that would be applicable to us at the date of the exchange agreements 
because borrowing rates increased  the remeasurement of the components of the convertible notes resulted in a gain on extinguishment of approximately million the revaluation gain 
as a result  we recognized a net loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately million during the year ended december   calculated as the inducement loss  plus an allocation of advisory fees of approximately million  less the revaluation gain 
for more information  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest income interest income decreased to approximately million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  these decreases in interest income reflect lower average cash and securities balances throughout compared to and and successively lower average interest rates in each of the years  and interest expense interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense in as compared to was primarily due to a decline in the amortization of the debt discount related to our notes  following the reduction in our convertible note obligation in  see issuance of convertible debt above 
the decrease in interest expense in as compared to was primarily due to a decline in the amortization of the debt discount resulting from the exchange of notes in and a reduction in interest payments following the exchange of notes in april and september  refer to issuance of convertible debt above 
during  the amortization of debt discount was approximately million  compared to million in and million in additionally  each period reflects declining interest expense recorded in connection with our liability under the government settlement reached in october on january   we adopted guidance in asc as a result  we recorded additional interest expense of million in the year ended december   representing amortization of the debt discount established with our adoption of this guidance 
the adoption required retrospective application  therefore  our previously reported interest expense for the year ended december  was restated to reflect additional interest expense of million 
the following table reconciles interest expense for the year ended december  as previously reported with current year reported results in thousands year ended december  interest expense  as previously reported adjustments and reclassification amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs in connection with adoption of asc reclassification to loss on extinguishment of debt interest expense  as reported herein 
table of contents other income expense other income decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  and increased from million of other expense in other income in is comprised primarily of realized gains of approximately million from the sale of all of our remaining auction rate securities and includes approximately million related to the receipt of a federal research and development grant in the fourth quarter of pursuant to the federal qualifying therapeutic discovery project qtdp  partially offset by other expenses 
other income in consists primarily of realized gains of approximately million from the sale of our shares of targanta common stock 
other expense in is comprised primarily of a million impairment charge for the writedown of our long term available for sale auction rate securities  partially offset by a million contingent payment in connection with our divestiture of amphotec in may provision for income taxes due to our continuing operating losses and the uncertainty of our recognizing the potential future benefits from other non operating losses  we recorded a provision of approximately million for income taxes for the year ended december  we recorded a million deferred tax benefit in  primarily related to net operating losses that we had concluded to be realizable based on our estimate of future taxable income resulting from future potential sales of our shares of targanta common stock  the million tax benefit was reversed in following our sale of targanta shares in as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in if not utilized 
we also have federal research and development tax credits of approximately million that will begin to expire in the year and federal orphan drug credit carryforwards of approximately million that will begin to expire in the year in addition  we had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately million that begin to expire in and state research and development tax credits of approximately million that do not expire 
in general  section of the internal revenue code irc of  as amended  imposes annual limitations on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  other tax carryforwards and certain built in losses  as defined under that section  upon an ownership change 
we have analyzed our historical ownership changes and removed any net operating loss carryforwards that will expire unutilized from our deferred tax balances as a result of irc section limitations 
during  we utilized some of our net operating loss carryforwards and credits to reduce our current provision for income taxes 
in accordance with asc  we recorded a deferred charge during the year ended december  related to the deferral of income tax expense on inter company profits that resulted from the sale of our non us economic rights to esbriet to intermune international ag  a wholly owned subsidiary formed in the deferred charge of approximately million is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and will be amortized as a component of income tax expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations over the estimated life of the intellectual property 
we adopted the provisions of asc topic no 
 previously referred to as fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
on january  implementation of asc topic no 
did not result in any adjustment to our consolidated statements of operations or a cumulative adjustment to accumulated deficit 
income from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations in was related to the divestiture of our former infergen product line to valeant pharmaceuticals international in december we recorded income from discontinued operations of approximately million for the year ended december  resulting from an adjustment to our previous estimate of product returns related to the infergen product line 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities of million compared to million at december  the increase was primarily due to net proceeds of million from our public offering of equity in january along with the receipt of million from the sale of our worldwide rights in danoprevir to roche in october  partially offset by the use of cash for our operations as well as a payment of approximately million to pay our remaining obligation to the department of justice under the terms of the civil settlement agreement 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities as of december  are sufficient to fund our operations  as currently contemplated  at least to the end of some of these available cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in our core operating accounts 
the invested cash is invested in interest bearing 
table of contents funds managed by third party financial institutions 
we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
in addition  at any point in time we could have balances that exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits 
while we monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts on a regular basis  these cash balances could be impacted and we may be unable to access our cash if the underlying financial institutions fail or if we become subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
to date we have not experienced a lack of access to cash in any of our third party financial institution accounts 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us federal and state governments and their agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure by imposing concentration limits and credit worthiness requirements for all corporate issuers 
beginning in february  auctions failed for our entire portfolio of auction rate securities which had substantially limited the liquidity of those instruments 
however  in  we sold or redeemed our remaining portfolio of auction rate securities 
operating activities cash provided by operating activities was approximately million during the year ended december   primarily resulting from our sale of danoprevir to roche along with our realized collaboration and product sales revenues less expenses related to our cost of goods sold and cost of operations  described more fully above under the section heading  results of operations  and less changes in our working capital 
significant changes in working capital consisted of decreases in accounts receivable  product inventory  accounts payable  accrued compensation  and other accrued liabilities  including full payment of our liability under the government settlement of approximately million in investing activities investing activities consumed approximately million in cash flow during the year ended december   primarily due to purchases of investments totaling million  partially offset by maturities and sales of available for sale securities totaling million 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities of approximately million for the year ended december  was due to the receipt of million in net proceeds from our public offering of equity in january along with proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan of approximately million 
we expect to incur net losses in the near term as we continue our preparations for the commercial launch of esbriet in the european union  continue the development of pirfenidone for approval in the united states  including the launch of a new phase clinical study in the first half of  continue our research in the area of hepatology  and continue to grow our operational capabilities 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  together with anticipated cash flows from sales of actimmune will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  debt obligations and capital requirements under our current business plan through at least the next months 
this forward looking statement involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed under item a 
risk factors 
this forward looking statement is also based upon our current plans and assumptions  which may change  and our capital requirements  which may increase in future periods 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to capital requirements related to our preparations for the commercial launch of esbriet in the european union  including the expansion of our commercial infrastructure and related personnel and facility expenses  the timing and financial requirements of the launch of a phase clinical study of pirfenidone in the us  sales of actimmune or any of our product candidates in development that receive commercial approval  our ability to partner our programs or products  the progress of our research and development efforts  
table of contents the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  the costs  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  determinations as to the commercial potential of our product candidates in development  the pace of expansion of administrative expenses  the status of competitive products and competitive barriers to entry  the establishment and maintenance of manufacturing capacity through third party manufacturing agreements  the establishment of collaborative relationships with other companies  the payments of annual interest on our long term debt  and the timing and size of the payments we may receive from our collaboration agreements 
as a result  we may require substantial additional capital and may attempt to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources 
we have no commitments for such fund raising activities at this time 
furthermore  additional funding may not be available to finance our operations when needed or  if available  the terms for obtaining such funds may not be favorable or may result in dilution to our stockholders 
off balance sheet arrangements with the exception of standard operating leases  we have not engaged in any off balance sheet arrangements  including the use of structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities  such as milestone payments  for which we cannot reasonably predict future payments 
the following chart represents our contractual obligations as of december   aggregated by type in millions contractual obligations total after long term debt obligations operating leases non cancelable purchase obligations other research and development commitments total contractual cash obligations these amounts include accrued interest and principal amounts of both the convertible senior notes due and the convertible senior notes due effective march   million of notes due were converted to common stock 
these amounts consist of clinical related obligations and inventory purchase commitments 
these amounts consist of clinical  process development and other related obligations and are cancelable upon discontinuation of the trial 
we may also be required to make contingent milestone payments in the aggregate of up to million to the licensors of certain of our licensed products or the suppliers of our drug compounds in accordance with the specific license  commercialization and collaboration agreements if all of the milestones per the agreements are achieved  which include development and regulatory approval milestones 
these amounts are not included in the above table 
included in the million in future aggregate milestone payments are aggregate milestone payments of million payable to array and novartis  of which roche has agreed to reimburse us in connection with our sale of danoprevir to roche 
the operating leases for our facilities require letters of credit secured by a restricted cash balance with our bank 
the amount of each letter of credit approximates six to twelve months of operating rent payable to the landlord of each facility 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued update no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu 
it updates the existing multiple element revenue arrangements guidance currently included under asc  which originated primarily from the guidance in eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
the revised guidance primarily provides two significant changes eliminates the need for objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for the undelivered element in order for a delivered item to be treated as a separate unit of accounting  and eliminates the residual method to allocate the arrangement consideration 
in addition  the guidance also expands the disclosure requirements for revenue recognition 
asu will be effective for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted provided that the revised guidance is retroactively applied to the beginning of the year of adoption 
we believe that the adoption of this update will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued update no 
 milestone method of revenue recognition a consensus of the emerging issues task force 
the objective of the update is to provide guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research or development transactions 
this guidance is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after june  we believe that the adoption of this update will have no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and market risk the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale and are  due to their short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge our interest rate risk exposure 
because of the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that a change in market rates would have a significant negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including obligations of us government sponsored enterprises  municipal notes which may have an auction reset feature  corporate notes and bonds  commercial paper  and money market funds 
these securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
substantially all investments mature within approximately one year from the date of purchase 
our holdings of the securities of any one issuer  except obligations of us government sponsored enterprises  do not exceed of the portfolio 
if interest rates rise  the market value of our investments may decline  which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risks 
the table below presents the original principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio as of december  by effective maturity in millions  except percentages and beyond total fair value at december  assets available for sale securities average interest rate liabilities convertible senior notes due average interest rate convertible senior notes due average interest rate 
table of contents the table below presents the original principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio as of december  by effective maturity in millions  except percentages and beyond total fair value at december  assets available for sale securities average interest rate liabilities convertible senior notes due average interest rate convertible senior notes due average interest rate foreign currency market risk we purchase commercial and clinical products from bi and settle our obligations in a foreign currency 
this exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we also have a portion of our assets invested within our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries that exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
to protect against currency exchange risks on forecasted foreign currency cash payments for the purchases of actimmune from bi over the next year  we have considered instituting a foreign currency cash flow hedging program 
in the past  we have hedged portions of our forecasted foreign currency cash payments with forward contracts 
when the dollar strengthens significantly against the foreign currencies  the decline in the value of future foreign currency expenses is offset by losses in the value of the option or forward contracts designated as hedges 
conversely  when the dollar weakens  the increase in the value of future foreign currency expenses is offset by gains in the value of the forward contracts 
in  we used foreign currency forward contracts to partially mitigate this exposure  but have not entered into any new foreign currency forward contracts since that time 
we regularly evaluate the cost benefit of entering into such arrangements  and presently have no foreign currency hedge agreements outstanding as we believe our exposure to currency exchange rate risk is minimal 
global market and economic conditions in the united states  recent market and economic conditions have been challenging with tighter credit conditions and sluggish economic growth which began in for the fiscal year ended december   concerns about the systemic impact of inflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market  high unemployment and a declining real estate market in the us and added concerns fueled by the federal government interventions in the us financial and credit markets have contributed to instability in both united states and international capital and credit markets and have diminished expectations for the us and global economy 
these conditions  combined with volatile energy prices  declining business and consumer confidence and continued high unemployment have contributed to volatility in the markets and have led to a broad economic slowdown 
as a result of these market conditions  the cost and availability of capital and credit has been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
if volatile and adverse market conditions continue  they may limit our ability to timely borrow or access the capital and credit markets to meet liquidity needs  resulting in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the economic slowdown may lead to reduced opportunities to raise sufficient additional capital to enable us to fund future operations  which would have a negative impact on our business 
in addition  the biotechnology industry has fluctuated significantly in the past and has experienced significant downturns in connection with  or in anticipation of  a deterioration in general economic conditions and we cannot accurately predict how severe and prolonged any downturn might be
