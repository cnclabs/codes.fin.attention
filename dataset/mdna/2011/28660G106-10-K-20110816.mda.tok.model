table of contents in fiscal  gross margins improved as compared to the prior fiscal year by approximately basis points 
going into fiscal  we intend to continue to focus on expanding gross margins through increased focus on product mix  improved pricing and reduced sales dilution  continuing our focus on improving our sales and operations planning processes and our supply chain and logistics efficiency and leveraging our overhead structure by increasing sales of our international segment 
we expect our fiscal gross margins to improve an additional to basis points over our fiscal gross margin 
we expect to use a portion of this anticipated margin improvement to support organic growth of our key brands and drive improved profitability 
we have implemented a turnkey model for substantially all our fragrance and color cosmetic products in which our contract manufacturers have assumed the administrative responsibility for planning and purchasing raw materials and components  while we continue to govern strategic sourcing and pricing with all raw materials and components vendors 
we expect to continue to implement this turnkey manufacturing model with respect to our skin care products during fiscal we manage our business by evaluating net sales  gross margins  ebitda as defined in note under item selected financial data  ebitda margin  segment profit and working capital utilization including monitoring our levels of inventory  accounts receivable  operating cash flow and return on invested capital 
we encounter a variety of challenges that may affect our business and should be considered as described in item a risk factors and in the section management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking information and factors that may affect future results 
effective june   we became the exclusive  global licensee for the manufacture  distribution  marketing and sale of the liz claiborne fragrance brands under a long term license agreement with liz claiborne  inc and certain of its affiliates 
in fiscal  we incurred transition expenses relating to the liz claiborne license agreement of approximately million  before taxes 
in addition  our gross margins for the first half of fiscal were impacted by expenses of approximately million which did not require the use of cash in the current period  before taxes  relating to liz claiborne inventory that we purchased at a higher cost prior to the effective date of the license agreement 
on august   we amended our long term license agreement with liz claiborne  inc and certain of its affiliates to acquire all of the us and international trademarks for the curve fragrance brands  as well as trademarks for certain other smaller fragrance brands 
the amendment also establishes a lower effective royalty rate for the remaining licensed fragrance brands  including juicy couture and lucky brand fragrances  reduces the future minimum guaranteed royalties for the term of the license  and requires a pre payment of royalties for the remainder of calendar we paid liz claiborne  inc million in cash in connection with this transaction 
the allocation of the million to the net assets acquired has not been finalized 
during fiscal  we substantially completed the implementation of a series of activities intended to increase business efficiencies throughout our company  particularly in the supply chain  distribution  logistics  information technology and finance areas  to improve our cash flow  operating margins and profitability and to accommodate the anticipated growth of our business 
we call this effort our global efficiency re engineering initiative  or simply the initiative  and it consists of i improvements in the efficiency of our supply chain  distribution  logistics and business processes  ii a migration to a shared services model to simplify transaction processing by consolidating our primary global transaction processing functions  and iii the implementation of an oracle financial accounting and order processing system 
in connection with the initiative  we implemented a restructuring plan that resulted in restructuring and one time expenses  including severance  relocation  recruiting and temporary staffing expenditures 
substantially all of these expenses were incurred in fiscal years and from inception through june   we incurred a total of million before taxes  which included million related to our oracle system implementation  and million for logo 
table of contents initiative related restructuring 
we do not expect to incur any additional expenses related to the initiative and the total amount from inception of million is consistent with our original projection of million to million 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in those consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors that we believe are most likely to occur 
changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates  which are recorded in the period in which they become known 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
if these changes result in a material impact to the consolidated financial statements  their impact is disclosed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and or in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the disclosures below also note situations in which it is reasonably likely that future financial results could be affected by changes in these estimates and assumptions 
the term reasonably likely refers to an occurrence that is more than remote but less than probable in the judgment of management 
our most critical accounting policies and estimates are described in detail below 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements general information and summary of significant accounting policies  for a discussion of these and other accounting policies 
accounting for acquisitions and intangible assets 
under the accounting for business combinations  consideration paid in an acquisition is allocated to the underlying net assets  based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the consideration paid at the acquisition date over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value and expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can significantly affect net income 
for example  different classes of assets will have useful lives that differ  and the useful life of property  plant  and equipment acquired will differ substantially from the useful life of brand licenses and trademarks 
consequently  to the extent a longer lived asset is ascribed greater value under the purchase method than a shorter lived asset  net income in a given period may be higher 
determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
one of the areas that requires more judgment is determining the fair value and useful life of intangible assets 
in this process  we often obtain the assistance of third party valuation firms for certain intangible assets 
because the fair value and the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is a subjective estimate  it is reasonably likely that circumstances may cause the estimate to change 
for example  if we discontinue or experience a decline in the profitability of one or more of our brands  the value of the intangible assets associated with those brands or their useful lives may decline  or  certain intangible assets such as the elizabeth arden brand trademarks  may no longer be classified as an indefinite lived asset  which could result in additional charges to net income 
our intangible assets consist of exclusive brand licenses  trademarks  patents and other intellectual property  customer relationships and lists  non compete agreements and goodwill 
the value of these assets is exposed to future adverse changes if we experience declines in operating results or experience significant negative industry or economic trends 
we have determined that the elizabeth arden trademarks have indefinite useful lives as cash flows from the use of the trademarks are expected to be generated indefinitely 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives such as our elizabeth arden trademarks  are not amortized  but rather tested for impairment at least annually 
we typically perform our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill logo 
table of contents may not fully be recoverable 
there is a two step process for impairment testing of goodwill 
the first step used to identify potential impairment compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the second step  if necessary  measures the amount of the impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the goodwill and intangible assets to their respective carrying values 
if an impairment is identified  the carrying value of the asset is adjusted to estimated fair value 
during the quarter ended june   we completed our annual impairment testing of the elizabeth arden trademarks  with the assistance of a third party valuation firm 
during the quarter ended june   we also completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill 
in assessing the fair value of these assets  we considered the income approach and market approach 
under the income approach  the fair value is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
under the market approach  the fair value is based on quoted market prices and the number of shares outstanding of our common stock 
the analysis and assessments of these assets and goodwill indicated that no impairment adjustment was required as the estimated fair value exceeded the recorded carrying value 
a hypothetical decrease to the fair value of our elizabeth arden trademarks or a hypothetical increase in the discount rate used to estimate fair value would not result in an impairment of our elizabeth arden trademarks 
a hypothetical decrease in the fair value of our north america reporting unit would not result in an impairment of our goodwill 
due to the ongoing uncertainty in capital market conditions  we will continue to monitor and evaluate the expected future cash flows of our reporting units and the long term trends of our market capitalization for the purposes of assessing the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite lived elizabeth arden trademarks  other trademarks and intangible assets 
if market and economic conditions deteriorate  this could increase the likelihood of future material non cash impairment charges to our results of operations related to our goodwill  indefinite lived elizabeth arden trademarks  or other trademarks and intangible assets 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization is provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight line method 
periodically  we review the lives assigned to our long lived assets and adjust the lives  as circumstances dictate 
because estimated useful life is a subjective estimate  it is reasonably likely that circumstances may cause the estimate to change 
for example  if we experience significant declines in net sales in certain channels of distribution  it could affect the estimated useful life of certain of our long lived assets  such as counters or trade fixtures  which could result in additional charges to net income 
long lived assets 
we review for the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset compared to its carrying value 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
because the fair value is a subjective estimate  it is reasonably likely that circumstances may cause the estimate to change 
the same circumstances that could affect the estimated useful life of a long lived asset  as discussed above  could cause us to change our estimate of the fair value of that asset  which could result in additional charges to net income 
we did not record any adjustments to our long lived assets in fiscal  and long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
revenue recognition 
sales are recognized when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the resulting receivable is probable 
sales are recorded net of estimated returns  markdowns and other allowances 
the provision for sales returns and markdowns represents management s estimate of future returns and markdowns based on historical experience and considering current external factors and market conditions 
allowances for sales returns and markdowns 
as is customary in the prestige beauty business  we grant certain of our customers primarily north american prestige department stores and logo 
table of contents specialty beauty stores subject to our authorization and approval  the right to either return product for credit against amounts previously billed or to receive a markdown allowance 
upon sale to such customers  we record a provision for product returns and markdowns estimated based on our level of sales  historical and projected experience with product returns and markdowns in each of our business segments and with respect to each of our product types  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and customer mix 
we make detailed estimates at the segment  product and customer level  which are then aggregated to arrive at a consolidated provision for product returns and markdowns and are reviewed periodically as facts and circumstances warrant 
such provisions and markdown allowances are recorded as a reduction of net sales 
because there is considerable judgment used in evaluating the allowance for returns and markdowns  it is reasonably likely that actual experience will differ from our estimates 
if  for example  customer demand for our products is lower than estimated or a proportionately greater amount of sales is made to prestige department stores and or specialty beauty stores  additional provisions for returns or markdowns may be required resulting in a charge to income in the period in which the determination was made 
similarly  if customer demand for our products is higher than estimated  a reduction of our provision for returns or markdowns may be required resulting in an increase to income in the period in which the determination was made 
as a percentage of gross sales  our expense for returns and markdowns was  and for the fiscal years ending june   and  respectively 
a hypothetical change in the value of our allowance for sales returns and markdowns as of june  would result in a million change to net income 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover uncollectible accounts receivable  and we evaluate our accounts receivable to determine if they will ultimately be collected 
this evaluation includes significant judgments and estimates  including an analysis of receivables aging and a customer by customer review for large accounts 
it is reasonably likely that actual experience will differ from our estimates  which may result in an increase or decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if  for example  the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay  additional allowances may be required  resulting in a charge to income in the period in which the determination was made 
a hypothetical change in the value of our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable as of june  would result in a million change to net income 
provisions for inventory obsolescence 
we record a provision for estimated obsolescence and shrinkage of inventory 
our estimates consider the cost of inventory  forecasted demand  the estimated market value  the shelf life of the inventory and our historical experience 
because of the subjective nature of this estimate  it is reasonably likely that circumstances may cause the estimate to change 
if  for example  demand for our products declines or if we decide to discontinue certain products  we may need to increase our provision for inventory obsolescence which would result in additional charges to net income 
a hypothetical change in the value of our provision for inventory obsolescence as of june  would result in a million change to net income 
hedge contracts 
we have designated each qualifying foreign currency contract we have entered into as a cash flow hedge 
unrealized gains or losses  net of taxes  associated with these contracts are included in accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet 
gains and losses will only be recognized in earnings in the period in which the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
share based compensation 
all share based payments to employees  including the grants of employee stock options  are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values  but only to the extent that vesting is considered probable 
compensation cost for awards that vest will not be reversed if the awards expire without being exercised 
the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
compensation costs for awards are amortized using the straight line method 
option pricing model input assumptions such as expected term  expected volatility and risk free interest rate impact the fair value estimate 
further  the forfeiture rate impacts the amount of aggregate compensation 
these assumptions are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop 
when estimating fair logo 
table of contents value  some of the assumptions are based on or determined from external data and other assumptions may be derived from our historical experience with share based arrangements 
the appropriate weight to place on historical experience is a matter of judgment  based on relevant facts and circumstances 
we rely on our historical experience and post vested termination activity to provide data for estimating our expected term for use in determining the fair value of our stock options 
we currently estimate our stock volatility by considering our historical stock volatility experience and other key factors 
the risk free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term used as the input to the black scholes model 
we estimate forfeitures using our historical experience 
our estimates of forfeitures will be adjusted over the requisite service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from their estimates 
because of the significant amount of judgment used in these calculations  it is reasonably likely that circumstances may cause the estimate to change 
if  for example  actual forfeitures are lower than our estimate  additional charges to net income may be required 
income taxes and valuation reserves 
a valuation allowance may be required to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing a potential valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we may not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  or that new estimates indicate that a previously recorded valuation allowance is no longer required  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would likely be charged or credited to net income in the period in which such determination was made 
we recognize in our consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position if it is more likely than not that such position will be sustained on audit based on its technical merits 
while we believe that our assessments of whether our tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained are reasonable  each assessment is subjective and requires the use of significant judgments 
as a result  one or more of such assessments may prove ultimately to be incorrect  which could result in a change to net income 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency contracts we operate in several foreign countries  which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
our risk management policy is to enter into cash flow hedges to reduce a portion of the exposure of our foreign subsidiaries revenues to fluctuations in currency rates using foreign currency forward contracts 
we also enter into cash flow hedges for a portion of our forecasted inventory purchases to reduce the exposure of our canadian and australian subsidiaries cost of sales to such fluctuations 
the principal currencies hedged are british pounds  euros  canadian dollars and australian dollars 
we do not enter into derivative financial contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
changes to fair value of the foreign currency contracts are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within shareholders equity  to the extent such contracts are effective  and are recognized in net sales or cost of sales in the period in which the forecasted transaction affects earnings or the transactions are no longer probable of occurring 
changes to fair value of any contracts deemed to be ineffective would be recognized in earnings immediately 
there were no amounts recorded in the fiscal years ended june   or relating to foreign currency contracts used to hedge forecasted revenues or forecasted inventory purchases resulting from hedge ineffectiveness 
when appropriate  we also enter into and settle foreign currency contracts for euros  british pounds and canadian dollars to reduce exposure of our foreign subsidiaries balance sheets to fluctuations in foreign currency rates 
these contracts are used to hedge balance sheet exposure logo 
table of contents generally over one month and are settled before the end of the month in which they are entered into 
changes to fair value of the forward contracts are recognized in selling  general and administrative expense in the period in which the contracts expire

future liquidity and capital needs 
our principal future uses of funds are for working capital requirements  including brand and product development and marketing expenses  new product launches  additional brand acquisitions or product licensing and distribution arrangements  capital expenditures and debt service 
in addition  we may use funds to repurchase material amounts of our common stock and senior notes through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise  depending upon prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  logo 
table of contents contractual restrictions and other factors 
we have historically financed our working capital needs primarily through internally generated funds  our credit facility and external financing 
we collect cash from our customers based on our sales to them and their respective payment terms 
we have a revolving bank credit facility with a syndicate of banks  for which jpmorgan chase bank is the administrative agent  which generally provides for borrowings on a revolving basis 
in january  the credit facility was amended to  among other things i reduce its size from million to million  with a sub limit of million for letters of credit  ii revise the interest rate and unused commitment fee applicable under the credit facility  and iii extend its maturity from december to january under the terms of the credit facility  we may  at any time  increase the size of the credit facility up to million without entering into a formal amendment requiring the consent of all of the banks  subject to our satisfaction of certain conditions 
the credit facility is guaranteed by all of our us subsidiaries and is collateralized by a first priority lien on all of our us accounts receivable and inventory 
borrowings under the new credit facility are limited to of eligible accounts receivable and of the appraised net liquidation value of our inventory  as determined pursuant to the terms of the credit facility  provided  however  that from august to october of each year  our borrowing base may be temporarily increased by up to million 
the credit facility has only one financial maintenance covenant  which is a debt service coverage ratio that must be maintained at not less than to if average borrowing base capacity declines to less than million million from september through january 
our average borrowing base capacity for each of the quarters during fiscal did not fall below the applicable thresholds noted above 
accordingly  the debt service coverage ratio did not apply during the year ended june  we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under the credit facility for the quarter and year ended june  under the terms of the credit facility  we may pay dividends or repurchase common stock if we maintain borrowing base capacity of at least million from february to august  and at least million from september to january  after making the applicable payment 
the credit facility restricts us from incurring additional non trade indebtedness other than refinancings and certain small amounts of indebtedness 
borrowings under the credit portion of the credit facility bear interest at a floating rate based on an applicable margin which is determined by reference to a debt service coverage ratio 
at our option  the applicable margin may be applied to either the london interbank offered rate libor or the base rate 
the applicable margin charged on libor loans ranges from to and ranges from to for base rate loans  except that the applicable margin on the first million of borrowings from august to october of each year  while the temporary increase in our borrowing base is in effect  is higher 
we are required to pay an unused commitment fee ranging from to based on the quarterly average unused portion of the credit facility 
the interest rates payable by us on our senior notes and on borrowings under our revolving credit facility are not impacted by credit rating agency actions 
at june   the applicable margin was for libor loans and for prime rate loans 
the commitment fee on the unused portion of the credit facility at june  was 
for both the years ended june  and  the weighted average annual interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility was 
at june   we had i no outstanding borrowings and million in letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility  ii million of eligible accounts receivable and inventories available as collateral under the credit facility  and iii remaining borrowing availability of million 
the borrowing availability under the credit facility typically declines in the second half of our fiscal year as our higher accounts receivable balances resulting from holiday season sales are likely to decline due to cash collections 
logo 
table of contents at june   we had outstanding million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due march interest on the senior notes accrues at a rate of per annum and will be payable semi annually on march and september of every year  commencing on september  the senior notes rank pari passu in right of payment to indebtedness under our credit facility and any other senior debt  and will rank senior to any future subordinated indebtedness  provided  however  that the senior notes are effectively subordinated to the credit facility to the extent of the collateral securing the credit facility 
the indenture applicable to the senior notes generally permits us subject to the satisfaction of a fixed charge coverage ratio and  in certain cases  also a net income test to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  purchase or redeem our common stock or redeem subordinated indebtedness 
the indenture generally limits our ability to create liens  merge or transfer or sell assets 
the indenture also provides that the holders of the senior notes have the option to require us to repurchase their notes in the event of a change of control involving us as defined in the indenture 
the senior notes initially will not be guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries but could become guaranteed in the future by any domestic subsidiary of ours that guarantees or incurs certain indebtedness in excess of million 
on august   we amended our long term license agreement with liz claiborne  inc and certain of its affiliates to acquire all of the us and international trademarks for the curve fragrance brands  as well as trademarks for certain other smaller fragrance brands 
the amendment also establishes a lower effective royalty rate for the remaining licensed fragrance brands  including juicy couture and lucky brand fragrances  reduces the future minimum guaranteed royalties for the term of the license  and requires a pre payment of royalties for the remainder of calendar we paid liz claiborne  inc million in cash in connection with this transaction 
the allocation of the million to the net assets acquired has not been finalized 
based upon our internal projections  we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents  internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to cover debt service  working capital requirements and capital expenditures for the next twelve months  other than additional working capital requirements that may result from further expansion of our operations through acquisitions of additional brands or licensing or distribution arrangements 
a deterioration in the economic and retail environment  however  could cause us to fail to satisfy the financial maintenance covenant under our credit facility that applies only in the event we do not have the requisite average borrowing base capacity as set forth under the credit facility 
in such an event  we would not be allowed to borrow under the credit facility and may not have access to the capital necessary for our business 
in addition  a default under our credit facility that causes acceleration of the debt under this facility could trigger a default under our outstanding senior notes 
in the event we are not able to borrow under our credit facility  we would be required to develop an alternative source of liquidity 
there is no assurance that we could obtain replacement financing or what the terms of such financing  if available  would be 
we have discussions from time to time with manufacturers and owners of prestige fragrance brands regarding our possible acquisition of additional exclusive licensing and or distribution rights 
we currently have no material agreements or commitments with respect to any such acquisition  although we periodically execute routine agreements to maintain the confidentiality of information obtained during the course of discussions with such manufacturers and brand owners 
there is no assurance that we will be able to negotiate successfully for any such future acquisitions or that we will be able to obtain acquisition financing or additional working capital financing on satisfactory terms for further expansion of our operations

borrowings under our revolving credit facility are seasonal  with peak borrowings typically in the months of september  october and november
