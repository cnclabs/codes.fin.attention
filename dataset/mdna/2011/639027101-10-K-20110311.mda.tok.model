this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes in item of this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements 
please see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements for the risks  uncertainties and assumptions associated with these forward looking statements 
overview our business  industry and target market nature s sunshine products  inc and its subsidiaries are primarily engaged in the manufacturing and marketing of herbal products  vitamin and mineral supplements  personal care and miscellaneous related products 
nature s sunshine products  inc is a utah corporation with its principal place of business in provo  utah 
we sell our products to a sales force of independent distributors and managers who use the products themselves or resell them to other distributors or consumers 
the formulation  manufacturing  packaging  labeling  advertising  distribution and sale of each of our major product groups are subject to regulation by one or more governmental agencies 
we also sell our products through a separate division and operating business segment  synergy worldwide  which was acquired by us in synergy worldwide offers products with formulations sufficiently different from those of the nature s sunshine products offerings to warrant its treatment as a separately reportable business segment 
in addition  synergy worldwide s marketing and distributor compensation plans are sufficiently different from those of nature s sunshine products to warrant accounting for these operations as a separate business segment 
we market our products in australia  austria  belarus  canada  the czech republic  colombia  costa rica  the dominican republic  ecuador  el salvador  germany  guatemala  honduras  hong kong  indonesia  israel  japan  kazakhstan  latvia  lithuania  malaysia  mexico  mongolia  the netherlands  nicaragua  norway  panama  peru  the philippines  poland  russia  singapore  south korea  sweden  taiwan  thailand  ukraine  the united kingdom  the united states  venezuela and vietnam 
we export our products to several other countries  including argentina  australia  chile  new zealand and norway 
in  we experienced an increase in net sales revenue of approximately percent 
this increase was primarily related to increased sales in our synergy worldwide segment of percent and  to a lesser extent  our nsp international segment of percent  and was offset by a percent decrease in sales in our nsp united states segment 
within our foreign markets  we saw improvements due to the weakening of the us dollar against many of the foreign currencies in which our subsidiaries operate and the resulting positive impact on consumer demand in these markets  as well as a general strengthening of the economies in many of these markets 
the most positive impact on net sales revenue during was from our us synergy worldwide  european  russian and korean markets 
gains in these markets were offset in part by decreases in venezuela due to the devaluation of its currency  as well as continued weakness in our japanese  indonesian and us nsp united states markets 
during  we also ceased our operations in brazil as a result of increased import regulations and declining sales 
as a result  we have reclassified the brazil subsidiary s operations to discontinued operations and recorded a charge of million  of which million is related to a non cash write off of accumulated currency translation adjustments 
this market represented less than percent of our consolidated net sales for we distribute our products to consumers through an independent sales force comprised of managers and distributors 
typically a person who joins our independent sales force begins as a distributor 
a distributor interested in earning additional income by committing more time and effort to selling our products may earn manager status  which is contingent upon attaining certain purchase levels  recruiting additional distributors and demonstrating leadership abilities 
on a worldwide basis  active managers totaled approximately  and  and active distributors totaled approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
we anticipate that the number of active distributors will increase as we grow our existing operations and enter new international markets  and as current distributors grow their businesses 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and form the basis for the following discussion and analysis on critical accounting policies and estimates 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on a regular basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the 
table of contents basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates and those differences could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the board of directors and its audit committee 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
we believe the critical accounting policies and estimates described below reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the impact and any associated risks on our business that are related to these policies are also discussed throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
revenue recognition net sales revenue and related volume incentive expenses are recorded when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  collectability is reasonably assured  the amount is fixed and determinable  and title and risk of loss have passed  generally when the merchandise has been delivered 
the amount of the volume incentive is determined based upon the amount of qualifying purchases in a given month 
it is necessary for us to make estimates about the timing of when merchandise has been delivered 
these estimates are based upon our historical experience related to time in transit  and timing of when shipments occurred and shipping volumes 
amounts received for undelivered merchandise are recorded as deferred revenue 
from time to time  our us operations extend short term credit associated with product promotions 
in addition for certain of our international operations  we offer credit terms consistent with industry standards within the country of operation 
payments to distributors and managers for sales incentives or rebates are recorded as a reduction of revenue 
payments for sales incentives and rebates are calculated monthly based upon qualifying sales 
membership fees are deferred and amortized as revenue over the life of the membership  primarily one year 
prepaid event registration fees are deferred and recognized as revenues when the related event is held 
a reserve for product returns is recorded based upon historical experience 
we allow distributors or managers to return the unused portion of products within ninety days of purchase if they are not satisfied with the product 
in some of our markets  the requirements to return product are more restrictive 
sales returns for the years  and  were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
accounts receivable allowances accounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance for amounts that may be uncollectible in the future 
this estimated allowance is based primarily on the aging category  historical trends and management s evaluation of the financial condition of the customer 
this reserve is adjusted periodically as information about specific accounts becomes available 
investments our available for sale investment portfolio is recorded at fair value and consists of various fixed income securities such as us government and state and municipal bonds  mutual funds  depository certificates and equity securities 
these investments are valued using a quoted prices for identical assets in active markets or b from significant inputs that are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset 
our trading portfolio is recorded at fair value and consists of various marketable securities that are valued using quoted prices in active markets 
for available for sale debt securities with unrealized losses  we perform an analysis to assess whether it intends to sell or whether it would be more likely than not required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis 
where we intend to sell a security  or may be required to do so  the security s decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary and the full amount of the unrealized loss is recorded within earnings as an impairment loss 
for all other debt securities that experience a decline in fair value that is determined to be other than temporary and not related to credit loss  we record a loss  net of any tax  in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the credit loss is recorded within earnings as an impairment loss when sold 
management judgment is involved in evaluating whether a decline in an investment s fair value is other than temporary 
regardless of our intent to sell a security  we perform additional analysis on all securities with unrealized losses to evaluate losses associated with the creditworthiness of the security 
credit losses are identified where we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of a security 
for equity securities  when assessing whether a decline in fair value below our cost basis is other than temporary  we consider the fair market value of the security  the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost  the financial 
table of contents condition and near term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient time in order to enable recovery of our cost 
new information and the passage of time can change these judgments 
where we have determined that we lack the intent and ability to hold an equity security to its expected recovery  the security s decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary and is recorded within earnings as an impairment loss 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out method 
the components of inventory cost include raw materials  labor and overhead 
to estimate any necessary lower of cost or market adjustments  various assumptions are made in regard to excess or slow moving inventories  non conforming inventories  expiration dates  current and future product demand  production planning and market conditions 
self insurance liabilities similar to other manufacturers and distributors of products that are ingested  we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that  among other things  the use of our products results in injury to consumers due to tampering by unauthorized third parties or product contamination 
we have historically had a very limited number of product claims or reports from individuals who have asserted that they have suffered adverse consequences as a result of using our products 
these matters have historically been settled to our satisfaction and have not resulted in material payments 
we have established a wholly owned captive insurance company to provide us with product liability insurance coverage and have accrued a reserve that we believe is sufficient to cover probable and reasonable estimable liabilities related to product liability claims based upon our history 
however  there can be no assurance that these estimates will prove to be sufficient  nor can there be any assurance that the ultimate outcome of any litigation for product liability will not have a material negative impact on our business prospects  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we self insure for certain employee medical benefits 
the recorded liabilities for self insured risks are calculated using actuarial methods and are not discounted 
the liabilities include amounts for actual claims and claims incurred but not reported 
actual experience  including claim frequency and severity as well as health care inflation  could result in actual liabilities being more or less than the amounts currently recorded 
impairment of long lived assets we review our long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment and intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we use an estimate of future undiscounted net cash flows of the related assets or groups of assets over their remaining lives in measuring whether the assets are recoverable 
an impairment loss is calculated by determining the difference between the carrying values and the fair values of these assets 
we did not consider any of our long lived assets to be impaired during the years ended december   or incentive trip accrual we accrue for expenses for incentive trips associated with our direct sales marketing program  which rewards independent distributors and managers with paid attendance at our conventions and meetings 
expenses associated with incentive trips are accrued over qualification periods as they are earned 
we specifically analyze incentive trip accruals based on historical and current sales trends as well as contractual obligations when evaluating the adequacy of the incentive trip accrual 
actual results could generate liabilities more or less than the amounts recorded 
we have accrued convention and meeting costs of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  which are included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
the difference in the accrued liabilities at the year ends is due to the change in the timing of nsp united states national convention 
contingencies we are involved in certain legal proceedings 
when a loss is considered probable in connection with litigation or non income tax contingencies and when such loss can be reasonably estimated with a range  we record our best estimate within the range related to the contingency 
if there is no best estimate  we record the minimum of the range 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to the contingency and revise the estimates 
revision in estimates of the potential liabilities could materially affect our results of operations in the period of adjustment 
our accounting for venezuela s classification as a highly inflationary economy is discussed in further detail in note  nature of operations and significant accounting policies  to the notes of our consolidated financial statements  in item  part of this report 

table of contents income taxes our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and contingent reserves reflect management s best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the company s consolidated income tax expense 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in projecting future taxable income  we develop assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and foreign pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates that we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
valuation allowances are recorded as reserves against net deferred tax assets by the company when it is determined that net deferred tax assets are not likely to be realized in the foreseeable future 
as of december  and  we had recorded valuation allowances of million and million  respectively  as offsets to our net deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had foreign income tax net operating loss carryforwards of million  which will expire at various dates from through the company had approximately million of foreign tax credits  which begin to expire at various dates starting in changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold to be recognized 
share based compensation we recognize all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their granted date fair values 
we record compensation expense  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  over the vesting period of the stock options based on the fair value of the stock options on the date of grant 
we estimated forfeiture rate is based upon historical experience

in addition  improved manager and distributor recruiting efforts have contributed to growth in this market

income taxes our effective income tax rate was percent for  compared to percent for the effective rate for differed from the federal statutory rate of percent primarily due to the following

iii adjustments relating to the us tax impact of foreign operations increased the effective tax rate by percentage points in included were adjustments for dividends received from foreign subsidiaries  adjustments for foreign tax credits and adjustments relating to outside basis calculations under applicable us gaap 
changes to the effective rate due to dividends received from foreign subsidiaries  adjustments for foreign tax credits and outside basis are expected to be recurring 
iv foreign tax rate differentials that incrementally affect the federal statutory rate decreased the effective tax rate by approximately percent 
this is primarily due to the company not recording a benefit for losses in most jurisdictions where tax losses exist  particularly with respect to the company s markets in asia 
some of these losses may be recurring or may result in benefits in future periods if these markets return to profitability 
v changes in the deferred tax asset valuations allowance increased the effective tax rate by approximately percent in the change in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was primarily the result of reserves being established for certain foreign affiliate deferred tax assets that were not likely to be realized due to recurring losses within the respective tax jurisdictions

volume incentives volume incentives are a significant part of our direct sales marketing program and represent commission payments made to our independent distributors and managers 
these payments are designed to provide incentives for reaching higher sales levels and for recruiting additional distributors 
volume incentives vary slightly  on a percentage basis  by product due to our pricing policies and commission plans in place in our international operations 
volume incentives as a percent of net sales revenue decreased to percent in  compared to percent in the decrease was partially due to fewer distributors qualifying for payouts at higher rates due to lower sales volumes in russia  ukraine  mexico and japan  as well as reductions in the volume incentive programs for some products sold within the united states 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to percent of net sales revenue in  compared to percent in  or by approximately million in compared to  from million to million 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was the result of decreased spending of approximately million in our russian  ukrainian and other eastern european markets due to the significant declines in our net sales revenues in these markets  decreases in non income tax related contingencies of million related to favorable settlements for nsp united states  million of favorable settlements related to value added tax contingencies within some of the markets in which synergy operates  as well as decreased professional fees within the united states of million related to our efforts to become current in our financial reporting 
in addition  foreign currency fluctuations reduced selling  general and administrative expenses by approximately million  of which million was related to exchange rate changes in mexico 
these decreases were offset by increases of approximately million of value added tax related contingencies within some of the foreign markets in which nsp international operates  as well as an increase of million related to the settlement of the sec investigation of the company 
excluding the items noted above  selling  general and administrative expenses in our nsp international and synergy worldwide segments increased as a percentage of sales in as a result of reduced sales in some the key markets in which we operate as noted in the net sales revenue discussion above 
operating income operating income increased approximately million during the year ended december   compared to the same period in  from million to million 
the operating income for nsp united states increased approximately million for the year ended december   from an operating loss of million for the same period in  to operating income of million in this increase was the result of declines in volume incentives as a percentage of net sales revenues  the reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses primarily due to decreases in the reduction in non income tax related accruals and professional fees  as noted above 
operating income for nsp international decreased approximately million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in to million during this decrease was the result of declining net sales in many of the markets in which nsp international operates due to general economic conditions within these markets  as well as the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  as noted above in the discussion of net sales revenue 
the conditions had a more significant impact earlier in the operating loss in synergy worldwide decreased million to operating income of million in  compared to an 
table of contents operating loss of million for the same period in this improvement was due to a favorable settlement of value added tax related contingencies in some of its foreign markets as noted above 
excluding this factor  synergy worldwide s operating loss decreased to million  an improvement of million primarily due to the increases in net sales revenue for its european  indonesian and united states markets  as well as continued cost cutting efforts in each of its markets 
the net impact of foreign currency fluctuations on operating income included in the operating results of nsp international and synergy worldwide was million 
other income  net other income  net for the year ended december   decreased million compared to the same period in primarily due to foreign exchange gains in certain markets based upon changes in exchange rates on intercompany related balances and us dollar denominated cash accounts 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was percent for  compared to percent for the effective rate for differed from the federal statutory rate of percent primarily due to the following i the amortization of a prepaid tax resulting from a taxable gain on the sale of intercompany assets eliminated for reporting purposes  but recognized for the calculation of the consolidated income tax provision  increased the effective tax rate by approximately percent in the prepaid tax is being amortized over the respective life of the asset 
ii adjustments relating to the us tax impact of foreign operations decreased the effective tax rate by percentage points in included were adjustments for dividends received from foreign subsidiaries  adjustments for foreign tax credits and adjustments relating to outside basis calculations under applicable us gaap 
changes to the effective rate due to dividends received from foreign subsidiaries  adjustments for foreign tax credits and outside basis are expected to be recurring 
iii foreign tax rate differentials that incrementally affect the federal statutory rate increased the effective tax rate by approximately percent 
this is primarily due to the company not recording a benefit for losses in most jurisdictions where tax losses exist  particularly with respect to the company s markets in asia 
some of these losses may be recurring or may result in benefits in future periods if these markets return to profitability 
iv nondeductible foreign expenses that incrementally affect the federal statutory rate increased the effective tax rate by approximately percent 
in  the increase related primarily to income tax adjustments in foreign markets that were non deductible for tax purposes 
some of these items may be recurring 
v changes in the deferred tax asset valuations allowance increased the effective tax rate by approximately percent in the change in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was primarily the result of reserves being established for certain foreign affiliate deferred tax assets that were not likely to be realized due to recurring losses within the respective tax jurisdictions as a net result of these and other differences  the effective tax rate for was greater than the statutory rate of percent for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources our principal use of cash is to pay for operating expenses  including volume incentives  inventory and raw material purchases  capital assets and funding of international expansion 
as of december   working capital was million  compared to million as of december  at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  of which million was held in our foreign markets and may be subject to various withholding taxes and other restrictions related to repatriation  and million in unrestricted short term investments  which were available to be used along with our normal cash flows from operations to fund any unanticipated shortfalls in future cash flows 

table of contents our net consolidated cash inflows outflows are as follows in thousands year ended december  operating activities investing activities financing activities for the year ended december   we generated cash from operating activities of million compared to million in operating cash flow improved due to the timing of payments for inventory  accounts payable and accrued liabilities  and was offset by the timing of payments for deferred revenue and income taxes payable 
in addition  our net loss included approximately million of expense net of tax  of which million was a non cash write off of cumulative translation adjustments related to our discontinued operations in brazil 
for the year ended december   we generated cash from operating activities of million  compared to million in the increase in cash generated from operating activities was primarily related to improvements in income from a net loss of million in the prior year to net income of million  as well as the decrease in our accrued liabilities related to a reduction of certain non income tax related contingencies  payments of professional fees  as well as the timing of receipts from accounts receivable and other fluctuations in other operating assets and liabilities 
capital expenditures related to the purchase of equipment  computer systems  and software for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
approximately million of cash was used during to purchase a warehouse in venezuela 
during the year ended december   we used cash to purchase available for sale investments of million and had cash proceeds of million  million and million for  and  respectively  from the sale of such investments 
we also had cash proceeds of million from the sale of restricted investments during the year ended december  during and  we used cash to pay dividends of million and million  respectively 
we suspended the payment of our quarterly cash dividends in the second quarter of in an effort to conserve cash in the united states 
we do not currently maintain a long term credit facility or any other external sources of long term funding  however  we are exploring the possibility of establishing a long term credit facility 
we believe that our working capital requirements can be met for the foreseeable future with the cash generated from our operating activities and our available cash and cash equivalents 
however  among other things  a prolonged economic downturn  a decrease in demand for our products  an unfavorable settlement of our unrecognized tax positions or non income tax contingencies could adversely affect our long term liquidity 
therefore  we believe it is prudent to explore the possibility of establishing a long term credit facility and that such funding can be established with competitive terms 
during  we had short term borrowings and repayments of million from our investment brokerage account secured by our available for sale investments in order to generate additional liquidity from month to month based upon our working capital needs 
we have the ability to borrow up to approximately percent of the fair value of our municipal obligations within our available for sale investments 
these borrowings began in and were typically repaid in the month following the initial borrowing 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes information about contractual obligations as of december  in thousands total less than year years years after years operating lease obligations purchase obligations self insurance reserves other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet unrecognized tax benefits total 
table of contents purchase obligations include non cancelable purchase agreements for both botanical and non botanical raw materials related to our forecasted production estimates  as well as related packaging materials 
the company retains a significant portion of the risks associated with certain employee medical benefits and product liability insurance 
recorded liabilities for self insured risks are calculated using actuarial methods and are not discounted 
amounts for self insurance obligations are included in accrued liabilities and long term other liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company provides a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for its officers and certain key employees 
under this plan  participants may defer up to percent of their annual salary and bonus less the participant s share of employment taxes 
the deferrals become an obligation owed to the participant by the company under the plan 
upon separation of the participant from the service of the company  the obligation owed to the participant under the plan will be paid as a lump sum or over a period of either three or five years 
as we cannot easily determine when our officers and key employees will separate from the company  we have classified the obligation greater than five years for payment 
at december   there were million of liabilities  offset by million of other assets related to unrecognized tax benefits 
because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with these liabilities  if any  the company is unable to estimate the years in which cash settlement may occur with the respective tax authorities 
the company has entered into long term agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business  in which it has agreed to pay a percentage of net sales in certain regions in which it operates  or royalties on certain products 
in  and  the aggregate amounts of these payments were million  million and million  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases 
we do not believe that these operating leases are material to our current or future financial position  results of operations  revenues or expenses  cash flows  capital expenditures or capital resources 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued amendments to the accounting and disclosure for revenue recognition 
these amendments  effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted  modify the criteria for recognizing revenue in multiple element arrangements and the scope of what constitutes a non software deliverable 
although applicable to the company  the company does not expect the adoption of these amendments to have a material impact on its financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that requires new disclosures related to fair value measurements and clarifies existing disclosure requirements about the level of disaggregation  inputs and valuation techniques 
specifically  reporting entities now must disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers 
in addition  in the reconciliation for level fair value measurements  a reporting entity should present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements 
the guidance clarifies that a reporting entity needs to use judgment in determining the appropriate classes of assets and liabilities for disclosure of fair value measurement  considering the level of disaggregated information required by other applicable us gaap guidance and should also provide disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for each class of assets and liabilities 
this guidance was effective for the company on january   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the reconciliation for level fair value measurements  which became effective for the company on january  the adoption of the applicable sections of this guidance effective on january   did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
the company does not expect sections of this guidance effective on january  to have a material impact on its financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we conduct business in several countries and intend to continue to grow our international operations 
net sales revenue  operating income and net income are affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates  interest rates and other uncertainties inherent in doing business and selling product in more than one currency 
in addition  our operations are exposed to risks associated with changes in social  political and economic conditions inherent in international operations  including changes in the laws and policies that govern international investment in countries where we have operations  as well as  to a lesser extent  changes in united states laws and regulations relating to international trade and investment 

table of contents foreign currency risk during the year ended december   approximately percent of our net sales revenue and approximately percent of our operating expenses were realized outside of the united states 
inventory purchases are transacted primarily in us dollars from vendors located in the united states 
the local currency of each international subsidiary is generally the functional currency  while certain regions  including russia and the ukraine  are served by a us subsidiary through third party entities  for which all business is conducted in us dollars 
we conduct business in twenty three different currencies with exchange rates that are not on a one to one relationship with the us dollar 
all revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the periods reported 
therefore  our operating results will be positively or negatively affected by a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar in relation to another fluctuating currency 
given the uncertainty and diversity of exchange rate fluctuations  we cannot estimate the effect of these fluctuations on our future business  product pricing  results of operations  or financial condition  but we have provided consolidated sensitivity analyses below of functional currency reporting currency exchange rate risks 
changes in various currency exchange rates affect the relative prices at which we sell our products 
we regularly monitor our foreign currency risks and periodically take measures to reduce the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results 
we do not use derivative instruments for hedging  trading or speculating on foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
additional discussion of the impact on the effect of currency fluctuations has been included in our management s discussion and analysis included in part ii  item of this report 
the following table sets forth a composite sensitivity analysis of our net sales revenue  costs and expenses and operating income in connection with strengthening of the us dollar our reporting currency by  and against every other fluctuating functional currency in which we conduct business 
we note that our individual net sales revenue  cost and expense components and our operating income were equally sensitive to increases in the strength of the us dollar against every other fluctuating currency in which we conduct business 
exchange rate sensitivity of operating income for the year ended december  dollar amounts in thousands with strengthening of us dollar by net sales revenue cost and expenses cost of goods sold volume incentives selling  general and administrative operating income as noted above  certain of our operations  including russia and the ukraine  are served by a us subsidiary through third party entities  for which all business is conducted in us dollars 
although changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the russian ruble or the ukrainian hryvnia do not result in currency fluctuations within our financial statements  a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar in relation to these other currencies can significantly affect the prices of our products and the purchasing power of our independent managers and distributors within these markets 
the following table sets forth a composite sensitivity analysis of our assets and liabilities by those balance sheet line items that are subject to exchange rate risk  together with the total gain or loss from the strengthening of the us dollar in relation to our various fluctuating functional currencies 
the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities  taken by balance sheet line items  is somewhat less than the sensitivity of our operating income to increases in the strength of the us dollar in relation to other fluctuating currencies in which we conduct business 

table of contents exchange rate sensitivity of balance sheet as of december  dollar amounts in thousands with strengthening of us dollar by loss loss loss loss loss loss financial instruments included in current assets subject to exchange rate risk cash and cash equivalents available for sale investments accounts receivable  net financial instruments included in current liabilities subject to exchange rate risk accounts payable net financial instruments subject to exchange rate risk the following table sets forth the local currencies other than the us dollar in which our assets that are subject to exchange rate risk were denominated as of december   and exceeded million upon translation into us dollars 
none of our liabilities that are denominated in a local currency other than the us dollar and that are subject to exchange rate risk exceeded million upon translation into us dollars 
we use the spot exchange rate for translating balance sheet items from local currencies into our reporting currency 
the respective spot exchange rate for each such local currency meeting the foregoing thresholds is provided in the table as well 
translation of balance sheet amounts denominated in local currency dollar amounts in thousands at spot exchange rate per translated into one us dollar as of us dollars december  cash and cash equivalents japan yen canada dollar european markets euro mexico peso colombia peso indonesia rupiah vietnam dong other varies total investments available for sale south korea won accounts receivable japan yen other varies total finally  the following table sets forth the annual weighted average of fluctuating currency exchange rates of each of the local currencies per one us dollar for each of the local currencies in which sales revenue exceeded million during any of the three years presented 
we use the annual average exchange rate for translating items from the statement of operations from local currencies into our reporting currency 

table of contents year ended december  canada dollar japan yen korea won mexico peso venezuela bolivar the local currency of the foreign subsidiaries is used as the functional currency  except for subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies or where the company s operations are served by a us based subsidiary for example russia and ukraine 
the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries  where the local currency is the functional currency  are translated into us dollars using exchange rates in effect at year end for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates during each year for the results of operations 
adjustments resulting from translation of financial statements are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of income taxes 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
the functional currency in highly inflationary economies is the us dollar and transactions denominated in the local currency are re measured as if the functional currency were the us dollar 
the re measurement of local currencies into us dollars creates translation adjustments  which are included in the consolidated statements of operations 
a country is considered to have a highly inflationary economy if it has a cumulative inflation rate of approximately percent or more over a three year period as well as other qualitative factors including historical inflation rate trends increasing and decreasing  the capital intensiveness of the operation and other pertinent economic factors 
during  venezuela was considered to be highly inflationary  as noted above 
with the exception of venezuela  there were no other countries considered to have a highly inflationary economy during  or as of january   venezuela was designated as a highly inflationary economy 
accordingly  the us dollar became the functional currency for the company s subsidiary in venezuela 
all gains and losses resulting from the re measurement of its financial statements are determined using official rates 
on january   the venezuelan government announced the devaluation of the bolivar against the us dollar 
currency restrictions enacted by the government of venezuela require approval from the government s currency control agency organization in order for the company s subsidiary in venezuela to obtain us dollars at the official exchange rate to pay for imported products or to repatriate dividends back to the company 
prior to january   the market rate  which is substantially lower than the official rate  was available to obtain us dollars or other currencies without approval of the government s currency control organization 
in  the government of venezuela enacted additional currency restrictions  which effectively replaced the market rate with the system for foreign currency denominated securities sitme  which is administered by the venezuela central bank 
under sitme  entities domiciled in venezuela can obtain us dollar denominated securities in limited quantities each month through banking institutions approved by the government 
at this time  the company is not able to estimate reasonably the future state of exchange controls in venezuela and its availability of us dollars at the official exchange rate or at the sitme rate 
however  the company has been successful to some degree in repatriating funds from venezuela for imported products using the sitme rate 
in december  the company began to apply for funds at the sitme rate and consequently began re measuring its results in venezuela at that rate  which was bolivars per us dollar as of december  as a result of the events described in the preceding paragraphs  the company recorded a gain of approximately million in connection with the re measurement of its balance sheet to reflect the highly inflationary designation and the devaluation due to the negative position of the company s venezuelan subsidiary s net monetary assets  which is recorded in foreign exchange gains or losses  a part of other income 
since the initial gain referred to above  the company s venezuelan subsidiary has recorded additional net gains of million primarily due to re measurement to the sitme rate of bolivars per us dollar from the official rate of 
the increase in the exchange rate from bolivars per us dollar to reduced the company s total reported sales by approximately percent for the year ended december  on an ongoing basis  the company does not expect future total net sales to be reduced significantly below levels 
the effect of the highly inflationary designation and the devaluation reduced reported operating income for the year ended december  by approximately million 
the success of future operations will be affected by several factors  including the company s ability to take actions to mitigate the effect of devaluation  further actions of the venezuelan government and economic conditions in venezuela  such as inflation and consumer spending 
during and  the company s venezuelan subsidiary s net sales revenue represented approximately percent and percent of consolidated net sales revenue  respectively 
the company s venezuelan subsidiary held total assets of approximately million 
table of contents and million which includes an intercompany receivable denominated in us dollars of million and million and net assets of million and million at december  and  respectively 
as of december  and  the company had approximately million and million  respectively  in cash denominated in venezuelan bolivars  of which and million  respectively  was restricted due to the local government seizing control of the bank in which this operating cash was deposited and freezing its deposits  and was classified by the company as restricted cash at december  due to the rising uncertainty in the company s ability to recover this cash  the company recorded a charge of million during the year ended december   to write off the remaining restricted cash balance  which is included in other income and expense 
the remainder of the change in restricted cash is due to the devaluation of the bolivar in interest rate risk the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
these objectives are accomplished by purchasing investment grade securities 
on december   we had investments of million of which million were municipal obligations  which carry an average fixed interest rate of percent and mature over a year period 
a hypothetical percent change in interest rates would not have had a material effect on our liquidity  financial position or results of operations
