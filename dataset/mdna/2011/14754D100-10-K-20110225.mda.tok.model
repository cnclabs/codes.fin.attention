during the second quarter of  the company renamed its internet services division as the e commerce division and realigned its operating segments into two reportable segments retail services and e commerce 
the retail services segment includes all of the operations of the company s retail services division  which is comprised of both domestic and foreign storefront locations that offer some or all of the following services pawn lending  consumer loans  check cashing and other ancillary services such as money orders  wire transfers and pre paid debit cards 
most of these ancillary services are provided through third party vendors 
the e commerce segment includes the operations of the company s e commerce division  which is composed of the company s domestic and foreign online channel and includes the company s internet lending activities  as well as online gold buying activities and other ancillary services and the company s mloc services channel 
the segment realignment was in response to a number of changing factors within the company s business 
first  the company s business strategy now emphasizes the offering of a broad array of products such as pawn loans  gold buying  and consumer loans in most retail services locations  such that the previously reported delineation of pawn and consumer loan centric locations became obsolete 
second  the company s management performance assessment  allocation of resources  and operating decisions migrated to a two segment structure with one division president overseeing retail services activities and another division president overseeing e commerce activities 
third  the company s e commerce products have expanded and now include activities such as mloc services and online gold buying 
financial information for prior years reflects the current segment structure

table of contents critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  merchandise held for disposition  allowance for losses on consumer loans  long lived and intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  empirical data and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and the related disclosures below have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors of the company 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
pawn loan fees and service charges revenue recognition 
the company accrues pawn loan fees and service charges revenue only on those pawn loans that the company deems collectible based on historical loan redemption statistics 
pawn loans written during each calendar month are aggregated and tracked for performance 
the gathering of this empirical data allows the company to analyze the characteristics of its outstanding pawn loan portfolio and estimate the probability of collection of pawn loan fees and service charges 
if the future actual performance of the loan portfolio differs significantly positively or negatively from expectations  revenue for the next reporting period would be likewise affected 
due to the short term nature of pawn loans  the company can quickly identify performance trends 
for  million  or  of recorded pawn loan fees and service charges represented cash collected from customers and the remaining million  or  represented an increase in the pawn loan fees and service charges receivable during the year 
at the end of the current year and based on the revenue recognition method described above  the company had accrued million of pawn loan fees and service charges receivable 
assuming the year end accrual of pawn loan fees and service charges revenue was overestimated or underestimated by  pawn loan fees and service charges revenue would decrease or increase by million in and net income attributable to the company would decrease or increase by million  net of taxes 
some or all of the decrease would potentially be mitigated through the profit on the disposition of the related forfeited loan collateral 
any increase would be realized as additional service charge revenue 
merchandise held for disposition 
in the company s domestic operations  merchandise held for disposition consists primarily of forfeited collateral from pawn loans not repaid and merchandise that is purchased directly from third parties or from customers 
the carrying value of the forfeited collateral and other merchandise held for disposition is stated at the lower of cost lower of cash amount loaned or market value or market 
with respect to the company s foreign pawn operations  collateral underlying unredeemed pawn loans is not owned by the company  therefore  proceeds are recorded as pawn loan fees and service charges  rather than proceeds from disposition of merchandise when the collateral is sold 
management provides an allowance for returns and valuation based on its evaluation of the merchandise and historical shrinkage rates 
because pawn loans are made without recourse to the borrower  the company does not investigate or rely upon the borrower s creditworthiness  but instead bases its lending decision on an evaluation of the pledged personal property 
the amount the company is willing to finance is typically based on a percentage of the pledged personal property s estimated disposition value 
the company uses numerous sources in determining an item s estimated disposition value  including the company s automated product valuation system as well as catalogs  blue books  newspapers  internet research and previous experience with disposing of similar items 
the company performs a physical count of its merchandise in each location on multiple occasions on a cyclical basis and reviews the composition of inventory by category and age in order to assess the adequacy of the allowance 

table of contents allowance for losses on consumer loans 
the company maintains either an allowance or accrual for losses on consumer loans including fees and interest at a level estimated to be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the outstanding combined company and third party lender portfolio the portion owned by independent third party lenders 
the allowance for losses on company owned consumer loans offsets the outstanding consumer loan amounts in the consolidated balance sheets 
active third party lender originated consumer loans in which the company does not have a participation interest are not included in the consolidated balance sheets 
an accrual for contingent losses on third party lender owned consumer loans that are guaranteed by the company is maintained and included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company aggregates and tracks consumer loans written during each calendar month to develop a performance history 
the company stratifies the outstanding combined consumer loan portfolio by age  delinquency and stage of collection when assessing the adequacy of the allowance or accrual for losses 
it uses historical collection performance adjusted for recent portfolio performance trends to develop the expected loss rates used to establish either the allowance or accrual 
increases in either the allowance or accrual are recorded as a consumer loan loss provision expense in the consolidated statements of income 
generally  the company charges off all consumer loans once they have been in default for consecutive days  or sooner if deemed uncollectible 
recoveries on losses previously charged to the allowance are credited to the allowance when collected 
the company s online lending channel periodically sells selected consumer loans that have been previously written off 
proceeds from these sales are recorded as recoveries on losses previously charged to the allowance for losses 
at december   the allowance for losses on consumer loans was million and accrued losses on third party lender owned consumer loans were million  in aggregate representing of the combined consumer loan portfolio 
for the year ended december   the consumer loan loss provision for the combined consumer loan portfolio was million and reflects of gross combined consumer loans written by the company and third party lenders 
if future loss rates increased  or decreased  by  or from levels  the consumer loan loss provision would increase  or decrease  by million and net income attributable to the company would decrease  or increase  by million  net of taxes  for  assuming the same volume of consumer loans written in income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences in recognition of income for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities and are included within the company s consolidated balance sheets 
management must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent it believes that recovery is not likely  it must establish a valuation allowance 
an expense  or benefit  is included within the tax provision in the statement of operations for any increase  or decrease  in the valuation allowance for a given period 
the company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes asc 
asc requires that a more likely than not threshold be met before the benefit of a tax position may be recognized in the consolidated financial statements and prescribes how such benefit should be measured 
management must evaluate tax positions taken on the company s tax returns for all periods that are open to examination by taxing authorities and make a judgment as to whether and to what extent such positions are more likely than not to be sustained based on merit 
management s judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
management s judgment is also required in evaluating whether tax benefits meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition under asc 
table of contents goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in each business combination 
in accordance with asc  goodwill subsequent measurement  the company tests goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life for potential impairment annually as of june and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the company s impairment evaluation of goodwill is based on comparing the fair value of the company s reporting units to their carrying value 
the fair value of the reporting units was determined based on the income approach and then compared to the results of the market approach for reasonableness 
the income approach establishes fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit  discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital developed using the capital asset pricing model  which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit 
the income approach uses the company s projections of financial performance for a five year period and includes assumptions about future revenue growth rates  operating margins and terminal growth rates which vary among reporting units 
the market approach establishes fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the reporting unit s operating performance 
the multiples are derived from other publicly traded companies that are similar but not identical from an operational and economic standpoint 
during the second quarter of  the company realigned its operating segments into two reportable segments  as further described in the general section above 
as defined in asc  segment reporting  the company has two reporting units retail services and e commerce 
these reporting units have discrete financial information which is regularly reviewed by executive management and represent the manner in which the company s operations are managed
