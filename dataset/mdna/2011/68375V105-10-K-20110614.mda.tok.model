item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion relates to our consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
statements contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are not historical facts may be forward looking statements 
such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  which could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statement 
although the information is based on our current expectations  actual results could vary from expectations stated in this report 
numerous factors will affect our actual results  some of which are beyond our control 
these include current and future economic conditions and events and their impact on us and our customers  the impact of natural events such as severe weather or earthquakes in locations in which we  our customers  our contract manufacturers or our suppliers operate  the strength of telecommunications and data communications markets  competitive market conditions  interest rate levels  volatility in our stock price  and capital market conditions 
you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this information  which speaks only as of the date of this annual report 
we assume no obligation to update publicly any forward looking information  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise  except to the extent we are required to do so in connection with our ongoing requirements under federal securities laws to disclose material information 
for a discussion of important risks related to our business  and related to investing in our securities  including risks that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from results and events referred to in the forward looking information  see item a risk factors and the discussion under the captions factors that may influence future results of operations and liquidity and capital resources below 
in light of these risks  uncertainties and assumptions  the forward looking events discussed in this report might not occur 
overview and background we were incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of hitachi  ltd  or hitachi  in september of in july of  clarity partners  lp and related investment vehicles invested in us and we became a majority owned subsidiary of hitachi 
in october  we acquired hitachi s opto device business and expanded our product line into select industrial and commercial markets 
in june  we acquired pine photonics communication inc pine and expanded our product line of sfp transceivers with data rates less than gbps that are sold to telecommunication and data communication customers 
in february  we completed our initial public offering of common stock on the nasdaq market 
on january   we completed our acquisition of stratalight communications  inc stratalight  which expanded our product line to include gbps subsystems 
we presently have sales and marketing offices in the us  europe  japan and china  which are strategically located in close proximity to our major customers 
we also have research and development facilities that are co located with each of our manufacturing facilities in the us and japan 
in addition  we use contract manufacturing partners that are located in china  japan  the philippines  taiwan  thailand and the us certain of our contract manufacturing partners that assemble or produce modules are strategically located close to our customers contract manufacturing facilities to shorten lead times and enhance flexibility 
japan earthquake and tsunami on march   the northeast coast of japan experienced a severe earthquake followed by a tsunami  with continuing aftershocks from the earthquake 
these geological events caused significant damage in the region  including severe damage to nuclear power plants  and impacted japan s power and other infrastructure as well as its economy 
our industrial and commercial production facility located in komoro  japan and our tokyo sales office were undamaged by the earthquake and operations at these facilities resumed shortly following the earthquake 
our module assembly facility in totsuka  japan suffered minor disruption from the earthquake and production at this facility was reinstated on march  while our chip production facility in totsuka also suffered minor damage  production at this facility did not fully resume until mid april  however  due to the time required to recalibrate and verify the proper operation of the equipment 
while certain of our suppliers located in japan were also impacted by the earthquake and tsunami  we were generally able to obtain alternative sources of supply or implement other measures 

table of contents we were also impacted by power outages in the totsuka area in march and april  and we are in the process of installing backup power systems to mitigate the impact of any future interruptions 
we expect these backup power systems will be operational by the end of june notwithstanding our efforts  uncertainty exists with respect to the availability of electrical power 
thus  there is a risk that we could in the future experience interruptions to our production or delays or other constraints in obtaining key components and or price increases related to such components that could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
the ten day interruption in our module manufacturing operations resulted in some loss of revenue in the fiscal quarter ended march  and we expect the continuing effects of the earthquake will impact our revenues into our fiscal quarter ending september  although the value of equipment and inventory damaged by the earthquake was minimal  we experienced approximately million of idle capacity costs in the fiscal quarter ended march  in addition  we expect to continue to experience unutilized capacity costs into our fiscal quarter ending september   though such costs will likely be less than the approximately million of idle capacity costs we experienced in the fiscal quarter ended march  acquisition of stratalight on january   we completed our acquisition of stratalight  now named opnext subsystems  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of opnext 
the aggregate consideration for such acquisition consisted of  shares of common stock and million in cash  including the impact of net purchase price adjustments pursuant to the merger agreement 
for the fiscal years ended march   and  stratalight s operations contributed revenues of million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in stratalight revenues for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  resulted from a decline in sales of gbp subsystems 
stratalight revenues have favorably impacted our gross margin percentage as sales of stratalight products generally have higher relative margins 
we also experienced incremental increases of research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses related to the stratalight operations 
during the fiscal year ended march   in connection with the acquisition of stratalight  we expensed million of in process research and development costs  and following the completion of the acquisition  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million 
sale of technology assets on february   opnext subsystems  inc opnext subsystems entered into an asset purchase agreement the purchase agreement with juniper networks  inc juniper to sell certain technology related to modem application specific integrated circuits used for long haul ultra long optical transmission to juniper for million the purchase price  million of which was paid simultaneously with the execution of the purchase agreement and million of which was paid on may  juniper has assumed all liabilities to the extent arising out of or related to the ownership  use and operation of this technology following the sale  as well as certain other liabilities relating to certain of opnext subsystem s employees to be hired by juniper 
revenues through our direct sales force supported by manufacturer representatives and distributors  we sell products to many of the leading network systems vendors throughout the americas  europe  japan and the rest of asia 
our customers include many of the top telecommunications and data communications network systems vendors in the world 
we also supply components to several major transceiver module companies and we sell to select industrial and commercial customers 
sales to telecommunication and data communication customers  our communication sales  accounted for  and of our total revenues during each of the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
also during each of the fiscal years ended march   and  sales of our communications products with gbps or lower data rates  which we refer to as our gbps and below products  represented  and of total revenues  respectively  while sales of our communications products with gbps or higher data rates  which we refer to as our gbps and above products  represented  and of total revenues  respectively 
the term sales when used herein in reference to our gbps and above products includes revenues received pursuant to development agreements 
the number of leading network systems vendors that supply the global telecommunications and data communications markets is concentrated  and so  in turn  is our customer base 
for the fiscal year ended march  
table of contents  our top three customers  alcatel lucent  cisco systems inc and subsidiaries cisco and huawei technologies co 
ltd 
huawei  accounted for in the aggregate of our consolidated revenues 
although we continue to attempt to expand our customer base  we anticipate that a small number of customers will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total revenues 
during the fiscal years ended march   and  sales attributed to the americas represented  and of total revenues  sales attributed to asia pacific excluding japan represented  and of total revenues  sales attributed to europe represented  and of total revenues  and sales attributed to japan represented  and of total revenues  respectively 
because certain sales transactions and the related assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the japanese yen  our revenues are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
for example  for the fiscal years ended march   and   and of our revenues were denominated in japanese yen  respectively 
to the extent we continue to generate a significant portion of our revenues in currencies other than the us dollar  our revenues will continue to be affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
cost of sales and gross margin our cost of sales primarily consists of materials including components that are either assembled at one of our three internal manufacturing facilities or at one of several of our contract manufacturing partners or procured from third party vendors 
because of the complexity and proprietary nature of laser manufacturing  and the advantage of having our internal manufacturing resources co located with our research and development staffs  most of the lasers used in our optical module and component products are manufactured in our facilities in komoro and totsuka  japan 
our materials include certain parts and components that are purchased from a limited number of suppliers or  in certain situations  from a single supplier 
our cost of sales also includes labor costs for employees and contract laborers engaged in the production of our components and the assembly of our finished goods  outsourcing costs  the cost and related depreciation of manufacturing equipment  as well as manufacturing overhead costs  including the costs for product warranty repairs and inventory adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory 
our cost of sales is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because a significant portion of our costs and the related assets and liabilities are denominated in japanese yen 
during the fiscal years ended march   and  approximately  and of our cost of sales were denominated in japanese yen  respectively 
the percentage decline during the fiscal year ended march  was primarily attributable to the contribution of cost of sales from the stratalight operations  which are denominated in us dollars  and our ability to procure more raw materials denominated in us dollars 
the percentage increase during the fiscal year ended march  was primarily attributable to the decline in sales from the stratalight operations as compared to the prior year 
our gross margins vary among our product lines and are generally higher on our gbps and above and longer distance gbps products 
our gross margins are also generally higher on products where we enjoy a greater degree of vertical integration with respect to the subcomponents of such products 
our overall gross margins primarily fluctuate as a result of our overall sales volumes  changes in average selling prices and product mix  the introduction of new products and subsequent generations of existing products  manufacturing yields  our ability to reduce product costs and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our gross margins are also impacted by amortization of acquired developed technology resulting from the acquisition of stratalight 
research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and benefits of personnel related to the design  development and quality testing of new products or enhancement of existing products  as well as outsourced services provided primarily by hitachi s research laboratories pursuant to our contractual agreements 
we incurred million  million and million of expenses in connection with these agreements during the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
in addition  our research and development expense includes the cost of developing prototypes and material costs associated with the testing of products prior to shipment  the cost and related depreciation of equipment used in the testing of products prior to shipment  and other contract research and development related services 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for our employees that perform our sales and related support  marketing  supply chain management  finance  legal  information technology  human resource and other general corporate functions  as well as internal and outsourced logistics and distribution costs  commissions paid to our manufacturers representatives  professional fees and other corporate related expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses also include the costs associated with pending litigation 
during the fiscal year ended march   we experienced a decrease in our selling  general and administrative expenses as we implemented certain expense reduction measures in response to the weak macroeconomic environment and as we benefitted from certain synergies associated with the integration of stratalight 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased during the fiscal year ended march   as certain temporary expense reduction measures expired 
impairment of goodwill as a result of the significant deterioration in the macroeconomic environment and the significant decrease in our market capitalization  for the fiscal year ended march   we recorded aggregate write downs of goodwill of million attributable to the previously completed acquisitions of stratalight and pine 
inventory certain of our more significant customers have implemented a supply chain management tool called vendor managed inventory vmi that requires suppliers  such as us  to assume responsibility for maintaining an agreed upon level of consigned inventory at the customer s location or at a third party logistics provider based on the customer s demand forecast 
notwithstanding the fact that we build and ship the inventory  the customer does not purchase the consigned inventory until the inventory is drawn or pulled by the customer or third party logistics provider to be used in the manufacture of the customer s product 
though the consigned inventory may be at the customer s or the third party logistics provider s physical location  it remains inventory owned by us until the inventory is drawn or pulled  which is the time at which the sale takes place 
given that under such programs we are subject to the production schedule and inventory management decisions of the customer or the third party logistics provider  our participation in vmi programs generally requires us to carry higher levels of finished goods inventory than we might otherwise carry 
as of march  and  inventories included inventory consigned to customers or their third party logistics providers pursuant to vmi arrangements of million and million  respectively 
income taxes we are subject to taxation in the united states  japan and various state  local and other foreign jurisdictions 
our us income tax returns have been examined by the internal revenue service through the fiscal year ended march  our new jersey corporate business tax returns and german tax returns have been examined by the respective tax authorities through the fiscal year ended march  our japan tax returns have been examined by the japan tax authorities through the fiscal year ended march  as of december   we experienced an ownership change as that term is defined in section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  with the result of limiting the availability of our net operating loss carryforwards and other related tax attributes nols for future use 
as a result of the ownership change  our us federal and state nols were reduced by million and million  respectively  as of december  our us federal and state nols had been previously reduced by million and million  respectively  as a result of prior acquisitions 
after giving effect to such reductions  we had us federal  state and foreign nols of million  million and million  respectively  at march  of the nols at march   million of us federal nols and million of state nols are subject to annual limitations in the amounts of million and million  respectively 

table of contents factors that may influence future results of operations global economic conditions in recent years  the credit and financial markets have experienced significant volatility characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions  increased volatility in securities and commodities prices and currency rates  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  concern over the economic stability of certain economies in europe and a significant level of intervention from the united states and other governments  as applicable 
continued concerns about the systemic impact of potential long term or widespread recession  unemployment  energy costs  geopolitical issues including government deficits  the availability and cost of credit  and reduced consumer confidence have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for most developed and emerging economies 
while recent economic data reflect some stabilization of the economy and credit markets  the cost and availability of credit may continue to reflect volatility and uncertainty 
continued turbulence in the united states and international markets and global economies could restrict our ability and the ability of our customers to refinance indebtedness  increase the costs of borrowing  limit access to capital necessary to meet liquidity needs and materially harm operations or the ability to implement planned business strategies 
with respect to our customers  these factors could also negatively impact the timing and amount of infrastructure spending  further negatively impacting our sales 
japan earthquake and tsunami the march  earthquake and tsunami in japan resulted in a ten day interruption in our manufacturing operations at our module assembly facility in totsuka  japan and an approximately five week disruption to full production at our chip production facility also located in totsuka 
certain of our suppliers located in japan were also impacted by the earthquake and tsunami  and in certain instances we had to obtain alternative sources of supply or implement other measures 
these events in japan caused significant damage to japan s power infrastructure and  during march and april  we were impacted by power outages in the totsuka area 
while we are in the process of installing backup power systems to mitigate the impact of any future interruptions  uncertainty still exists with respect to the availability of electrical power 
thus  there is a risk that we could in the future experience interruptions to our production or delays or other constraints in obtaining key components and or price increases related to such components that could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
we expect the continuing effects of the earthquake will impact our revenues into our fiscal quarter ending september  fluctuations of the japanese yen and the us dollar the japanese yen has appreciated significantly relative to the us dollar in the past several years 
for example  one us dollar approximated japanese yen on march  and japanese yen on march  our operating results are sensitive to fluctuations in the relative value of the japanese yen and us dollar because certain of our sales  costs and expenses and the related assets and liabilities are denominated in japanese yen 
as a result  fluctuations in the relative value of the japanese yen and us dollar impact both our revenues and our operating costs 
our sales denominated in japanese yen represented  and of our revenues in the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
the percentage of our cost of sales denominated in japanese yen during the fiscal years ended march   and were  and  respectively 
while we anticipate that we will continue to have a substantial portion of our cost of sales denominated in japanese yen  we expect the percentage of cost of sales denominated in japanese yen to diminish as we expand the use of contract manufacturers outside of japan and procure more raw materials in us dollars 
nonetheless  continued appreciation in the value of the japanese yen relative to the us dollar could increase our operating costs and  therefore  adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  to the extent we continue to generate a significant portion of our sales in japanese yen or other currencies  our future revenues will continue to be affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  and could be materially adversely affected 
expiration of temporary expense reduction initiatives on april   we announced certain measures intended to reduce our cost structure and operating expenses  
table of contents including  but not limited to  an approximately ten percent reduction in our global workforce  elimination of bonuses for the fiscal year ended march   a ten percent reduction in executive salaries and director cash compensation  a five percent reduction in salaries for other employees  and suspension of our matching contribution to the k plan 
in october  we further reduced our global workforce by approximately five percent 
executive salaries  director cash compensation and the salaries for other employees were reinstated to their prior levels effective april   increasing our annual cost and operating expense structure by approximately million over the reduced levels 
our matching contribution to the k plan was reinstated effective april  impact of price declines and supply constraints on revenues our revenues are affected by capital spending of our customers for telecommunications and data communications networks and for lasers and infrared leds used in select industrial and commercial markets 
the primary markets for our products continue to be characterized by increasing demand  primarily driven by increases in traditional telecommunication and data communication traffic and increasing demand for high bandwidth applications  such as video and music downloads and streaming  on line gaming  peer to peer file sharing and iptv  as well as new industrial and commercial laser applications 
the increased unit volumes as service providers deploy network systems has contributed along with intense price competition among optical component manufacturers  excess capacity  and the introduction of next generation products to the market for optical components continuing to be characterized by declining average selling prices 
in recent years  we have observed a modest acceleration in the decline of average selling prices 
we anticipate that our average selling prices will continue to decrease in future periods  although we cannot predict the extent of these decreases for any particular period 
our revenues are also impacted by our ability to procure critical component parts for our products from our suppliers 
during the last several years  the number of suppliers of component parts has decreased significantly and  more recently  demand for component parts has increased rapidly 
any supply deficiencies relating to the quality or quantities of components we use to manufacture our products can adversely affect our ability to fulfill customer orders and our results of operations 
for example  during the calendar year ended december   we experienced significant limitations on the availability of components from certain of our suppliers  resulting in losses of anticipated sales and the related revenues 
while we did not experience such component limitations in the quarter ended march   we cannot be assured that such limitations will not reoccur in the future 
effect of product life cycle on gross margins in recent periods  certain of our products that operate at gbps data rates have generated reduced gross margins  which reduced margins we believe are attributable to  among other factors  the increased average age of such products  delays in the development of certain internal subcomponents  our low level of vertical integration  as well as intensified competition in these product groups 
to the extent that we are unable to introduce  or experience delays in introducing  the next generation of these products  or to the extent we are unsuccessful in achieving a desirable level of vertical integration with respect to the subcomponents of these products  we may continue to experience diminished gross margins in connection with the sales of these products 
we experienced five consecutive quarterly declines in sales of our gbps subsystems products through the quarter ended june  although sales of these products increased in the quarter ended march  relative to the previous quarter  reoccurrence of an unfavorable sales trend in these products or other gbs and above products could negatively affect future gross margins  given that our gross margins are generally higher on these products 
research and development expense our research and development costs increased during the fiscal year ended march  relative to the prior fiscal year as a result of the full year contribution of stratalight s operations and decreased during the fiscal year ended march   as several advanced development programs transitioned to new product introduction efforts 
in the future  we expect these costs to vary with our efforts to meet the anticipated market demand for our new and planned future products and to support enhancements to our existing products 

table of contents significant accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition  warranties and allowances revenue is derived principally from the sales of our products 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists usually in the form of a purchase order  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured based on the creditworthiness of the customer and certainty of customer acceptance 
these conditions generally exist upon shipment or upon notice from certain customers in japan that they have completed their inspection and have accepted the product 
we participate in vmi programs with certain of our customers  whereby we maintain an agreed upon quantity of certain products at a customer designated warehouse 
revenue pursuant to the vmi programs is recognized when the products are physically pulled by the customer  or its designated contract manufacturer  and put into production 
simultaneous with the inventory pulls  purchase orders are received from the customer  or its designated contract manufacturer  as evidence that a purchase request and delivery have occurred and that title has passed to the customer at a previously agreed upon price 
we sell certain of our products to customers with a product warranty that provides repairs at no cost or the issuance of a credit to the customer 
the length of the warranty term depends on the product being sold  ranging from one year to five years 
in addition to accruing for specific known warranty exposures  we accrue the estimated exposure to warranty claims based upon historical claim costs as a percentage of sales multiplied by prior sales still under warranty at the end of any period 
our management reviews these estimates on a regular basis and adjusts the warranty provisions as actual experience differs from historical estimates or as other information becomes available 
allowances for doubtful accounts are based upon historical payment patterns  aging of accounts receivable and actual write off history  as well as assessments of customers creditworthiness 
changes in the financial condition of customers could have an effect on the allowance balance required and result in a related charge or credit to earnings 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
inventories consist of raw materials  work in process and finished goods  including inventory consigned to our customers and our contract manufacturers 
inventory valuation and firm committed purchase order assessments are performed on a quarterly basis and those items that are identified to be obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage are written down to their estimated realizable value 
estimates of realizable value are based upon management s analyses and assumptions  including  but not limited to  forecasted sales levels by product  expected product lifecycle  product development plans and future demand requirements 
we typically use a month rolling forecast based on factors  including  but not limited to  our production cycles  anticipated product orders  marketing forecasts  backlog  shipment activities and inventories owned by us but part of vmi programs and held at customer locations 
if market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts or actual demand from our customers is lower than our estimates  we may require additional inventory write downs 
if demand is higher than expected  inventories that had previously been written down may be sold 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at march  and  management considered recent operating results  near term earnings expectations  and the highly competitive nature of our markets in making this assessment 
at the end of each of the respective years  management determined that it was more likely than not that the full tax benefit of the deferred tax assets would not be realized 
accordingly  full valuation allowances have been provided against the net deferred tax assets 
there can be no assurance that deferred tax assets 
table of contents subject to our valuation allowance will ever be realized 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
in estimating future cash flows  assets are grouped at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of cash flows from other groups 
assumptions underlying future cash flow estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties 
our evaluations for the fiscal years ended march   and indicated that no impairments were required to be recorded 
goodwill and business combinations goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
we account for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
amounts paid for each acquisition are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition 
we then allocate the purchase price in excess of tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets based on valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management 
we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill 
we use a two step impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss to be recognized 
in the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine if the goodwill is impaired 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  then the goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then a second step is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the goodwill 
based upon the impairment analyses performed during the fiscal year ended march   we recorded aggregate goodwill impairment charges of million attributable to the acquisitions of stratalight and pine 
the company had no recorded goodwill at march   and stock based incentive plans all equity based payments  including grants of employee stock options  are recognized in our financial statements based on their grant date fair value 
we estimate the fair value of our share based awards utilizing the black scholes pricing model 
the fair value of the awards is amortized as compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the vesting period 
the fair value calculations involve significant judgments  assumptions  estimates and complexities that impact the amount of compensation expense to be recorded in current and future periods 
the factors include the time period our stock based awards are expected to remain outstanding has been determined based on the average of the original award period and the remaining vesting period in accordance with the sec s simplified method 
our expected term assumption for awards issued during the fiscal years ended march   and was years  years and years  respectively 
as additional evidence develops from our option activity  the expected term assumption may be refined to capture more relevant trends 
we estimated volatility based on our historical stock prices 
the expected volatility assumption for awards issued during the fiscal years ended march   and was  and  respectively 
a dividend yield of zero has been assumed for awards issued during the fiscal years ended march   and based on our actual past experience and the fact that we do not anticipate paying a dividend on our shares in the near future 
we have based our risk free interest rate assumption for awards issued during the fiscal years ended march   and on the implied weighted average yields of  and  respectively  available on us treasury zero coupon issues with an equivalent expected term 

table of contents forfeiture rates for awards issued during the fiscal years ended march   and have been estimated based on our actual historical forfeiture trends of approximately over their expected terms 
compensation expense for all employee stock based awards was million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the periods reported 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
these estimates include assessments of the ability to collect accounts receivable  the use and recoverability of inventory  the realization of deferred tax assets  expected warranty costs  fair value of stock awards  purchased tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in business combinations  and estimated useful lives for depreciation and amortization periods of tangible and intangible assets  among others 
actual results may differ from these estimates  and the estimates will change under different assumptions or conditions

total revenues increased million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march   including a million increase from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  partially offset by lower average selling prices 

table of contents for the fiscal year ended march   sales of our gbps and below products increased million  or  to million  while gbps and above sales increased million  or  to million and sales of our industrial and commercial products increased million  or  to million 
the increase in sales of our gbps and below products primarily resulted from increased demand for our xfp and sfp modules  partially offset by lower demand for our xenpak modules 
the increase in gbps and above sales primarily resulted from increased demand for our gbps and gbps modules partially offset by lower demand for gbps subsystems 
for the fiscal year ended march   sales to three customers  alcatel lucent  cisco and huawei  together accounted for of total revenues 
for the fiscal year ended march   sales to two customers  cisco and nokia siemens networks nsn  together accounted for of total revenues 
no other customer accounted for more than of total revenues in either such year 
gross margin 
gross margin increased million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march  gross margin for the fiscal year ended march  included a negative effect of million attributable to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  net of the impact from foreign currency exchange forward contracts 
for the fiscal years ended march  and  we incurred million of amortization of acquired developed technology associated with the stratalight acquisition  and for the fiscal year ended march   we incurred million of charges attributable to a purchase price accounting adjustment for inventory and million of employee liquidity bonus plan expense  each associated with the stratalight acquisition 
during the fiscal years ended march  and  gross margin included charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million and million  respectively 
as a percentage of revenue  gross margin increased to for the fiscal year ended march  from for the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily attributable to reduced charges associated with the stratalight acquisition  reduced charges for excess and obsolete inventory and provision for warranty  partially offset by lower average selling prices and an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and hedging programs 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march   notwithstanding a million increase attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
research and development expenses decreased as a percentage of sales to for the fiscal year ended march  from for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in research and development expenses was primarily the result of the elimination of employee liquidity bonus plan expense associated with the acquisition of stratalight and reduced outsourcing services provided primarily by hitachi s research laboratories and other outsourcing service providers 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march   including a million increase attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of sales to for the fiscal year ended march  from for the fiscal year ended march  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was principally attributable to employee expenses  including severance costs  restoration of executive and other employee salaries to prior levels upon expiration of the expense reduction measures in effect during the fiscal year ended march   stock based expenses associated with the departure of the company s chief executive officer  as well as unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
amortization of purchased intangibles

as part of the annual assessment of goodwill completed during the quarter ended march   there were significant indicators to conclude that an impairment of the goodwill associated with the acquisition of stratalight on january  may have occurred 
this conclusion was based on the significant decrease in our market capitalization and a significant deterioration in the macroeconomic environment from the time of the acquisition announcement on july  through march  we concluded in the impairment analysis that the carrying value of the goodwill associated with the stratalight acquisition exceeded its fair value 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the quarter ended march   which represented the full amount of goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition 
during the quarter ended december   there were sufficient indicators to require an interim goodwill impairment analysis  including a significant decrease in our market capitalization and a significant deterioration in the macroeconomic environment largely caused by the widespread unavailability of business and consumer credit

during the fiscal year ended march   we also entered into million of new capital lease obligations 
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalent balances will be sufficient to fund our anticipated cash needs at least for the next twelve months 
however  we may require additional financing to fund our operations in the future and there can be no assurance that additional funds will be available  especially if we experience operating results below expectations  or  if available  there can be no assurance as to the terms on which funds might be available 
in addition  unprecedented volatility in recent years in the global credit markets may affect the availability and cost of funding in the future 
if adequate financing is not available as required  or is not available on favorable terms  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 
contractual obligations during the fiscal year ended march   we entered into million of new capital lease obligations

in certain instances  these agreements allow us the option to cancel  reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk consists of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international 
table of contents sales and operations and changes in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents and short term debt 
to the extent we generate sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  our revenues will be affected by currency fluctuations 
for the fiscal years ended march   and   and  respectively  of our sales were denominated in japanese yen and or less were denominated in euros 
the remaining sales were denominated in us dollars 
to the extent we manufacture our products in japan  our cost of sales will be affected by currency fluctuations 
during the fiscal years ended march   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our cost of sales was denominated in japanese yen 
while we anticipate that we will continue to have a substantial portion of our cost of sales denominated in japanese yen  we anticipate the percentage of cost of sales denominated in japanese yen to diminish as we plan to expand the use of contract manufacturers outside of japan and procure more raw materials in us dollars 
to the extent we perform research and development activities and selling  general and administrative functions in japan  our operating expenses will be affected by currency fluctuations 
during the fiscal years ended march   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our operating expenses were denominated in japanese yen 
we anticipate that we will continue to have a substantial portion of our operating expenses denominated in japanese yen in the foreseeable future 
to the extent that our sales  cost of sales and operating expenses are denominated in japanese yen  our operating results will be subject to fluctuations due to changes in the relative value of the japanese yen and the us dollar 
if the exchange rate of the japanese yen in relation to the us dollar had appreciated by ten percent during the fiscal year ended march   our operating loss would have increased by approximately million 
if the exchange rate had depreciated by ten percent during the fiscal year ended march   our operating loss would have been reduced by approximately million 
as of march   we had a net payable position of million and as of march   we had a net receivable position of million subject to foreign currency exchange risk between the japanese yen and the us dollar 
we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange fluctuations on intercompany sales transactions involving the japanese yen and the us dollar 
at march   we had three foreign currency exchange contracts in place with an aggregate nominal value of million and expiration dates of days or less to hedge a portion of this risk 
at march   we had six foreign currency exchange contracts in place with an aggregate nominal value of million and expiration dates of days or less 
we do not enter into foreign currency exchange forward contracts for trading purposes  but rather as a hedging vehicle to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
if the foreign currency exchange forward contracts were to be held to maturity and the exchange rate of the japanese yen in relation to the us dollar were to depreciate by ten percent from the closing spot rate on march  to the maturity date  we would realize an approximate gain at maturity of million 
if the yen were to appreciate by ten percent  we would realize an approximate loss at maturity of million 
we have entered into a short term  yen denominated loan with the sumitomo trust bank  which is due monthly unless renewed 
at march  and  the loan balance was million and million  respectively 
during the fiscal year ended march   payments of million yen were made  reducing the yen balance from billion yen at march  to billion yen at march  interest is paid monthly at tibor plus a premium that ranged from to  to and to during the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
to the extent we maintain significant cash balances in money market accounts  our interest income will be affected by interest rate fluctuations 
as of march  and  we had million and million  respectively  of cash balances invested primarily in traded institutional money market funds or money market deposit accounts at banking institutions 
interest income earned on these accounts was million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively
