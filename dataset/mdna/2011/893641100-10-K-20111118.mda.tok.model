item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected financial data and td group s consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion may contain predictions  estimates and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties  including those discussed under the heading entitled risk factors included elsewhere in this report 
these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 
overview we believe we are a leading global designer  producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today 
our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers 
some of our more significant product offerings  substantially all of which are ultimately provided to end users in the aerospace industry  include mechanical electro mechanical actuators and controls  ignition systems and engine technology  specialized pumps and valves  power conditioning devices  specialized ac dc electric motors and generators  nicad batteries and chargers  engineered latching and locking devices  rods and locking devices  engineered connectors and elastomers  cockpit security components and systems  specialized cockpit displays  aircraft audio systems  specialized lavatory components  engineered interior surfaces and lighting and control technology 
each of these product offerings is composed of many individual products that are typically customized to meet the needs of a particular aircraft platform or customer 
long term sustainable growth for fiscal year  we generated net sales of  million  gross profit of million or of sales  and net income of million 
we believe we have achieved steady  long term growth in sales and improvements in operating performance since our formation in due to our competitive strengths and through execution of our value driven operating strategy 
more specifically  focusing our businesses on our value driven operating strategy of obtaining profitable new business  carefully controlling the cost structure and pricing our highly engineered value added products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so has historically resulted in improvements in gross profit and income from operations over the long term 
our selective acquisition strategy has also contributed to the growth of our business 
the integration of certain acquisitions into our existing businesses combined with implementing our proven operating strategy has historically resulted in improvements of the financial performance of the acquired business 
our key competitive strengths and the elements of our business strategy are set forth in more detail below 
we believe our key competitive strengths include large and growing installed product base with aftermarket revenue stream 
we provide components to a large and growing installed base of aircraft to which we supply aftermarket products 
we estimate that our products are installed on approximately  commercial transport  regional transport  military and general aviation fixed wing turbine aircraft and rotary wing aircraft 
diversified revenue base 
we believe that our diversified revenue base reduces our dependence on any particular product  platform or market channel and has been a significant factor in maintaining our financial performance 
our products are installed on almost all of the major commercial aircraft platforms now in production 
we expect to continue to develop new products for military and commercial applications 

table of contents significant barriers to entry 
we believe that the niche nature of our markets  the industry s stringent regulatory and certification requirements  the large number of products that we sell and the investments necessary to develop and certify products create barriers to entry for potential competitors 
our business strategy is made up of two key elements a value driven operating strategy focused around our three core value drivers and a selective acquisition strategy 
value driven operating strategy 
our three core value drivers are obtaining profitable new business 
we attempt to obtain profitable new business by using our technical expertise  application skill and our detailed knowledge of our customer base and the individual niche markets in which we operate 
we have regularly been successful in identifying and developing both aftermarket and oem products to drive our growth 
improving our cost structure 
we are committed to maintaining and continuously improving our lean cost structure through detailed attention to the cost of each of the products that we offer and our organizational structure  with a focus on reducing the cost of each 
providing highly engineered value added products to customers 
we focus on the engineering  manufacturing and marketing of a broad range of highly engineered niche products that we believe provide value to our customers 
we believe we have been consistently successful in communicating to our customers the value of our products 
this has generally enabled us to price our products to fairly reflect the value we provide and the resources required to do so 
selective acquisition strategy 
we selectively pursue the acquisition of proprietary aerospace component businesses when we see an opportunity to create value through the application of our three core value driven operating strategies 
the aerospace industry  in particular  remains highly fragmented  with many of the companies in the industry being small private businesses or small non core operations of larger businesses 
we have significant experience among our management team in executing acquisitions and integrating acquired businesses into our company and culture 
as of the date of this report  we have successfully acquired and integrated businesses and or product lines since our formation in many of these acquisitions have been integrated into an existing transdigm production facility  which enables a higher production capacity utilization  which in turn improves gross profit levels due to the ability to spread the fixed manufacturing overhead costs over higher production volume

trend information we predominantly serve customers in the commercial  regional  business jet and general aviation aftermarket  which accounts for approximately of total sales  the commercial aerospace oem market  comprising large commercial transport manufacturers and regional and business jet manufacturers  which accounts for approximately of total sales  and the defense market  which accounts for approximately of total sales 
non aerospace sales comprise approximately of our total sales 
the commercial aerospace industry  including the aftermarket and oem market  is impacted by the health of the global economy and geo political events around the world 
the commercial aerospace industry had shown strength with increases in revenue passenger miles  or rpms  between and  as well as increases in oem production and backlog  however  in  the global economic downturn negatively impacted the commercial aerospace industry causing rpms to decline slightly 
this market sector began to rebound in and continued to grow in with increases in rpms  as well as the growth in the large commercial oem sector aircraft with or more seats with order announcements by the boeing company and airbus sas leading to planned increases in production 
the leading indicators and industry consensus suggest the continuation of current trends in the commercial transport market sector supported by continued rpm growth  a modest acceleration of capacity growth and increases in production at the oem level 
the defense aerospace market is dependent on government budget constraints  the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts 
it is not necessarily affected by general economic conditions that affect the commercial aerospace industry 
our presence in both the commercial aerospace and military sectors of the aerospace industry may mitigate the impact on our business of any specific industry risk 
we service a diversified customer base in the commercial and military aerospace industry  and we provide components to a diverse installed base of aircraft  which mitigates our exposure to any individual airframe platform 
at times  declines in sales in one channel have been offset by increased sales in another 
however  due to differences between the profitability of our products sold to oem and aftermarket customers  variation in product mix can cause variation in gross margin 
there are many short term factors including inventory corrections  unannounced changes in order patterns  strikes and mergers and acquisitions that can cause short term disruptions in our quarterly shipment patterns as compared to previous quarters and the same periods in prior years 
to normalize for short term fluctuations  we tend to look at our performance over several quarters or years of activity rather than discrete short term periods 
as such  it can be difficult to determine longer term trends in our business based on quarterly comparisons 
there are also fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering and delivery requests from quarter to quarter  as well as variations in product mix from quarter to quarter  that may cause positive or negative variations in 
table of contents gross profit margins since commercial aftermarket sales have historically produced a higher gross margin than sales to commercial oems 
again  in many instances these are timing events between quarters and must be balanced with macro aerospace industry indicators 
commercial aftermarket the key growth factors in the commercial aftermarket include worldwide rpms and the size and activity level of the worldwide fleet of aircraft 
although rpms increased annually between and  had negative growth as a result of reductions in air traffic and capacity due to the slowdown in the global economy 
worldwide rpms returned to positive growth in and and current industry consensus indicates that rpm growth will continue in commercial oem market conditions in the commercial transport market sector improved during we are now expecting increased sales in the large commercial oem sector aircraft with or more seats driven by order announcements by the boeing company and airbus sas furthermore  the business jet oem market significantly declined between and however  the business jet oem market has started to recover in and is expected to continue to show positive growth in this market has been negatively impacted by the slowdown in economic growth  corporate profits  commodity prices and stock market returns across the world 
defense in recent years  defense spending has reached historic highs  due in part to the military engagements in afghanistan and iraq and the war on terrorism 
our military business fluctuates from year to year  and is dependent  to a degree  on government budget constraints  the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts 
we anticipate that military related sales of our types of products could be flat to modestly down in future years over the current high levels 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap  which often requires the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods 
management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations 
however  investors are cautioned that the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods  assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we have identified the following as the most critical accounting policies upon which our financial status depends 
these critical policies were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
our most critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition and related allowances revenue is recognized from the sale of products when title and risk of loss passes to the customer  which is generally at the time of shipment 
substantially all sales are made pursuant to firm  fixed price purchase orders received from customers 
collectability of amounts recorded as revenue is reasonably assured at the time of sale 
provisions for returns  uncollectible accounts and the cost of repairs under contract warranty provisions are provided for in the same period as the related revenues are recorded and are principally based on historical results modified  as appropriate  by the most current information available 
we have a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of such allowances  however  due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  it is possible that actual results may vary from the estimates and the differences could be material 

table of contents management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of the accounts receivable and customer creditworthiness 
the allowance also incorporates a provision for the estimated impact of disputes with customers 
management s estimate of the allowance amounts that are necessary includes amounts for specifically identified credit losses and a general amount for estimated credit losses based on historical information 
the determination of the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is subject to significant levels of judgment and estimation by management 
depending on the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues  or if the financial condition of any of the company s customers were to deteriorate and their ability to make required payments were to become impaired  increases in these allowances may be required 
historically  changes in estimates in the allowance for doubtful accounts have not been significant 
the company provides limited warranties in connection with the sale of its products 
the warranty period for products sold  which varies among the company s operations  is typically less than two years but can be in the range from days to six years 
in addition  certain contracts with distributors contain right of return provisions 
the company accrues for estimated returns and warranty claims based on knowledge of product performance issues and based on excess inventories provided by its customers and industry sources 
the company also provides a general amount based on historical trends 
to the extent total warranty claims differ from estimates  adjustments may be necessary 
historically  actual product returns and warranty claims have not differed materially from the estimates originally established 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost of inventories is determined by the average cost and the first in  first out fifo methods for all locations except cef industries  llc  which determines the cost of inventories using the last in  first out lifo method 
because the company sells products that are installed on airframes that can be in service for or more years  it must keep a supply of such products on hand while the airframes are in use 
where management estimated that the current market value was below cost or determined that future demand was lower than current inventory levels  based on historical experience  current and projected market demand  current and projected volume trends and other relevant current and projected factors associated with the current economic conditions  a reduction in inventory cost to estimated net realizable value was made by recording a provision included in cost of sales 
although management believes that the company s estimates of excess and obsolete inventory are reasonable  actual results may differ materially from the estimates and additional provisions may be required in the future 
in addition  in accordance with industry practice  all inventories are classified as current assets as all inventories are available and necessary to support current sales  even though a portion of the inventories may not be sold within one year 
historically  changes in estimates in the net realizable value of inventories have not been significant 
intangible assets mergers and acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method and have resulted in significant amounts of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill 
fair value adjustments to the company s assets and liabilities are recognized and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in our consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the merger or acquisition 
we generally use third party appraisals to assist us in determining the estimated fair value of the intangible assets 
intangible assets other than goodwill are recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed or exchanged  regardless of the company s intent to do so 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value on the date of acquisition and are reviewed at least annually for impairment based on cash flow projections and fair value estimates 
gaap requires that the annual  and any interim  impairment assessment be performed at the reporting unit level 
the reporting unit level is the operating subsidiary level for the company 
substantially all goodwill was determined and recognized for each operating subsidiary pursuant to the accounting for the merger or acquisition as of the date of each transaction  and therefore the allocation of goodwill among reporting units was immaterial for purposes of the impairment assessment 
with respect to acquisitions integrated into an existing operating subsidiary  any related goodwill is combined with goodwill of the operating subsidiary 

table of contents at the time of goodwill impairment testing  management determines the estimated fair value through the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit 
if the calculated estimated fair value is less than the current carrying value  impairment of goodwill of the reporting unit may exist 
the use of a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine estimated fair value is common practice in impairment testing 
the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model for impairment testing includes discount rates  growth rates  cash flow projections and terminal value rates 
discount rates are set by using the weighted average cost of capital wacc methodology 
the wacc methodology considers market and industry data as well as company specific risk factors for each reporting unit in determining the appropriate discount rates to be used 
the discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business 
operational management  considering industry and company specific historical and projected data  develops growth rates  sales projections and cash flow projections for each reporting unit 
terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual cash flow estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low long term growth rates 
as an indicator that each reporting unit has been valued appropriately through the use of the discounted cash flow valuation model  the aggregate of all reporting units estimated fair value is reconciled to the total market capitalization of the company 
the company had reporting units with goodwill as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal  the date of the last annual impairment test 
the estimated fair values of each of the reporting units was substantially in excess of their respective carrying values by more than percent  and therefore no goodwill impairment was recorded 
the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate  which is a significant assumption in the calculation of fair values 
with a one percentage point increase in the discount rate  the reporting units would continue to have fair values in excess of their respective carrying values 
management tests indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at the asset level  as determined by appropriate asset valuation at the time of acquisition 
the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison between the estimated fair values and carrying values 
if the carrying amounts of intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives exceed their estimated fair values  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
management utilizes the royalty savings valuation method to determine the estimated fair value for each indefinite lived intangible asset 
in this method  management estimates the royalty savings arising from the ownership of the intangible asset 
the key assumptions used in estimating the royalty savings for impairment testing include discount rates  royalty rates  growth rates  sales projections and terminal value rates 
discount rates used are similar to the rates developed by the wacc methodology considering any differences in company specific risk factors between reporting units and the indefinite lived intangible assets 
royalty rates are established by management with the advice of valuation experts and periodically substantiated by valuation experts 
operational management  considering industry and company specific historical and projected data  develops growth rates and sales projections for each significant intangible asset 
terminal value rate determination follows common methodology of capturing the present value of perpetual sales estimates beyond the last projected period assuming a constant wacc and low long term growth rates 
the discounted cash flow and royalty savings valuation methodologies require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the valuations are performed 
actual results could differ from these assumptions 
management believes the assumptions used are reflective of what a market participant would have used in calculating fair value considering the current economic conditions 
stock options the company accounts for the cost of its stock options in accordance with gaap  which requires the measurement of compensation expense under the stock option plan to be based on the estimated fair value of the awards under the plan on the grant dates and amortizes the expense over the vesting periods of the options 
the company estimates the fair value of all share based payments using the black scholes merton option pricing model which requires management to make certain assumptions 
management continuously reviews the 
table of contents following assumptions risk free interest rates  expected life of options  expected volatility of stock and expected dividend yield of stock 
an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside management s control could have an impact on the company s results of operations 
environmental matters the company is involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of its currently and formerly owned sites and at third party sites 
the company accrues for environmental related activities for which commitments or clean up plans have been developed and for which costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment 
all accrued amounts were recorded on an undiscounted basis 
environmental related expenses include costs of investigation and remediation and fees paid to outside engineering  actuarial  consulting and law firms 
due to uncertainties surrounding environmental investigations and remediation activities  the company s ultimate liability may result in costs that are significantly higher than currently accrued 
income taxes the company estimates income taxes in each jurisdiction in which it operates 
this involves estimating taxable earnings  specific taxable and deductible items  the likelihood of generating sufficient future taxable income to utilize deferred tax assets and possible exposures related to future tax audits 
to the extent these estimates change  adjustments to deferred and accrued income taxes are made in the period in which the changes occur 
historically  such adjustments have not been significant 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain operating data of the company  including presentation of the amounts as a percentage of net sales amounts in thousands fiscal years ended september  of sales of sales of sales net sales cost of sales selling and administrative expenses amortization of intangible assets income from operations refinancing costs interest expense  net income tax provision income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations  net of tax net income fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to  million for fiscal from million for fiscal sales of million  or  resulted from the acquisitions of dukes aerospace and semco instruments in fiscal and mckechnie aerospace  talley actuation and schneller holdings in fiscal organic sales increased by million or from the prior year 
the organic sales growth was primarily due to an increase of million  or a increase in commercial oem sales  and an increase of million  or a increase in commercial aftermarket sales  resulting primarily from improving market demand for commercial aftermarket products 
defense sales increased by million for fiscal compared to fiscal 
table of contents cost of sales and gross profit 
cost of sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in the dollar amount of cost of sales was primarily due to increased volume associated with the net sales from acquisitions and the organic sales growth discussed above  along with an increase in inventory purchase accounting adjustments and acquisition integration costs 
gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the dollar amount of gross profit increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in the amount of gross profit was primarily due to the following items sales of million from the acquisitions indicated above contributed gross profit of approximately million for fiscal  which includes the acquisition related costs inventory purchase accounting adjustments and acquisition integration costs incurred in connection with those acquisitions amounting to million 
these acquisitions diluted gross profit as a percentage of sales for fiscal by approximately percentage points 
organic sales growth described above  favorable product mix and favorable product pricing on our proprietary products resulted in increased gross profit of approximately million for fiscal selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased by million to million  or of sales  for fiscal from million  or of sales  for the fiscal the increase is primarily due to higher selling and administrative expenses relating to recent acquisitions of approximately million and non cash stock compensation expense of approximately million 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the net increase of million was primarily due to amortization expense related to the additional identifiable intangible assets recognized in connection with acquisitions during the last twelve months 
refinancing costs 
refinancing costs were recorded as a result of the refinancing of transdigm s entire debt structure in december the charge of million consisted of the premium of million paid to redeem our senior subordinated notes  the write off of debt issue costs and unamortized note premium and discount of million  and the settlement of the interest rate swap agreement and other expenses of million 
interest expense net 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the net increase in interest expense net was primarily due to an increase in the weighted average level of outstanding borrowings  which was approximately billion for fiscal and approximately billion for fiscal the increase in borrowings was due to the debt refinancing transactions and the acquisition financing related to mckechnie aerospace which occurred in december the weighted average interest rate on total borrowings outstanding at september  was approximately 
income taxes 
income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was approximately for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to non recurring adjustments in estimated deferred state obligations and an increase in research and development tax credits 
income from discontinued operations 
income from discontinued operations comprises the net loss from discontinued operations through the dates of sale of the fastener business and aqs of million and the after tax net gain on sales of million recorded during fiscal net income 
net income increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to net income of million for fiscal  primarily as a result of the factors referred to above 

table of contents earnings per share 
the basic and diluted earnings per share were for fiscal and per share for fiscal for fiscal  basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were and basic and diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations were 
net income for fiscal of million was decreased by an allocation of dividends to participating securities of million resulting in net income available to shareholders of million 
due to the special cash dividend declared and paid during fiscal  the net income for fiscal of million was reduced by an allocation of dividends to participating securities of million resulting in net income applicable to common shareholders of million 
fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal sales of million resulted from the acquisitions of aircraft parts corporation  acme and the woodward hrt product line in fiscal as well as the recent acquisitions of dukes aerospace and semco in fiscal sales excluding acquisitions declined by million  or  from the prior year 
the decline in organic sales was primarily due to a decrease of million  or a decrease in commercial oem sales resulting primarily from the business jet oem s significant production rate reductions and related inventory reductions resulting from the impact of the global economic conditions 
partially offsetting the decline in organic commercial oem sales was i an increase of million in commercial aftermarket sales due to the apparent beginning of a long awaited upturn in global air traffic  and ii an increase of million in defense sales primarily due to increased demand for oem products across most of our product lines 
cost of sales and gross profit 
cost of sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in the dollar amount of cost of sales was primarily due to increased volume associated with the higher net sales discussed above 
in addition  the increase was partially attributable to higher costs incurred to integrate acquired businesses into td group s operations and purchase accounting adjustments to inventory that were charged to cost of sales of million 
gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the dollar amount of gross profit increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal the increase in the amount of gross profit was primarily due to the following items sales of million from the acquisitions indicated above contributed gross profit of approximately million in fiscal  which includes the acquisition related costs inventory purchase accounting adjustments and acquisition integration costs incurred in connection with those acquisitions amounting to million 
these acquisitions diluted gross profit as a percentage of sales for fiscal by approximately percentage points 
favorable product mix  favorable product pricing on our proprietary products and cost reduction efforts partially offset by the negative impact of fixed overhead costs spread over lower production volume excluding acquisitions 
the net impact of these items resulted in increased gross profit of approximately million in fiscal despite the decline in organic sales of million discussed above 
selling and administrative expenses
