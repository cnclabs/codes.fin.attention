risk factors 
dollars in millions our business faces many risks 
we believe the risks described below outline the items of most concern to us 
however  these are not the only risks we face 
economic conditions the deterioration in economic conditions that began in affected our business in several ways 
elevated unemployment  the tightening of consumer credit and the decline in the housing and stock markets in the united states all contributed to a reduction in consumer spending  which in turn had a negative impact on our revenues 
we sell high quality apparel  shoes  cosmetics and accessories  which many consumers consider to be discretionary items 
during economic downturns  fewer customers may shop in our stores and on our website  and those who do shop may limit the amount of their purchases  all of which may lead to lower sales  higher markdowns and increased marketing and promotional spending in response to lower demand 
the deterioration of economic conditions also adversely affected our credit customers payment patterns and delinquency rates  increasing our bad debt expense 
our business has improved and some macroeconomic indicators suggest that a modest economic recovery has begun  however key factors such as employment levels  consumer credit and housing market conditions remain weak 
a sluggish economic recovery or a renewed downturn could have a significant adverse effect on our business 
in addition  many states where we conduct business are facing significant budget shortfalls as a result of the economic downturn  and may seek to address those shortfalls through unfavorable changes in tax laws and interpretation of existing laws 
an increase in our tax liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations 
impact of competitive market forces the fashion specialty retail industry is highly competitive 
we compete with other national  regional and local retail establishments that may carry similar lines of merchandise  including department stores  specialty stores  boutiques and internet businesses 
if we are unable to remain competitive in the key areas of customer service  fashion newness  quality of products  the shopping experience across all channels  depth of selection  store environment and location  we may lose market share to our competitors and our sales and profitability could suffer 
our credit segment faces competition from large banks and other credit card companies  some of which have substantial financial resources 
many of our competitors offer general purpose credit card products with a variety of loyalty programs 
in addition  there is intense competition for cardholders with prime credit ratings who make up a significant portion of our credit portfolio 
if we do not effectively respond to the competitive banking and credit card environment  we could lose market share to our competitors  which would have an adverse effect on our credit business 
availability and cost of merchandise our relationships with our merchandise vendors have been a significant contributor to our success and our position as a retailer of high quality fashion merchandise 
we have no guaranteed supply arrangements with our key vendors  many of whom limit the number of retail channels they use to sell their merchandise 
competition to obtain and sell this merchandise is intense 
nearly all of the brands of our top vendors are sold by competing retailers  and many of our top vendors also have their own dedicated retail stores 
if one or more of our top vendors were to limit or reduce our access to their merchandise  our business could be adversely affected 
further  if our merchandise costs increase due to increased raw material or labor costs or other factors  our ability to respond or the effect of our response could adversely affect our sales or gross margins 
ability to respond to consumer preferences and fashion trends we strive to ensure the merchandise we offer and our shopping experience remain current and compelling to our customers 
we make decisions regarding inventory purchases well in advance of the season in which it will be sold 
therefore  our ability to predict or respond to changes in fashion trends  consumer preferences and spending patterns  and to match our merchandise levels  mix and shopping experience to sales trends and consumer tastes  significantly impacts our sales and operating results 
if we do not identify and respond to emerging trends in consumer spending and preferences quickly enough  we may harm our ability to retain our existing customers or attract new customers 
if we purchase too much inventory  we may be forced to sell our merchandise at higher average markdown levels and lower average margins  which could harm our business 
conversely  if we fail to purchase enough merchandise  we may lose opportunities for additional sales and damage our relationships with our customers 
growth strategy our strategic growth plan includes opening new nordstrom full line and nordstrom rack stores  with announced nordstrom full line and announced nordstrom rack store openings  the majority of which will occur by the availability and cost of suitable locations for our stores depends on a number of factors  including competition from other retailers and businesses  local land use and other regulations  new shopping center construction and developers financial condition 
new store openings also involve certain risks  including constructing  furnishing and supplying a store in a timely and cost effective manner and accurately assessing the demographic or retail environment for a particular location 
our sales at new  relocated or remodeled stores may not meet our projections  which could adversely affect our return on investment 
we are also pursuing other growth opportunities  which may include acquisitions of  or investments in  other businesses  as well as new technologies or other investments to improve the customer shopping experience in our stores and online 
if these investments do not perform as expected  our profitability and growth could be adversely affected 

table of contents leadership development and succession planning the training and development of our future leaders is important to our long term success 
if we do not effectively implement our strategic and business planning processes to attract  retain  train and develop future leaders  our business may suffer 
we rely on the experience of our senior management  who have specific knowledge relating to us and our industry that is difficult to replace 
if unexpected leadership turnover occurs without adequate succession plans  the loss of the services of any of these individuals  or any negative perceptions of our business as a result of those losses  could damage our brand image and our business 
merchandise planning we are making investments to improve our multi channel merchandise planning  procurement and allocation capabilities 
these efforts involve changes in personnel  processes and technology over a period of several years 
if we encounter challenges associated with change management  the ability to hire and retain key personnel involved in these efforts  implementation of associated information technology or adoption of new processes  our ability to continue to successfully execute our strategy could be adversely affected 
as a result  we may not derive the expected benefits to our sales and profitability  or we may incur increased costs relative to our current projections 
financial system reforms the recent financial crisis resulted in increased legislative and regulatory changes affecting the financial industry 
the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of the credit card act included new rules and restrictions on credit card pricing  finance charges and fees  customer billing practices and payment application 
these rules required us to make changes to our credit card business practices and systems  and we expect more regulations and interpretations of the new rules to emerge 
depending on the nature and extent of the full impact from these rules  and any interpretations or additional rules  the revenues and profitability of our credit segment could be adversely affected 
in addition  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act was enacted in july it significantly restructures regulatory oversight and other aspects of the financial industry  creates a new federal agency to supervise and enforce consumer lending laws and regulations and expands state authority over consumer lending 
numerous regulations will be issued in the near future to implement the requirements of this act 
the final regulatory details remain uncertain at this time 
depending on the nature and extent of these regulations  and the enforcement approach of regulators under the new law  there could be an adverse impact to our credit segment 
information security and privacy the protection of our customer  employee and company data is important to us 
our customers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information 
in addition  the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding  with new and constantly changing requirements across our business units 
a significant breach of customer  employee or company data could damage our reputation  our brand and our relationship with our customers and result in lost sales  fines and lawsuits 
in addition  a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to our information security systems and could result in disruption of our operations 
consumer credit our credit card operations help drive sales in our stores  allow our stores to avoid third party transaction fees and generate additional revenues from extending credit 
our credit card revenues and profitability are subject in large part to economic and market conditions that are beyond our control  including  but not limited to  interest rates  consumer credit availability  consumer debt levels  unemployment trends  laws and regulations and other factors 
elevated levels of unemployment have historically corresponded with increased credit card delinquencies and write offs  which may continue in the future 
further  these economic conditions could impair our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers if the criteria and or models we use to underwrite and manage our customers become less predictive of future losses 
this could cause our losses to rise and have a negative impact on our results of operations 
capital management and liquidity our access to debt and equity capital  and our ability to invest capital to maximize the total returns to our shareholders  is critical to our long term success 
we utilize capital to finance our operations  make capital expenditures and acquisitions  manage our debt levels and return value to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases 
our ability to obtain capital and the cost of the capital depend on company performance  financial market conditions and independent rating agencies short and long term debt ratings  which are based largely on our performance as measured by credit metrics including interest coverage and leverage ratios 
if our access to capital is restricted or if our cost of capital increases  our operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
further  if we do not properly allocate our capital to maximize returns  our operations  cash flows and returns to shareholders could be adversely affected 
brand and reputation we have a well recognized brand that consumers may associate with a high level of customer service and quality merchandise 
any significant damage to our brand or reputation could negatively impact sales  reduce employee morale and productivity and diminish customer trust  any of which would harm our business 
nordstrom  inc and subsidiaries 
table of contents information technology strategy we make investments in information technology to sustain our competitive position 
in  we expect to spend approximately on information technology operations and systems development  which is key to our growth 
we must monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace 
excessive technological change could impact the effectiveness of adoption  and could make it more difficult for us to realize benefits from the technology 
targeting the wrong opportunities  failing to make the best investments or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs may result in the loss of our competitive position 
in addition  if we do not maintain our current systems we may see interruptions to our business and increase our costs in order to bring our systems up to date 
health care reform in march  the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of the health care reform acts were signed into law 
these laws include numerous health care related provisions which will take effect over a four year period beginning in increased costs required to meet the requirements of the health care reform acts and any interpretations or additional rules resulting from the acts could adversely affect our profitability 
in addition  if it is necessary to make changes to the health benefits provided to our employees as a result of the health care reform acts  we may not be able to offer competitive health care benefits to attract and retain employees 
laws  regulations and litigation our policies  procedures and practices are designed to comply with federal  state  local and foreign laws  rules and regulations  including those imposed by the sec  nyse  the banking industry and foreign countries  which may change from time to time 
these laws and regulations are complex  continuously evolving and the related enforcement is increasingly aggressive  particularly in the state of california  which has increased the cost of compliance 
significant legislative changes  including those that relate to employment matters  could impact our relationship with our workforce  which could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations 
possible legislative changes include changes to an employer s obligation to recognize collective bargaining units 
in addition  if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to damage to our reputation  class action lawsuits  legal and settlement costs  civil and criminal liability  increased cost of regulatory compliance  restatements of our financial statements  disruption of our business and loss of customers 
any required changes to our employment practices could result in the loss of employees  reduced sales  increased employment costs  low employee morale and harm to our business and results of operations 
in addition  we are regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business 
litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect our business and financial condition 
business continuity our business and operations could be materially and adversely affected by supply chain disruptions  severe weather patterns  natural disasters  widespread pandemics and other natural or man made disruptions 
we derive a significant amount of our total sales from stores located on the west and east coasts  particularly in california  which increases our exposure to conditions in these regions 
these disruptions could cause  among other things  a decrease in consumer spending that would negatively impact our sales  staffing shortages in our stores  distribution centers  or corporate offices  interruptions in the flow of merchandise to our stores  disruptions in the operations of our merchandise vendors or property developers  increased costs  and a negative impact on our reputation and long term growth plans 
anti takeover provisions we are incorporated in the state of washington and subject to washington state law 
some provisions of washington state law could interfere with or restrict takeover bids or other change in control events affecting us 
for example  one provision prohibits us  except under specified circumstances  from engaging in any significant business transaction with any shareholder who owns or more of our common stock an acquiring person for a period of five years following the time that the shareholder became an acquiring person

we were able to be less promotional and reduce markdowns during  particularly during the second half of the year  by aligning inventory with sales trends and improving our inventory turnover rate 
the improvement in our merchandise margin was offset by an increase in our buying and occupancy costs primarily driven by performance related incentives that were a result of strong company performance relative to our plans for nordstrom  inc and subsidiaries

table of contents credit segment the nordstrom credit and debit card products are designed to strengthen customer relationships and grow retail sales by providing valuable services  loyalty benefits and payment products 
we believe that owning all aspects of our credit business allows us to fully integrate our rewards program with our retail stores and provide better service to our customers  thus deepening our relationship with them and driving greater customer loyalty 
our nordstrom private label credit and debit cards can be used only in nordstrom stores and on our website inside volume  while our nordstrom visa cards also may be used for purchases outside of nordstrom outside volume 
cardholders participate in the nordstrom fashion rewards program  through which they accumulate points based on their level of spending generally two points per dollar spent at nordstrom and one point per dollar spent outside of nordstrom 
upon reaching two thousand points  customers receive twenty dollars in nordstrom notes  which can be redeemed for goods or services in our stores or online 
as customers increase their level of spending they receive additional benefits  including rewards such as complimentary shipping  early access to sale events and unique fashion and shopping events

these rules required us to make changes to our credit card business practices and systems 
we have completed and implemented the necessary changes and new procedures to enable compliance with those rules that are currently effective  and we expect more regulations and interpretations of the new rules to emerge 
depending on the nature and extent of the full impact from these rules  and any interpretations or additional rules  the practices  revenues and profitability of our credit segment could be adversely affected 
in addition  on july   the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act was enacted 
this law significantly restructures regulatory oversight and other aspects of the financial industry 
it creates a new federal agency to supervise and enforce consumer lending laws and regulations and expands state authority over consumer lending 
numerous regulations will be issued within the next year to implement the requirements of this act 
the final regulatory details remain highly uncertain at this time 
depending on the nature and extent of these regulations  and the enforcement approach of regulators under the new law  there could be an adverse impact to our credit segment

the fixed coverage ratio is defined as earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and rent ebitdar less gross capital expenditures interest expense  net rent expense the leverage ratio is defined as adjusted debt ebitdar see additional discussion of adjusted debt to ebitdar below 
as of january  and january   we were in compliance with these covenants 
we will continue to monitor these covenants to ensure that we make any necessary adjustments to our plans and believe that we will remain in compliance with these covenants during nordstrom  inc and subsidiaries 
table of contents adjusted debt to ebitdar non gaap financial measure we define adjusted debt to ebitdar as follows adjusted debt to ebitdar adjusted debt ebitdar adjusted debt to ebitdar is one of our key financial metrics  and we believe that our debt levels are best analyzed using this measure 
our current goal is to manage debt levels to maintain an investment grade credit rating as well as operate with an efficient capital structure for our size  growth plans and industry 
investment grade credit ratings are important to maintaining access to a variety of short term and long term sources of funding  and we rely on these funding sources to continue to grow our business 
we believe a higher ratio  among other factors  could result in rating agency downgrades 
in contrast  we believe a lower ratio would result in a higher cost of capital and could negatively impact shareholder returns 
as of january   our adjusted debt to ebitdar was compared with as of january  the decrease was primarily the result of an increase in earnings before interest and income taxes in compared with adjusted debt to ebitdar is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered a substitute for debt to net earnings  net earnings or debt as determined in accordance with gaap 
in addition  adjusted debt to ebitdar does have limitations adjusted debt is not exact  but rather our best estimate of the total company debt we would hold if we had purchased the property and issued debt associated with our operating leases  ebitdar does not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  including leases  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt  and other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted debt to ebitdar differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
to compensate for these limitations  we analyze adjusted debt to ebitdar in conjunction with other gaap financial and performance measures impacting liquidity  including operating cash flows  capital spending and net earnings 
the closest measure calculated using gaap amounts is debt to net earnings  which was and for and the following is a comparison of debt to net earnings and adjusted debt to ebitdar debt add rent expense x less fair value of interest rate swaps included in long term debt adjusted debt net earnings add income tax expense add interest expense  net earnings before interest and income taxes add depreciation and amortization of buildings and equipment  net add rent expense ebitdar debt to net earnings adjusted debt to ebitdar the components of adjusted debt are as of the end of and  while the components of ebitdar are for the months ended january  and january  the multiple of eight times rent expense used to calculate adjusted debt is a commonly used method of estimating the debt we would record for our leases that are classified as operating if they had met the criteria for a capital lease  or we had purchased the property 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and the expected effect on our liquidity and cash flows as of january  we expect to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business and credit available to us under existing and potential future facilities 
total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total included in the required debt repayments disclosed above are estimated total interest payments of  as of january   payable over the remaining life of the debts 
the capital and operating lease obligations in the table above do not include payments for operating expenses that are required by most of our lease agreements 
such expenses  which include common area charges  real estate taxes and other executory costs  totaled in  in and in in addition  some of our leases require additional rental payments based on a percentage of our sales  referred to as percentage rent 
percentage rent  which is also excluded from the obligations in the table above  was in each of  and purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for unreceived goods or services and capital expenditure commitments 
other long term liabilities consist of workers compensation and general liability insurance reserves and postretirement benefits 
the payment amounts presented above were estimated based on historical payment trends 
other long term liabilities not requiring cash payments  such as deferred property incentives and deferred revenue  were excluded from the table above 
also excluded from the table above are unrecognized tax benefits of  as we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash payments  if any  for these liabilities 
we had no off balance sheet arrangements  other than operating leases entered into in the normal course of business  during critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following discussion highlights the estimates we believe are critical and should be read in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements in item our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures that follow 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses reflects our best estimate of the losses inherent in our receivables as of the balance sheet date  including uncollectible finance charges and fees 
we estimate such credit losses based on several factors  including historical aging and delinquency trends  write off experience  concentration and risk metrics  and general economic conditions 
we believe the allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover anticipated losses in our credit card receivables under current conditions  however  significant deterioration in any of the factors mentioned above could materially change these expectations 
during  increases in unemployment and associated delinquency and write off trends prompted us to record significant increases to our allowance for credit losses  which increased from at january  to at january  as credit trends began to improve during  we reduced our allowance for credit losses by  from at january  to at january  a change in our allowance for credit losses would have affected net earnings by for the fiscal year ended january  revenue recognition we recognize revenue from sales at our retail stores at the point of sale  net of an allowance for estimated sales returns 
we estimate customer merchandise returns based on historical return patterns and reduce sales and cost of sales accordingly 
although we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates of sales returns  there is a possibility that actual returns could differ from recorded amounts 
in the past three years  we have made no material changes to our estimates included in the calculations of our sales return reserve 
a change in the sales return reserve would have had a impact on our net earnings for the year ended january  nordstrom  inc and subsidiaries 
table of contents inventory our merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value using the retail inventory method 
under the retail method  the valuation of inventories and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of ending inventory 
to determine if the retail value of our inventory should be marked down  we consider current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of the merchandise and fashion trends 
inherent in the retail inventory method are certain management judgments that may affect the ending inventory valuation as well as gross margin 
we reserve for obsolescence based on historical trends and specific identification 
our obsolescence reserve contains uncertainties as the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors  including market conditions  the selling environment  historical results and current inventory trends 
we do not believe that the assumptions used in these estimates will change significantly based on prior experience 
in the past three years  we have made no material changes to our estimates included in the calculations of the obsolescence reserve 
a change in the obsolescence reserve would not have had a material effect on our net earnings for the year ended january  income taxes we regularly evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit for income tax positions we have taken in various federal  state and foreign filings by considering all relevant facts  circumstances and information available to us 
if we believe it is more likely than not that our position will be sustained  we recognize a benefit at the largest amount which we believe is cumulatively greater than likely to be realized 
our unrecognized tax benefit was as of both january  and january  unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation  the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances 
also  as audits are completed or statutes of limitations lapse  it may be necessary to record adjustments to our taxes payable  deferred tax assets  tax reserves or income tax expense 
such adjustments did not materially impact our effective income tax rate in  but reduced our effective income tax rate by percentage points in recent accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
we do not expect any of these pronouncements to have a material effect on our results of operations  liquidity or capital resources

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in millions interest rate risk our primary exposure to market risk is through changes in interest rates 
as of january   we have gross credit card receivables of  which generate finance charge income at a combination of fixed and variable rates  and long term debt of  including  that bears interest at libor based rates 
changing interest rates can therefore affect our credit card revenues and interest expense 
the annualized effect of a one percentage point change in interest rates would not materially affect our net earnings  cash flows or the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
we manage our net interest rate exposure through our mix of fixed and variable rate borrowings and associated current and long term assets 
from time to time  we may also enter into interest rate swap transactions for purposes of hedging the exposure of changes in fair value of our long term debt from interest rate risk 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and are not party to any leveraged financial instruments 
the table below presents information about our long term debt obligations and interest rate swaps that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of january  for debt obligations  including our capital leases  the table presents principal amounts  at book value  by maturity date  and related weighted average interest rates
