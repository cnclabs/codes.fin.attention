table of contents on july   we terminated our million amended and restated revolving credit agreement the credit facility with bank of america  na and the privatebank and trust company and entered into a new credit agreement with the privatebank and trust company the line of credit 
we repaid the borrowings under the credit facility on the termination date with existing cash balances and have completed our obligations under this agreement 
the line of credit  which provides for an aggregate commitment over its four year term of million subject to certain borrowing base limitations  allows us to choose between three interest rate options in connection with our borrowings 
the interest rate options are the base rate  libor and fixed rate all as defined within the line of credit plus an applicable margin of  and  respectively 
interest periods for libor borrowings can be one  two or three months  and interest periods for fixed rate borrowings can be one  two  three or four years as selected by us 
the line of credit also provides for non utilization fees of per annum on the daily average of the unused commitment 
as of december   our borrowing availability under the line of credit was million the lesser of the borrowing base or the aggregate commitment 
there were million in borrowings outstanding under the line of credit bearing interest ranging from to  leaving million available for additional borrowings 
the line of credit was used to complete the redemption of the renewable unsecured subordinated notes as indicated below and has been and will continue to be used for general corporate purposes 
the line of credit is secured by a lien against substantially all of our assets  contains customary financial conditions and covenants  and requires maintenance of minimum levels of debt service coverage and tangible net worth and maximum levels of leverage all as defined within the line of credit 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants 
on april   we announced the filing of a shelf registration on form s registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the sale of up to million of renewable subordinated unsecured notes with maturities from three months to ten years 
in june  the form s registration became effective 
every year since the s registration became effective  we have filed post effective amendments to keep the registration statement effective

we borrowed million on our line of credit to finance the redemption 
we may utilize discounted lease financing to provide funds for a portion of our leasing activities 
rates for discounted lease financing reflect prevailing market interest rates and the credit standing of the lessees for which the payment stream of the leases are discounted 
we believe that discounted lease financing will continue to be available to us at competitive rates of interest through the relationships we have established with financial institutions 
we believe that the combination of our cash on hand  the cash generated from our franchising business  cash generated from discounting sources and our line of credit will be adequate to fund our planned operations  including leasing activity  through 
table of contents critical accounting policies the company prepares the consolidated financial statements of winmark corporation and subsidiaries in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  the company is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from these estimates 
the critical accounting policies that the company believes are most important to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition royalty revenue and franchise fees the company collects royalties from each retail franchise based on a percentage of retail store gross sales 
the company recognizes royalties as revenue when earned 
at the end of each accounting period  estimates of royalty amounts due are made based on applying historical weekly sales information to the number of weeks of unreported franchisee sales 
if there are significant changes in the actual performances of franchisees versus the company s estimates  its royalty revenue would be impacted 
during  the company collected  more than it estimated at december  as of december   the company s royalty receivable was  the company collects initial franchise fees when franchise agreements are signed and recognizes the initial franchise fees as revenue when the franchise is opened  which is when the company has performed substantially all initial services required by the franchise agreement 
franchise fees collected from franchisees but not yet recognized as income are recorded as deferred revenue in the liability section of the consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   deferred franchise fees were  leasing income recognition leasing income is recognized under the effective interest method 
the effective interest method of income recognition applies a constant rate of interest equal to the internal rate of return on the lease 
generally  when a lease is more than days delinquent when more than three monthly payments are owed  the lease is classified as being on non accrual and the company stops recognizing leasing income on that date 
payments received on leases in non accrual status generally reduce the lease receivable 
leases on non accrual status remain classified as such until there is sustained payment performance that  in the company s judgment  would indicate that all contractual amounts will be collected in full 
in certain circumstances  the company may re lease equipment in its existing portfolio 
this may give rise to dealer profit and require the company to account for the lease as a sales type lease 
at inception of a sales type lease  revenue is recorded that consists of the present value of the future minimum lease payments discounted at the rate implicit in the lease 
in subsequent periods  the recording of income is consistent with the accounting for a direct financing lease 
allowance for credit losses the company maintains an allowance for credit losses at an amount that it believes to be sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the existing lease portfolio as of the reporting dates 
leases are collectively evaluated for potential loss 
the company s methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses includes consideration of the level of delinquencies and non accrual leases  historical net charge off amounts and review of any significant concentrations 

table of contents a provision is charged against earnings to maintain the allowance for credit losses at the appropriate level 
the company s policy is to charge off against the allowance the estimated unrecoverable portion of accounts once they reach days delinquent 
the allowance for credit losses is considered a significant estimate that could materially change within the next year 
see note for disclosures related to the company s allowance for credit losses 
stock based compensation the company currently uses the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of the awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include implied volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
the company evaluates the assumptions used to value awards on an annual basis 
if factors change and the company employs different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if the company decides to use a different valuation model  the future periods may differ significantly from what it has recorded in the current period and could materially affect operating income  net income and earnings per share 
impairment of long term investments the company evaluates its long term investments for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the impairment  if any  is measured by the difference between the assets carrying amount and their fair value as prescribed by applicable accounting guidance based on the best information available  including market prices  discounted cash flow analysis or other financial metrics that management utilizes to help determine fair value 
judgments made by management related to the fair value of its long term investments are affected by factors such as the ongoing financial performance of the investees  additional capital raised by the investees as well as general changes in the economy 
if there are significant changes in the actual performance of the long term investments versus the company s estimates  t he carrying values of these investments could be significantly impacted 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued new accounting guidance that requires new disclosures about an entity s allowance for credit losses and the credit quality of its financing receivables 
existing disclosures are amended to require an entity to provide certain disclosures on a disaggregated basis by portfolio segment or by class of financing receivables 
the new and amended disclosures that relate to information as of the end of a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after december  the disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after december  the company has adopted the new and amended disclosures that relate to information as of the end of a reporting period in this annual report on form k f or the fiscal year ending december   see note for disclosures related to this adoption 
the company will begin to include the disclosures that relate to information for activity that occurs during a reporting period in its quarterly report on form q for the fiscal period ending march  the adoption of these disclosure requirements has not and will not have an impact on the consolidated results of the company
