part i item business general 
titanium metals corporation is one of the world s leading producers of titanium melted and mill products 
we are the only producer with major titanium production facilities in both the united states and europe  the world s principal markets for titanium consumption 
we are currently the largest us producer of titanium sponge  a key raw material  and a major recycler of titanium scrap 
titanium metals corporation was formed in and was incorporated in delaware in unless otherwise indicated  references in this report to we  us or our refer to timet and its subsidiaries  taken as a whole 
titanium was first manufactured for commercial use in the s 
titanium s unique combination of corrosion resistance  elevated temperature performance and high strength to weight ratio makes it particularly desirable for use in commercial and military aerospace applications where these qualities satisfy essential design requirements for certain critical parts such as wing supports and jet engine components 
while aerospace applications have historically accounted for a substantial portion of the worldwide demand for titanium  other end use applications for titanium in military and industrial markets have continued to develop  including the use of titanium based alloys in armor plating  structural components  chemical plants  power plants  desalination plants and pollution control equipment 
additionally  demand for titanium in emerging markets is supported by diverse uses including oil and gas production installations  automotive  geothermal facilities and architectural applications 
our products include titanium sponge  melted products  mill products and industrial fabrications 
the titanium industry is comprised of several manufacturers that  like us  produce a relatively complete range of titanium products and a significant number of producers worldwide that manufacture a limited range of titanium mill products 
our long term strategy is to maximize the value of our core aerospace business while expanding our presence in non aerospace markets and developing new applications and products 
our existing productive capacity and the availability of our secure third party conversion capabilities allow us to efficiently respond to the industry s demand volatility 
we will continue to evaluate opportunities to strategically expand our existing production and conversion capacities through internal expansion and long term third party arrangements  as well as potential joint ventures and acquisitions 
titanium industry 
we develop certain industry estimates based on our extensive experience within the titanium industry as well as information obtained from publicly available external resources eg  united states geological survey  international titanium association and japan titanium society 
we estimate we accounted for approximately of and of worldwide industry shipments of titanium mill products and approximately of worldwide titanium sponge production in and in the following chart illustrates our estimates of aggregate industry mill product shipments over the past ten years industry mill product shipments by sector volumes exclude shipments within china and russia logo the cyclical nature of the commercial aerospace sector has been the principal driver of the historical fluctuations in titanium mill product shipment volume 
over the past years  the titanium industry has had various cyclical peaks and troughs in mill product shipments 
with the exception of decreased demand in resulting from the global economic downturn  over the last ten years  titanium mill product demand in the military  industrial and emerging market sectors has increased  primarily due to the continued development of innovative uses for titanium products in these industries 
we estimate that industry shipments approximated  metric tons in and  metric tons in the estimated increase in was driven by strong recoveries from the global economic downturn in in the commercial aerospace and industrial sectors 
we currently expect total industry mill product shipments to grow to  driven by continued growth in the commercial aerospace and industrial sectors 
commercial aerospace sector demand for titanium products within the commercial aerospace sector is derived from both jet engine components eg  blades  discs  rings and engine cases and airframe components eg  bulkheads  tail sections  landing gear  wing supports and fasteners 
the commercial aerospace sector has a significant influence on titanium companies  particularly mill product producers 
industry shipments increased approximately in as aircraft build rates and supply chain inventory levels increased 
deliveries of titanium generally precede aircraft deliveries by about one year  and our business cycle generally correlates to this timeline  although the actual timeline can vary considerably depending on the titanium product 
our business is more dependent on commercial aerospace demand than is the overall titanium industry 
we shipped approximately of our mill products to the commercial aerospace sector in  whereas we estimate approximately of the overall titanium industry s mill products were shipped to the commercial aerospace sector in the airline monitor  a leading aerospace publication  traditionally issues worldwide forecasts each january and july for commercial aircraft deliveries  approximately one third of which are expected to be required by the us over the next years 
the airline monitor s most recently issued forecast january estimates deliveries of large commercial aircraft aircraft with over seats totaled  including twin aisle aircraft which require more titanium in  and the following table summarizes the forecasted deliveries of large commercial aircraft over the next five years forecasted deliveries increase over previous year year total twin aisle total twin aisle the latest forecast from the airline monitor reflects a moderate increase in forecasted deliveries over the next five years compared to the july forecast  mainly due to its expectation that airlines will continue to replace their fleets with more fuel efficient aircraft 
boeing and airbus booked a total of  orders in  and the airline monitor forecasts that aggregate new orders in will be lower than changes in the economic environment and the financial condition of airlines can result in rescheduling or cancellation of orders 
accordingly  aircraft manufacturer backlogs are not necessarily a reliable indicator of near term business activity but may be indicative of potential business levels over a longer term horizon 
the latest forecast from the airline monitor estimates decreases for firm order backlog for both airbus and boeing as deliveries are expected to be higher than orders for the next three years 
through december   airbus firm order backlog is estimated at  twin aisle planes and  single aisle planes  and boeing s firm order backlog is estimated at  twin aisle planes and  single aisle planes 
boeing has previously announced that its does not plan to increase its build rates on the aircraft to make up for delayed deliveries 
at year end  a total of firm orders have been placed for the boeing  a total of firm orders have been placed for the airbus a and a total of firm orders had been placed for the airbus a xwb 
the contains more composite materials than other boeing aircraft  and increased utilization of composite materials in an aircraft s structural components requires additional titanium on a per unit basis 
the a xwbs will also use composite materials and new engines similar to those used on the boeing and are expected to require significantly more titanium as compared with earlier airbus models 
in early years of the manufacturing cycle for the and a xwb  or with any aircraft model  additional titanium is required to produce each aircraft  and as the program reaches maturity  less titanium is required for each aircraft manufactured 
first deliveries for the are currently scheduled in late  and first deliveries for the a xwb are currently scheduled for twin aisle planes eg  boeing   and and airbus a  a  a and a tend to use a higher percentage of titanium in their airframes  engines and parts than single aisle planes eg  boeing and and airbus a  a and a  and new generation models require a significantly higher percentage of titanium 
additionally  boeing generally uses a higher percentage of titanium in its airframes than airbus 
based on information we receive from airframe and engine manufacturers and other industry sources  we estimate the following titanium product purchase weights will be used for the manufacture of each of the selected aircraft in the following table 
all estimated titanium purchase weights include both the airframes and engines  and purchase weights are subject to change as manufacturers and other industry sources revise their estimates 
titanium purchased per aircraft approximate metric tons boeing aircraft airbus aircraft a a a a xwb a military sector titanium shipments into the military sector are largely driven by government defense spending in north america and europe 
military aerospace programs were the first to utilize titanium s unique properties on a large scale  beginning in the s 
titanium shipments to military aerospace markets reached a peak in the s before falling to historical lows in the early s after the end of the cold war 
based on its physical and performance properties  titanium has also become widely accepted for use in applications for ground combat vehicles as well as in naval vessels 
current and anticipated future military strategy leading to light armament and mobility favor the use of titanium due to light weight and improved ballistic performance 
as the strategic military environment demands greater global lift and mobility  the us military needs more airlift capacity and capability 
airframe programs are expected to drive the military market demand for titanium through several of today s active us military programs  including the c  f  f a and f  are currently expected to continue in production into the middle of this decade 
european military programs also have active aerospace programs offering the possibility for increased titanium consumption 
production levels for the saab gripen  eurofighter typhoon  dassault rafale and dassault mirage are all forecasted to remain steady through the middle or end of this decade 
in addition to the established programs  newer us programs offer growth opportunities for increased titanium consumption 
the f joint strike fighter  now known as the lightning ii  has begun low rate initial production and assembly 
although no specific delivery schedules have been announced  according to the teal group  a leading aerospace publication  procurement of the f is expected to extend over the next to years and may include production of as many as  planes  including sales to foreign nations 
utilization of titanium on military ground combat vehicles for armor appliqu and integrated armor or structural components continues to gain acceptance within the global military market segment 
titanium armor components provide the necessary ballistic performance while achieving a mission critical vehicle performance objective of reduced weight in new generation and legacy vehicles 
in order to counteract increased global threat levels  titanium is being utilized on vehicle upgrade programs as well as in new programs 
based on active programs  as well as programs currently under evaluation  we believe titanium will continue to be used on ground combat vehicles in the military market sector 
in armor and armament  we sell complete vehicle armor kits as well as plate and sheet products for fabrication into appliqu plate and reactive armor for protection of the entire ground combat vehicle as well as the vehicle s primary structure 
industrial and emerging markets sectors with its unique and desirable physical properties  titanium can be used in a number of other end use markets 
established industrial uses for titanium include chemical plants  power plants  desalination plants and pollution control equipment 
rapid growth of the chinese and other southeast asian economies has brought unprecedented demand for titanium intensive industrial equipment 
in order to participate in this rise in demand  we have an ownership interest in a joint venture  xi an baotimet valinox tubes co 
ltd 
baotimet  which produces welded titanium tubing in xi an  china 
titanium is accepted for many emerging market applications  including transportation  energy including oil and gas and architecture 
although titanium is often more expensive than other competing metals  over the entire life cycle of the application  we believe titanium is a better value alternative due to its durability  longevity and overall environmental impact 
in many cases customers also find the physical properties of titanium to be attractive from the standpoint of weight  performance  design alternatives and other factors 
the oil and gas market  a relatively new  potentially large growth area  utilizes titanium in certain down hole casing  critical riser components  tapered stress joints  fire suppression water pump systems and saltwater cooling systems 
additionally  as offshore development of new oil and gas fields moves into the ultra deep water depths and as geothermal energy production expands  market demand for titanium s light weight  high strength and corrosion resistance properties is creating potential new growth opportunities 
we have resources dedicated to the research and development of alloys and production processes to promote the expansion of titanium use in this market and in other non aerospace applications 
although we estimate emerging market demand presently represents less than of the total industry demand for titanium mill products  we believe the emerging market sector offers many opportunities  and we have ongoing initiatives to actively pursue and expand our presence in these markets 
products and operations 
we are a vertically integrated titanium manufacturer whose products include i titanium sponge  the basic form of titanium metal used in titanium products  ii melted products ingot  electrode and slab  the result of melting titanium sponge and titanium scrap  either alone or with various alloys  iii mill products that are forged and rolled from ingot or slab  including long products billet and bar  flat products plate  sheet and strip and pipe  and iv fabrications spools  pipe fittings  manifolds  vessels  etc 
that are cut  formed  welded and assembled from titanium mill products 
all of our net sales were generated by our integrated titanium operations our titanium melted and mill products segment  which is our only business segment 
business and geographic financial information is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
titanium sponge is the commercially pure  elemental form of titanium metal with a porous and sponge like appearance 
the first step in our sponge production involves combining titanium containing rutile ore derived from beach sand with chlorine and petroleum coke to produce titanium tetrachloride 
titanium tetrachloride is purified and then reacted with magnesium in a closed system  producing titanium sponge and residual magnesium chloride as a by product 
our titanium sponge production facility in henderson  nevada uses vacuum distillation process vdp technology  which removes the magnesium and magnesium chloride residues by applying heat to the sponge mass while maintaining a vacuum in a chamber 
the combination of heat and vacuum boils the residues from the sponge mass  and then the sponge mass is mechanically pushed out of the distillation vessel  sheared and crushed to prepare the sponge for incorporation into one of our melted products 
we electrolytically separate and recycle the residual magnesium chloride to improve cost efficiency and reduce environmental impact 
we use all of our internally produced titanium sponge in the production of our melted and mill products 
melted products ingot  electrode and slab are produced by melting sponge and titanium scrap  either alone or with alloys  to produce various grades of titanium products suited to the ultimate application of the product 
by introducing other alloys such as vanadium  aluminum  molybdenum  tin and zirconium  the melted titanium product is engineered to produce quality grades with varying combinations of certain physical attributes such as strength to weight ratio  corrosion resistance and milling compatibility 
titanium ingot is a cylindrical solid shape that  in our case  weighs up to metric tons 
titanium slab is a rectangular solid shape that  in our case  weighs up to metric tons 
the melting process for ingot and slab is closely controlled and monitored utilizing computer control systems to maintain product quality and consistency and to meet customer specifications 
in most cases  we use our ingot and slab as the intermediate material for further processing into mill products 
however  we also sell melted products to our customers 
mill products are forged or rolled from our melted products ingot or slab 
mill products include long products billet and bar  flat products plate  sheet and strip and pipe 
our mill products can be further machined to meet customer specifications with respect to size and finish 
we send certain products to various outside vendors for further processing eg  certain rolling  forging  finishing and other processing steps in the us  and certain melting and forging steps in france before being shipped to customers 
we currently utilize one us supplier under a year conversion services agreement  whereby they provide an annual output capacity of  metric tons of titanium mill rolling services until  with our option to increase the annual output capacity to  metric tons 
additionally  another us supplier provides dedicated annual forging capacity of  metric tons through at least in france  our primary processor is also a partner in our owned subsidiary  timet savoie  sa  and our agreement with them provides us with annual melt capacity of up to  metric tons and annual mill capacity up to  metric tons through these agreements and partnerships provide us with long term secure sources for processing round and flat products  resulting in a significant increase in our existing mill product conversion capabilities  which allows us to assure our customers of our long term ability to meet their needs 
during the production process and following the completion of manufacturing  we perform extensive testing on our products 
sonic inspection as well as chemical and mechanical testing procedures are critical to ensuring that our products meet our customers high quality requirements  particularly in aerospace component production 
we certify that our products meet customer specification at the time of shipment for substantially all customer orders 
titanium scrap is a by product of the forging  rolling and machining operations  and significant quantities of scrap are generated in the production process for finished titanium products and components 
scrap by products from our mill production processes  as well as the scrap purchased from our customers or on the open metals market  is typically recycled and introduced into the melting process once the scrap is sorted and cleaned 
we have the capacity to recycle  to  metric tons of titanium scrap annually at our facility in morgantown  pennsylvania depending on the form of the scrap and end use product mix 
we believe our capability and expertise in recycling titanium scrap provides us with a competitive advantage in the titanium industry 
distribution 
we sell our products through our own sales force based in the us and europe and through independent agents and distributors worldwide 
we also operate eight service centers five in the us and three in europe  which we use to sell our products on a just in time basis 
the service centers primarily sell value added and customized mill products  including bar  sheet  plate  tubing and strip 
we believe our service centers provide us with a competitive advantage because of our ability to foster customer relationships  customize products to suit specific customer requirements and respond quickly to customer needs 
raw materials 
the principal raw materials used in the production of titanium melted and mill products are titanium sponge  titanium scrap and alloys 
the proportions and grades of sponge and scrap are sometimes dictated by the product mix or customer requirements for the end use product  however  we generally have the operating flexibility to vary the raw material components to optimize our manufacturing efficiency and maximize our profitability 
the following table summarizes our raw material usage requirements in the production of our melted and mill products internally produced sponge purchased sponge titanium scrap alloys total sponge the primary raw materials used in the production of titanium sponge are titanium containing rutile ore  chlorine  magnesium and petroleum coke 
rutile ore is currently available from a limited number of suppliers around the world  principally located in australia  south africa and sri lanka 
we purchase the majority of our supply of rutile ore from australia and south africa 
although rutile ore supplies have tightened in the past year  we believe the availability of rutile ore will be adequate for the foreseeable future and do not anticipate any interruptions of our rutile supplies 
we currently obtain chlorine from a single supplier near our sponge plant in henderson  nevada 
while we do not anticipate any chlorine supply problems  we have taken steps to mitigate this risk in the event of supply disruption  including establishing the feasibility of certain equipment modifications to enable us to utilize material from alternative chlorine suppliers or to purchase and utilize an intermediate product which will allow us to eliminate the purchase of chlorine if needed 
magnesium and petroleum coke are generally available from a number of suppliers 
we are currently the largest us producer of titanium sponge  with an annual sponge production capacity of approximately  metric tons of premium grade titanium sponge at our henderson plant 
we operated our sponge plant significantly below full capacity during and  but we anticipate increased production volumes during as we ramp up production to meet anticipated demand 
we supplement our internally produced sponge with purchases from third parties 
in recent years  other sponge producers have also undertaken additional capacity expansion projects 
we are party to long term sponge supply agreements that require us to make minimum annual purchases 
these long term supply agreements  together with our current sponge production capacity in henderson  should provide us with a total annual available sponge supply at levels ranging from  metric tons up to  metric tons through  which we expect will meet our sponge supply requirements 
we will continue to purchase sponge from a variety of sources in  including those sources under existing supply agreements 
we continuously evaluate alternatives to strategically balance our internal and external sources for titanium sponge 
scrap we recycle titanium scrap into melted products that will be sold to our customers or used as intermediate feedstock for our mill production process 
our titanium scrap is generated from our melted and mill product production processes  purchased from certain of our customers under contractual agreements or acquired in the open metals market 
such scrap consists of alloyed and commercially pure solids and turnings 
scrap obtained through customer arrangements provides a closed loop arrangement resulting in certainty of supply and price stability 
externally purchased scrap comes from a wide range of sources  including customers  collectors  processors and brokers 
we purchased of our scrap requirements from the open metals market in  and we expect our open market scrap purchases to account for to of our scrap requirements during we will continue to manage our scrap consumption and utilization percentages based upon the market values of scrap relative to sponge and alloy costs as we strive to minimize our overall product costs 
we also routinely sell scrap  usually in a form or grade we cannot economically recycle for use in our production operations 
overall market forces can significantly impact the supply or cost of externally produced scrap  as the amount of scrap generated in the supply chain varies during titanium business cycles 
early in the titanium cycle  the demand for titanium melted and mill products begins to increase the externally produced scrap requirements for titanium manufacturers 
this demand precedes the increase in scrap generation by downstream customers and the supply chain 
the reduced availability of scrap at this stage of the cycle places upward pressure on the market price of scrap 
the opposite situation occurs when demand for titanium melted and mill products begins to decline  resulting in greater availability of scrap supply and downward pressure on the market price of scrap 
during the middle of the cycle  scrap generation and consumption are in relative equilibrium  minimizing disruptions in supply or significant changes in the available supply and market price for scrap 
increasing or decreasing cycles tend to cause significant changes in both the supply and market price of scrap 
these supply chain dynamics result in changes in selling prices for melted and mill products which generally tend to correspond with the changes in raw material costs 
all of our major competitors utilize scrap as a raw material in their titanium melt operations  and steel manufacturers also use titanium scrap as an alloy to produce interstitial free steels  stainless steels and high strength low alloy steels 
prices for most forms and grades of titanium scrap increased during the last quarter of and the first three quarters of  as both the steel and titanium markets began to recover from the global recession which impacted demand throughout most of during late  prices stabilized somewhat  although we expect that strong demand will lead to further increases early in other various alloy additions used in the production of titanium products  such as vanadium and molybdenum  are also available from a number of suppliers 
consistent demand from steel manufacturers for vanadium and molybdenum resulted in stable costs for these alloys in at levels similar to those of the second half of we expect these cost trends to continue into customer agreements 
we have long term agreements ltas with certain major customers  including  among others  the boeing company boeing  rolls royce plc and its german and us affiliates rolls royce  united technologies corporation utc  pratt whitney and related companies  the safran companies safran  snecma and related companies  wyman gordon company wyman gordon  a unit of precision castparts corporation pcc and valtimet sas 
these agreements expire at various times through  are subject to certain conditions and generally provide for i minimum market shares of the customers titanium requirements or firm annual volume commitments  ii formula determined prices including some elements based on market pricing and iii price adjustments for certain raw material  labor and energy cost fluctuations 
generally  ltas require our service and product performance to meet specified criteria and contain a number of other terms and conditions customary in transactions of these types 
certain provisions of these ltas have been amended in the past and may be amended in the future to meet changing business conditions 
our sales revenues to customers under ltas were of our total sales revenues 
in certain events of nonperformance by us or the customer  an lta may be terminated early 
although it is possible that some portion of the business would continue on a non lta basis  ltas are designed to limit selling price volatility to the customer and to us  while providing us with a committed volume base throughout the titanium industry business cycles and certain mechanisms to adjust pricing for changes in certain cost elements 
as a result  the termination or expiration without renewal of one or more of the ltas could result in a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
markets and customer base 
as discussed previously  we produce a wide range of melted and mill titanium products for our customers  and selling prices generally reflect raw material and other productions costs as well as reasonable profit margins 
selling prices are generally influenced by industry and global economic conditions 
products sold under certain ltas with raw material indexed pricing adjustments  as well as our non contract sales  were impacted by these factors 
the demand for our titanium products is global  and our global productive capabilities allow us to respond to our customers needs 
the following table summarizes our sales revenue by geographical location year ended december  percentage of total sales revenue sales revenue to customers within north america europe other total further information regarding our external sales  net income  long lived assets and total assets can be found in our consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of income and notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
our concentration of customers  primarily in commercial aerospace  may impact our overall exposure to credit and other risks because all of these customers may be similarly affected by the same economic or other conditions 
the following table provides supplemental sales revenue information year ended december  percentage of total sales revenue ten largest customers significant customers pcc and pcc related entities boeing total ltas significant ltas rolls royce boeing pcc and pcc related entities primarily wyman gordon serve as suppliers to certain commercial aerospace manufacturers  including rolls royce

the following table provides supplemental sales revenue information by industry sector year ended december  percentage of total sales revenue commercial aerospace military industrial and emerging markets other titanium products total the primary market for titanium products in the commercial aerospace sector consists of two major manufacturers of large commercial airframes  boeing commercial airplanes group a unit of boeing and airbus  as well as manufacturers of large civil aircraft engines including rolls royce  general electric aircraft engines  pratt whitney and safran 
we sell directly to these major manufacturers  as well as to companies including forgers such as wyman gordon that use our titanium to produce parts and other materials for such manufacturers 
if any of the major aerospace manufacturers were to significantly reduce aircraft and or jet engine build rates from those currently expected  there could be a material adverse effect  both directly and indirectly  on our business  results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
the market for titanium in the military sector includes sales of melted and mill titanium products engineered for applications for military aircraft both engines and airframes  armor and component parts  armor appliqu on ground combat vehicles and other integrated armor or structural components 
we sell directly to many of the major manufacturers associated with military programs on a global basis 
outside of commercial aerospace and military sectors  we manufacture a wide range of products for customers in the chemical process  oil and gas  consumer  sporting goods  healthcare  automotive and power generation sectors 
additionally  we sell certain other products such as titanium fabrications  titanium scrap and titanium tetrachloride 
we will also continue to work with existing and potential customers to identify and develop new or improved applications for titanium that take advantage of its unique properties and qualities 
our backlog was approximately million at december  and million at december  over of our year end backlog is scheduled for shipment during our order backlog may not be a reliable indicator of future business activity 
competition 
the titanium metals industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis 
producers of melted and mill products are located primarily in the united states  japan  france  germany  italy  russia  china and the united kingdom 
there are also several producers of titanium sponge in the world that are currently in some stage of increasing sponge production capacity 
we believe entry as a new producer of titanium sponge would require a significant capital investment  substantial technical expertise and significant lead time 
additionally  producers of other metal products  such as steel and aluminum  maintain forging  rolling and finishing facilities that could be used or modified to process titanium products 
our principal competitors in the aerospace titanium market are allegheny technologies incorporated ati and rti international metals  inc rti  both based in the united states  and verkhnaya salda metallurgical production organization vsmpo  based in russia 
uniti a joint venture between ati and vsmpo  rti and certain japanese producers are our principal competitors in the industrial and emerging markets 
we compete primarily on the basis of price  quality of products  technical support and the availability of products to meet customers delivery schedules 
in the us market  the increasing presence of foreign participants has become a significant competitive factor 
prior to  imports of foreign titanium products into the us were not significant  primarily attributable to relative currency exchange rates and  with respect to japan  russia  kazakhstan and ukraine  import duties including antidumping duties 
however  since  imports of titanium sponge  ingot and mill products  principally from russia and kazakhstan  have increased and have had a significant competitive impact on the us titanium industry 
trade and tariffs generally  imports of titanium products into the us are subject to a normal trade relations tariff 
for tariff purposes  titanium products are broadly classified as either wrought billet  bar  sheet  strip  plate and tubing or unwrought sponge  ingot and slab 
because a significant portion of end use products made from titanium products are ultimately exported  we  along with our principal competitors and many customers  actively utilize the duty drawback mechanism to recover most of the tariff paid on imports 
from time to time  the us government has granted preferential trade status to certain titanium products imported from particular countries notably wrought titanium products from russia  which carried no us import duties from approximately until 
it is possible that such preferential status could be granted again in the future 
the japanese government has raised the elimination or harmonization of tariffs on titanium products  including titanium sponge  for consideration in multi lateral trade negotiations through the world trade organization the so called doha round 
as part of the doha round  the united states has proposed the staged elimination of all industrial tariffs  including those on titanium 
the japanese government has specifically asked that titanium in all its forms be included in the tariff elimination program 
we have urged that no change be made to these tariffs  either on wrought or unwrought products 
tariffs on titanium imported from other countries might also be eliminated pursuant to bilateral and or multilateral free trade agreements that are currently the subject of ongoing negotiations to which the us government is a party 
we will continue to resist efforts to eliminate duties on titanium products  although we may not be successful in these activities 
further reductions in  or the complete elimination of  any or all of these tariffs could lead to increased imports of foreign sponge  ingot  slab and mill products into the us and an increase in the amount of such products on the market generally  which could adversely affect pricing for titanium sponge  ingot  slab and mill products and thus our business  results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
the specialty metals law  usc b  provides that  subject to various exceptions  the department of defense dod may not procure certain defense articles aircraft  missiles  spacecraft  ships  tanks  weapons and ammunition containing specialty metals  including titanium  unless those defense articles are manufactured with specialty metals melted or produced in the united states 
in  the dod adopted regulations regarding the implementation of this specialty metals law that may reduce its effectiveness 
we will continue to resist attempts to undermine this specialty metals law 
a weakening in the enforcement of this specialty metals law could increase foreign competition for sales of titanium for defense products  adversely affecting our business  results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
research and development 
our research and development activities are directed toward expanding the use of titanium and titanium alloys in all market sectors 
key research activities include the development of new alloys  development of technology required to enhance the performance of our products in the traditional industrial and aerospace markets and applications development for emerging markets 
in addition  we continue to work in partnership with the united states defense advanced research projects agency darpa and others to explore means to reduce the cost of titanium production 
the work with darpa complements our research  development and exploration of innovative technologies and improvements to the existing processes such as vacuum distillation of sponge and vacuum arc remelting processes 
we conduct the majority of our research and development activities at our henderson technical laboratory  with additional activities at our witton  england facility 
we incurred research and development costs of million in  million in and million in patents and trademarks 
we hold us and us patents applicable to certain of our titanium alloys and manufacturing technology  which expire at various times from through and we have certain other patent applications pending 
we continually seek patent protection with respect to our technology base and have occasionally entered into cross licensing arrangements with third parties 
however  the majority of our titanium alloys and manufacturing technologies do not benefit from patent protection 
we believe the trademarks timet and timetal  which are protected by registration in the us and other countries  are important to our business 
employees 
our employee headcount varies due to the cyclical nature of the aerospace industry and its impact on our business 
our employee headcount includes both our full and part time employees 
the following table shows our approximate employee headcount at the end of the past years employees at december  us europe total our production and maintenance workers in henderson and our production  maintenance  clerical and technical workers in toronto  ohio approximately half of our total us employees are represented by the united steelworkers of america under contracts expiring in january and june  respectively 
employees at our other us facilities are not covered by collective bargaining agreements 
a majority of the salaried and hourly employees at our european facilities are represented by various european labor unions 
our labor agreement with our uk managerial and professional employees expires in march  and our labor agreement with our uk production and maintenance employees expires in december our labor agreements with our french and italian employees are renewed annually 
we currently consider our employee relations to be good 
however  it is possible that there could be future work stoppages or other labor disruptions that could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
regulatory and environmental matters 
our operations are governed by various federal  state  local and foreign environmental  security and worker safety and health laws and regulations 
in the us  such laws include the occupational  safety and health act  the clean air act  the clean water act  the toxic substances control act and the resource conservation and recovery act 
we use and manufacture substantial quantities of substances that are considered hazardous  extremely hazardous or toxic under environmental and worker safety and health laws and regulations 
we have used and manufactured such substances throughout the history of our operations 
although we have substantial controls and procedures designed to reduce continuing risk of environmental  health and safety issues  we could incur substantial cleanup costs  fines and civil or criminal sanctions  third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations or liabilities under these laws  common law theories of liability or non compliance with environmental permits required at our facilities 
in addition  government environmental requirements or the enforcement thereof may become more stringent in the future 
it is possible that some  or all  of these risks could result in liabilities that would be material to our business  results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
our policy is to maintain compliance in all material respects with applicable requirements of environmental and worker health and safety laws and strive to improve environmental  health and safety performance 
we incurred capital expenditures related to health  safety and environmental compliance and improvement of approximately million in  million in and million in from time to time  we may be subject to health  safety or environmental regulatory enforcement under various statutes  resolution of which typically involves the establishment of compliance programs 
occasionally  resolution of these matters may result in the payment of penalties or the expenditure of additional funds on compliance 
furthermore  the imposition of more strict standards or requirements under environmental  health or safety laws and regulations could result in expenditures in excess of amounts currently estimated to be required for such matters 
as a result of environmental protection agency epa inspections  in april the epa issued a notice of violation notice to us alleging that we violated certain provisions of the resource conservation and recovery act and the toxic substances control act tsca at our henderson plant 
we responded to the epa and are currently in discussions with them concerning the nature and extent of required follow up testing and potential remediation that may be required to address the allegations of non compliance 
during  we submitted detailed proposals for testing that will provide information to assist us in determining the scope and method of any remediation that may be required under the notice 
in addition  we submitted proposals for work intended to resolve two of the alleged violations identified in the notice 
in may  the epa notified us alleging two unrelated violations of the recordkeeping and reporting requirements of tsca at our henderson plant and also initiated an investigation of our morgantown plant under these provisions of tsca 
in june  with epa approval  we conducted a voluntary self audit of tsca compliance at all of our us facilities and disclosed the results of the self audit to the epa  including our findings with respect to areas of non compliance 
as part of our continuing environmental assessment with respect to our plant site in henderson  nevada  in we completed and submitted to the nevada department of environmental protection ndep a remedial alternative study ras with respect to the groundwater located beneath the plant site 
the ras  which was submitted pursuant to an existing agreement between the ndep and us  addressed the presence of certain contaminants in the plant site groundwater that require remediation 
the ndep completed its review of the ras and our proposed remedial alternatives  and the ndep issued its record of decision in february  which selected our preferred groundwater remedial alternative action plan 
we commenced implementation of the plan in the fourth quarter of in connection with our implementation of the plan  we are undertaking soil remediation to address source areas associated with conveyance ditches previously used by several companies in the bmi complex  the cost of which is covered by insurance

item a risk factors listed below are certain risk factors associated with our business 
in addition to the potential effect of these risk factors discussed below  any risk factor that could result in reduced earnings  liquidity or operating losses  could in turn adversely affect our ability to meet our liabilities or adversely affect the quoted market prices for our securities 
the cyclical nature of the commercial aerospace industry  which represents a significant portion of our business  creates uncertainty regarding our future profitability 
in addition  adverse changes to  or interruptions in  our relationships with our major commercial aerospace customers could reduce our revenues and impact our profitability and liquidity 
the commercial aerospace sector has a significant influence on titanium companies  particularly mill product producers 
the cyclical nature of the commercial aerospace sector has been the principal driver of the fluctuations in the performance of most titanium product producers 
our business is more dependent on commercial aerospace demand than is the overall titanium industry 
we shipped approximately of our mill products to commercial aerospace customers in  whereas we estimate approximately of the overall titanium industry s mill products were shipped to commercial aerospace customers in our melted and mill product sales to commercial aerospace customers accounted for of our total sales in  in and in we estimate that industry mill product shipments into the commercial aerospace sector will be higher than levels 
events that could adversely affect the commercial aerospace sector  such as future terrorist attacks  world health crises  a general economic downturn or unforeseen reductions in orders from commercial airlines  could significantly decrease our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
see business titanium industry commercial aerospace sector 
sales under ltas with customers in the commercial aerospace sector accounted for approximately of our total sales 
these ltas expire at various times beginning in through if we are unable to maintain our relationships with our major commercial aerospace customers  including boeing  rolls royce  safran  utc and wyman gordon  under the ltas we have with these customers  our sales could decrease substantially  negatively impacting our profitability 
see business customer agreements and business markets and customer base 
the titanium metals industry is highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete successfully 
the global titanium markets in which we operate are highly competitive 
competition is based on a number of factors  such as price  product quality and service 
some of our competitors may be able to drive down market prices because their costs are lower than our costs 
in addition  some of our competitors financial  technological and other resources may be greater than our resources  and such competitors may be better able to withstand changes in market conditions 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
further  consolidation of our competitors or customers in any of the industries in which we compete may result in reduced demand for our products 
in addition  producers of metal products  such as steel and aluminum  maintain forging  rolling and finishing facilities 
such facilities could be used or modified to process titanium mill products  which could lead to increased competition and decreased pricing for our titanium products 
in addition  many factors  including excess capacity resulting from reduced demand in the titanium industry  work to intensify the price competition for available business at low points in the business cycle 
our dependence upon certain critical raw materials that are subject to price and availability fluctuations could lead to increased costs or delays in the manufacture and sale of our products 
we rely on a limited number of suppliers around the world  and principally on those located in australia and south africa  for our supply of titanium containing rutile ore  one of the primary raw materials used in the production of titanium sponge 
while chlorine  another of the primary raw materials used in the production of titanium sponge  is generally widely available  we currently obtain our chlorine from a single supplier near our sponge plant in henderson 
also  we cannot supply all our needs for all grades of titanium sponge and scrap internally and are therefore dependent on third parties for a substantial portion of our raw material requirements 
all of our major competitors utilize sponge and scrap as raw materials in their melt operations 
titanium scrap is also used in certain steel making operations  and demand for these steel products  especially from china  also influences demand for titanium scrap 
purchase prices and availability of these critical materials are subject to volatility 
at any given time  we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of these critical materials on a timely basis  on price and other terms acceptable to us  or at all 
to help stabilize our supply of titanium sponge  we have entered into ltas with certain sponge suppliers that contain fixed annual supply obligations 
these ltas contain minimum annual purchase requirements and  in certain cases  include take or pay provisions which require us to pay penalties if we do not meet the minimum annual purchase requirements 
see business products and operations raw materials  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources contractual commitments and note to the consolidated financial statements 
although overall inflationary trends in recent years have been moderate  during the same period certain critical raw material costs in our industry  including titanium sponge and scrap  have been volatile 
while we are able to mitigate some of the adverse impact of fluctuating raw material costs through ltas with suppliers and customers  rapid increases in raw material costs may adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity 
we may be forced to decrease prices or may not be able to implement price increases 
we change prices on certain of our products from time to time 
prices for our products are dependent on market conditions  economic factors  raw material costs and availability  competitive factors  operating costs and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
pricing under our ltas  which were designed in part to limit price volatility to our customers and us  are generally revised on an annual basis  while changes in our raw material and other operating costs can occur throughout the year 
these factors may require us to reduce the prices we charge our customers  or they may limit our ability to implement price increases 
in some instances  we may realize cost savings in connection with the price reductions  but the cost savings may lag behind price reductions due to long manufacturing lead times and the terms of existing contracts  or the cost savings may not fully offset the impact of the price reductions 
in other instances  cost increases may precede the time at which we are able to implement a price increase  or the price increase may not fully offset the impact of the cost increases 
these factors have had in the past  and may have in the future  an adverse impact on our revenues  operating results  financial condition and liquidity 
our failure to develop new markets would result in our continued dependence on the cyclical commercial aerospace sector  and our operating results would  accordingly  remain cyclical 
in an effort to reduce dependence on the commercial aerospace market and to increase participation in other markets  we have devoted certain resources to developing new markets and applications for our products 
developing these emerging market applications involves substantial risk and uncertainties due to the fact that titanium must compete with less expensive alternative materials in these potential markets or applications 
we may not be successful in developing new markets or applications for our products  significant time may be required for such development and uncertainty exists as to the extent to which we will face competition in this regard 
because we are subject to environmental and worker safety laws and regulations  we may be required to remediate the environmental effects of our operations or take steps to modify our operations to comply with these laws and regulations  the costs of which could reduce our profitability 
various federal  state  local and foreign environmental and worker safety laws and regulations govern our operations 
throughout the history of our operations  we have used and manufactured  and currently use and manufacture  substantial quantities of substances that are considered hazardous  extremely hazardous or toxic under environmental and worker safety and health laws and regulations 
although we have substantial controls and procedures designed to reduce the risk of environmental  health and safety issues  we could incur substantial cleanup costs  fines and civil or criminal sanctions  third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations or liabilities under these laws or non compliance with environmental permits required at our facilities 
in addition  government environmental requirements or the enforcement thereof may become more stringent in the future 
some or all of these risks may result in liabilities that could reduce our profitability 
reductions in  or the complete elimination of  any or all tariffs on imported titanium products into the united states could lead to increased imports of foreign sponge  ingot  slab and mill products into the us and an increase in the amount of such products on the market generally  which could decrease pricing for our products 
in the us titanium market  the increasing presence of foreign participants has become a significant competitive factor  and  imports of titanium sponge  ingot and mill products  principally from russia and kazakhstan  have had a significant competitive impact on the us titanium industry 
generally  imports of titanium products into the us are subject to a normal trade relations tariff 
for tariff purposes  titanium products are broadly classified as either wrought billet  bar  sheet  strip  plate and tubing or unwrought sponge  ingot and slab 
from time to time  the us government has granted preferential trade status to certain titanium products imported from particular countries notably wrought titanium products from russia  which carried no us import duties from approximately until 
it is possible that such preferential status could be granted again in the future  and we may not be successful in resisting efforts to eliminate duties or tariffs on titanium products 
see trade and tariff discussion in business competition 
we may be unable to reach or maintain satisfactory collective bargaining agreements with unions representing a significant portion of our employees 
our production and maintenance workers in henderson and our production  maintenance  clerical and technical workers in toronto  are represented by the united steelworkers of america under contracts expiring in january and june  for the respective locations 
a majority of the salaried and hourly employees at our european facilities are represented by various european labor unions 
our labor agreement with our managerial and professional uk employees expires in march  and our labor agreement with our uk production and maintenance employees expires in december the agreements with our french and italian employees are renewed annually 
a prolonged labor dispute or work stoppage at our major production facilities could materially impact our operating results 
we may not succeed in concluding collective bargaining agreements with the unions on terms acceptable to us or maintaining satisfactory relations under existing collective bargaining agreements 
if our employees were to engage in a strike  work stoppage or other slowdown  we could experience a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs 
global climate change legislation could negatively impact our financial results or limit our ability to operate our business 
we operate production facilities in several countries  and we believe all of our worldwide production facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws 
in many of the countries in which we operate  legislation has been passed  or proposed legislation is being considered  to limit green house gases through various means  including emissions permits and or energy taxes 
in several of our production facilities  we consume large amounts of energy  including electricity and natural gas 
the permit system currently in effect in the various countries in which we operate has not had a material adverse effect on our financial results 
however  if green house gas legislation were to be enacted in one or more countries  it could negatively impact our future results of operations through increased costs of production  particularly as it relates to our energy requirements 
if such increased costs of production were to materialize  we may be unable to pass price increases onto our customers to compensate for those costs  which may decrease our liquidity  operating income and results of operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary general overview 
we are a vertically integrated producer of titanium sponge  melted products and a variety of mill products for commercial aerospace  military  industrial and other applications 
we are one of the world s leading producers of titanium melted products ingot  electrode and slab and mill products billet  bar  plate  sheet and strip 
we are the only producer with major titanium production facilities in both the united states and europe  the world s principal markets for titanium 
we are currently the largest us producer of titanium sponge  a key raw material 
we sell our titanium melted and mill products into four worldwide market sectors 
aggregate volumes for titanium mill products were shipped into the following sectors in timet titanium industry mill product shipments of total mill product shipments of total metric tons metric tons commercial aerospace military industrial emerging markets estimates based on our titanium industry experience and information obtained from publicly available external resources eg  united states geological survey  international titanium association and japan titanium society 
the titanium industry derives a substantial portion of its demand from the highly cyclical commercial aerospace sector 
as shown in the table above  our business is more dependent on commercial aerospace demand than is the overall titanium industry 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in the preparation of these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments  and select from a range of possible estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory allowances  asset lives  impairments of investments  the recoverability of other long lived assets  including property and equipment  pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and the related underlying actuarial assumptions  the realization of deferred income tax assets  and accruals for asset retirement obligations  environmental remediation  litigation  income tax and other contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments  to varying degrees  on historical experience  advice of external specialists and various other factors we believe to be prudent under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from previously estimated amounts and such estimates  assumptions and judgments are regularly subject to revision 
we consider the policies and estimates discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application requires our most significant judgments in estimating matters for financial reporting that are inherently uncertain 
see notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these policies and estimates  as well as discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates 
impairment of marketable securities 
we evaluate our investments whenever events or conditions occur to indicate that the fair value of such investments has declined below their carrying amounts 
if the carrying amount for an investment declines below its historical cost basis  we evaluate all available positive and negative evidence including  but not limited to  the extent and duration of the impairment  business prospects for the investee and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient for the recovery of fair value 
if we conclude the decline in fair value is other than temporary  the carrying amount of the investment is written down to fair value 
impairment of long lived assets 
generally  when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of our long lived property and equipment may not be recoverable  we undertake an evaluation of the assets or asset group 
such events or changes in circumstances include a current period operating or cash flow loss associated with the long lived asset combined with a history and or future forecast of operating or cash flow losses whether resulting from decreased demand or otherwise  a sustained period of time during which the operating results of the long lived asset were below expectations  a current expectation that it was more likely than not that the long lived asset would be sold or otherwise disposed before the end of its previously estimated useful life  a significant adverse change in the manner in which the long lived asset was being used or a significant decrease in the market price for the long lived asset 
if this evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group is not recoverable  the amount of the impairment would typically be calculated using discounted expected future cash flows or appraised values 
all relevant factors are considered in determining whether an impairment exists 
we did not evaluate any material long lived assets for impairment during  or because no such impairment indicators were present 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred taxes for future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a deferred income tax asset valuation allowance  it is possible that in the future we may change our estimate of the amount of the deferred income tax assets that would more likely than not be realized in the future 
if such changes take place  there is a risk that an adjustment to our deferred income tax asset valuation allowance may be required that would either increase or decrease  as applicable  our reported net income in the period such change in estimate was made 
for example  we have net operating loss carryforwards in the united kingdom the equivalent of million at december  
at december   we concluded that no deferred income tax asset valuation allowance is required to be recognized with respect to such carryforwards  principally because i such carryforwards have an indefinite carryforward period  ii we have utilized a portion of such carryforwards during the most recent three year period and iii we currently expect to utilize the remainder of such carryforwards over the long term 
however  prior to the complete utilization of these carryforwards  it is possible we might conclude the benefit of the carryforwards would no longer meet the more likely than not recognition criteria  at which point we would be required to recognize a valuation allowance against some or all of the then remaining tax benefit associated with the carryforwards 
at the end of each reporting period  we also evaluate whether some or all of the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested as that term is defined in generally accepted accounting principles 
while we may have concluded in the past that some undistributed earnings are permanently reinvested  facts and circumstances can change in the future  such as a change in the expectation regarding the capital needs of our foreign subsidiaries  which could result in a conclusion that some or all of the undistributed earnings are no longer permanently reinvested 
if our prior conclusions change  we would recognize a deferred income tax liability in an amount equal to the estimated incremental us income tax and withholding tax liability that would be generated if all of such previously considered permanently reinvested undistributed earnings were distributed to us 
we did not change our conclusions on our undistributed foreign earnings in we record reserves for uncertain tax positions where we believe it is more likely than not our position will not prevail with the applicable tax authorities 
from time to time  tax authorities will examine certain of our income tax returns 
tax authorities may interpret tax regulations differently than we do 
judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits and changes to or further interpretations of regulations  thereby resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount we are required to accrue for uncertain tax positions and therefore a decrease or increase in our reported net income in the period of such change 
our reserve for uncertain tax positions changed during see results of operations income taxes for discussion of our analysis of our deferred income tax valuation allowances and note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our uncertain tax positions 
pension and opeb expenses and obligations 
our pension and opeb expenses and obligations are calculated based on several estimates  including discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets 
we review these rates annually with the assistance of our actuaries 
see further discussion of the factors considered and potential effect of these estimates in liquidity and capital resources defined benefit pension plans and liquidity and capital resources postretirement benefit plans other than pensions 
results of operations comparison of to summarized financial information 
the following table summarizes certain information regarding our results of operations for the years ended december  and our reported average selling prices reflect actual selling prices after the effects of currency exchange rates  customer and product mix and other related factors throughout the periods presented

our net sales were million for compared to net sales of million for the increase in net sales was principally the result of increased volumes  partially offset by lower average selling prices during product shipment volume increased for melted products and for mill products from to  due to improved demand for certain titanium products within the commercial aerospace sector as manufacturing activity and inventory levels within the supply chain continued to recover 
average selling prices decreased for melted products and for mill products from to  primarily driven by pricing adjustments under long term customer agreements  lower spot market prices for our products and the relative mix of products sold during the period 
gross margin 
for  our gross margin was million as compared to million for  primarily reflecting a higher gross margin percentage relative to net sales 
our improved profitability reflects lower cost raw materials  principally titanium sponge and scrap  and the benefit of higher utilization of our production capacity  partially offset by lower average selling prices 
increased production rates throughout our major manufacturing operations during resulted in lower unabsorbed fixed overhead costs of million as compared to million in operating income 
our operating income for was million compared to million during  which was primarily the result of higher gross margin 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was in compared to in we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions  and as a result  the geographic mix of our pre tax income or loss can impact our overall effective tax rate 
our effective rate in was lower than the us statutory rate primarily due to the net effects of i the positive impact of a portion of earnings being generated in lower tax rate jurisdictions  ii the negative impact of certain uk tax legislation which was enacted in and became effective in and iii the positive impact of the domestic production activities deduction 
our effective income tax rate in was higher than the us statutory rate primarily due to the net effects of lower earnings  changes in foreign tax law that caused us to revise our judgments regarding our ability to utilize certain foreign tax attributes and incremental taxes on foreign earnings 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a tabular reconciliation of our statutory income tax expense to our actual tax expense 
some of the more significant items impacting this reconciliation are summarized below 
our income tax expense in includes an income tax benefit of million related to the domestic production activities deduction and related increase in the allowable percentage for our income tax expense in includes an income tax benefit of million related to an internal reorganization we implemented in the second quarter of  and an income tax expense of million related to an increase in our reserve for uncertain tax positions

our net sales were million for compared to net sales of  million for the decrease in net sales was principally the result of reduced volumes and  to a lesser extent  lower average selling prices in compared to product shipment volumes decreased for melted products and for mill products from to  as overall titanium demand declined due to the weak global economy throughout most of and the effects of production delays within the commercial aerospace sector during additionally  as a result of these production delays  we believe many of our customers implemented strategies to reduce excess inventories and to maximize operating cash flows 
average selling prices decreased for melted products and for mill products over these same periods due to competitive pricing pressures resulting from lower demand for titanium products and a decline in raw material costs  primarily titanium scrap 
the decline in raw material costs contributed to lower selling prices for certain products under long term customer agreements  in part due to raw material indexed pricing adjustments included in certain of these agreements 
gross margin 
for  our gross margin was million as compared to million for  primarily reflecting the effects of lower volumes and average selling prices for our melted and mill products 
due to low utilization of our production capacity  the favorable impacts on our gross margin from declining raw material costs  primarily titanium scrap  were largely offset by higher per unit overhead costs 
in addition  abnormally low production throughout our major manufacturing operations resulted in unabsorbed fixed overhead costs of million for operating income

during  we recognized other non operating income of million consisting primarily of million in foreign currency gains as the dollar strengthened against the pound sterling and the euro in the second half of and a million gain on sale of an investment discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was in compared to in our effective income tax rate for was higher than the us statutory rate  primarily due to the net effects of lower earnings  changes in foreign tax law that caused us to revise our judgments regarding our ability to utilize certain foreign tax attributes and incremental taxes on foreign earnings 
we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions  and as a result  the geographic mix of our pre tax income or loss can impact our overall effective tax rate 
our effective income tax rate in the period was lower than the us statutory rate due to the implementation of an internal corporate reorganization prior to see note to the consolidated financial statements for a tabular reconciliation of our statutory income tax expense to our actual tax expense 
some of the more significant items impacting this reconciliation are summarized below 
our income tax expense in includes an income tax benefit of million related to an internal reorganization we implemented in the second quarter of  and an income tax expense of million related to an increase in our reserve for uncertain tax positions 
our income tax expense in includes an income tax benefit of million related to an internal reorganization we implemented in the second quarter of  an income tax benefit of million related to the reversal of our deferred income tax asset valuation allowance related to our capital loss carryforward following the sale of an investment  and an income tax expense of million related to an increase in our reserve for uncertain tax positions 
european operations we have substantial operations located in the united kingdom  france and italy 
approximately of our sales originated in europe for  a portion of which were denominated in foreign currency  principally the british pound sterling or the euro 
certain raw material costs  principally purchases of titanium sponge and alloys for our european operations  are denominated in us dollars  while labor and other production costs are primarily denominated in local currencies 
the functional currencies of our european subsidiaries are those of their respective countries 
our european operations may incur borrowings denominated in us dollars or in their respective functional currencies 
our export sales from the us are denominated in us dollars and are not subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we do not use currency contracts to hedge our currency exposures 
the translated us dollar value of our foreign sales and operating results are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations which may favorably or adversely impact reported earnings and may affect the comparability of period to period operating results 
by applying the exchange rates prevailing during the prior year period to our local currency results of operations for the current year period  the translation impact of currency rate fluctuations can be estimated 
as the us dollar strengthened versus the british pound and the euro in compared to and remained relatively neutral to the british pound but strengthened versus the euro in compared to  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates had the following effects on our sales and operating income versus versus in millions increase decrease in net sales operating income outlook demand for our products has consistently improved throughout as customers  particularly in the commercial aerospace supply chain  right sized their inventory levels and prepared for increased output in and beyond 
our results reflect these improved industry conditions which we expect to continue through increases in our sales volumes for melted and mill products of and  respectively  together with our ongoing focus on cost control and manufacturing efficiency  contributed to the increase in operating income for the improvement in customer order trends that we experienced during has continued into our sales order backlog at the close of the year was higher than a year ago 
the combined effects of announced increases in build rates for certain commercial aircraft  together with the continued ramp up of next generation aircraft  contribute to the increasing demand trends that we expect for the year ahead 
we believe that the rate of increase in demand is likely to continue  fueled by the combined effects of recovery in commercial and military aircraft sales  as well as anticipated growth in industrial markets 
we believe our focus on titanium metals and specialty titanium alloys for the aerospace industry  especially for jet engine applications  continues to provide us with a competitive advantage in light of the favorable long term outlook for aerospace 
based on such factors  we currently expect overall volume growth for to be comparable with  with our production rates increasing accordingly 
we anticipate our average selling prices and unit costs will remain relatively consistent with  with some variability from product mix 
despite recent setbacks in several new commercial and military aircraft programs  the development and production of new generation aircraft  which require a significantly higher percentage of titanium than earlier models  and a strong backlog signal that our industry could be entering the sustained growth period that various industry experts have forecasted 
if the industry s estimated timelines for fleet replacement and commercial aircraft production are met  including boeing achieving its expected timeline for initial customer deliveries of the  we anticipate production rates throughout the commercial aerospace supply chain will continue to show improvement during the next year and accelerate over the next several years  which should positively affect our sales and operating results 
in january  the airline monitor  a leading aerospace publication  issued its semi annual forecast for commercial aircraft deliveries 
aggregate annual deliveries of aircraft for boeing and airbus are expected to reach record numbers during each year from through totaling at least  aircraft deliveries each year during the period 
even after the next expected peak in overall deliveries of boeing and airbus aircraft forecasted at  units in  the demand for titanium is expected to remain strong due to increased deliveries of twin aisle aircraft and the increased production rates of next generation commercial aircraft  both of which require large amounts of titanium 
beyond  projected aircraft deliveries remain strong as fuel efficiency and expansion of the global fleet in developing areas  such as asia  the middle east and south america  are expected to be key drivers of long term demand 
we continue to enhance our ability to meet our current and prospective customers needs and strengthen our position as a reliable supplier in markets where technical ability and precision are critical 
we have been successful over the last several years in establishing significant flexibility and cost advantages in our entire manufacturing process 
our fiscal discipline and industry experience have allowed us to manage our production rates and costs effectively while investing capital conservatively  maintain positive cash flows and a strong balance sheet  including million of cash  and remain debt free as of december  we believe our financial strength  flexibility in raw material sourcing and production capabilities position us to take advantage of new opportunities to strengthen and expand our presence in key markets 
liquidity and capital resources our consolidated cash flows for each of the past three years are presented below 
the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
year ended december  in millions cash used in provided by operating activities investing activities financing activities net cash used in provided by operating  investing and financing activities operating activities 
cash flow from operations is the primary source of our liquidity 
changes in pricing  production volume and customer demand  among other things  could significantly affect our liquidity 
cash provided by operating activities decreased million  from million in to million in the net effects of the following significant items contributed to the overall decrease in cash provided by operating activities operating income increased by million in  net cash used in operations resulting from changes in receivables  inventories  payables and accrued liabilities increased by million in in response to changing working capital requirements to support increased production levels in response to our sales growth  and net cash paid for income taxes increased by million in primarily due to higher taxable income in cash provided by operating activities increased million  from million in to million in the net effects of the following significant items contributed to the overall increase in cash provided by operating activities operating income declined by million in  net cash provided by operations resulting from changes in receivables  inventories  payables and accrued liabilities increased by million in in response to changing working capital requirements resulting primarily from declining inventory levels  and net cash paid for income taxes declined by million in primarily due to lower taxable income in relative changes in working capital can have significant effects on cash flows from operating activities 
as shown below  our average days sales outstanding dso increased from december  to december  the increase in our dso was the result of the general mix of customers and the timing of collection of receivables  especially with respect to as shown below  our average number of days sales in inventory dsi decreased from december  to december  the overall decrease in average dsi was the result of the timing of inventory purchases and our strong sales results during relative to the general economic outlook prevailing during based on our sales order backlog and outlook for inventory purchases  we expect to deploy additional working capital to maintain appropriate inventory levels in in response to improving customer demand trends 
for comparative purposes  we have also provided average dso and dsi for the comparative prior year periods in the table below december  december  december  dso days days days dsi days days days investing activities 
our investing activities used cash of million in and million in and provided cash of million in our capital expenditures were million during  million in and million in capital projects and other significant investing activities include the following during  we had construction underway for the first and second phases of our eb melt capacity expansion at our facility in morgantown and other capacity expansion projects in the us and europe 
capital spending in and was primarily limited to those projects required to properly maintain our equipment and facilities 
we purchased million in marketable equity securities during  million during and million during we entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with contran corporation during  pursuant to which we loaned contran an aggregate of million during and collected an aggregate of million during we received principal payments on notes receivable from compx international inc of million in  million in and nil in financing activities 
we had no net borrowing activity during  and other significant items included in our cash flows from financing activities included dividends paid on our common stock of million in in february  our board of directors decided to suspend our quarterly dividend after considering the current economic and financial environment  dividends paid to cezus of million in  million in and million in  and treasury stock purchases of million during  million in and million in future cash requirements liquidity 
our primary source of liquidity on an ongoing basis is our cash flows from operating activities and borrowing availability under various credit facilities 
we generally use these amounts to i fund capital expenditures  ii repay indebtedness incurred primarily for working capital purposes and iii provide for the payment of dividends 
from time to time we will incur indebtedness  generally to i fund short term working capital needs  ii refinance existing indebtedness  iii make investments in marketable and other securities including the acquisition of securities issued by our subsidiaries and affiliates or iv fund major capital expenditures or the acquisition of other assets outside the ordinary course of business 
we routinely evaluate our liquidity requirements  capital needs and availability of resources in view of  among other things  our alternative uses of capital  debt service requirements  the cost of debt and equity capital and estimated future operating cash flows 
as a result of this process  we have in the past and may in the future  seek to raise additional capital  modify our common and preferred dividend policies  restructure ownership interests  incur  refinance or restructure indebtedness  repurchase shares of common stock  sell assets  or take a combination of such steps or other steps to increase or manage our liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of business  we investigate  evaluate  discuss and engage in acquisition  joint venture  strategic relationship and other business combination opportunities in the titanium  specialty metal and other industries 
in the event of any future acquisition or joint venture opportunities  we may consider using then available liquidity  issuing equity securities or incurring indebtedness 
we paid four quarterly cash dividends of per share in in the first quarter of  our board of directors decided to suspend our quarterly dividend after considering the economic and financial environment 
we believe it is in our best interest to enhance our financial strength which will allow us to continue investing in our business and taking advantage of potential opportunities in our industry  including acquisitions  long term partnering agreements or joint ventures  if and when such strategic opportunities arise 
additionally  we will have the flexibility to repurchase shares of our common stock under our previously announced repurchase programs without sacrificing our ability to pursue other opportunities in our industry 
the declaration and payment of future dividends will be dependent upon the board s consideration of our cash requirements  contractual commitments  including applicable credit facility covenants  strategic plans and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
at december   we had aggregate cash and cash equivalents on hand of million and borrowing availability under our existing u 
s and european credit facilities of million  including million under our us facility 
however  our us facility expired in february  and based on our current and anticipated liquidity requirements  we do not currently plan to replace the us facility 
our uk credit facilities mature in august see note to the consolidated financial statements 
based upon our expectations of our operating performance  the anticipated demands on our cash resources  borrowing availability under our european credit facilities of million at december  and anticipated borrowing capacity after the maturity of these credit facilities  we expect to have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations for the short term defined as the next twelve month period and our long term obligations 
repurchases of common stock 
at february   we had approximately million available for repurchase of our common stock under the authorizations described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures 
we currently estimate we will invest a total of approximately million to million for capital expenditures during our planned capital expenditures are concentrated in areas that allow us to properly maintain equipment and drive increased operating efficiencies 
capital spending for is expected to be funded by cash flows from operating activities or existing cash resources and available credit facilities 
we continue to evaluate additional opportunities to improve or augment productive assets including capital projects  acquisitions or other investments which  if consummated  any required funding would be provided by existing cash resources or borrowings under our european credit facilities 
contractual commitments 
as more fully described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  we were a party to various agreements at december  that contractually commit us to pay certain amounts in the future 
the following table summarizes our contractual commitments that specify all significant terms  including pricing  quantity and date of payment payment due date after total in millions operating leases purchase obligations raw materials other other contractual obligations these obligations generally relate to the purchase of titanium sponge pursuant to ltas that expire at varying dates as described in item business and various other commitments for the purchase of raw materials 
certain ltas have annually negotiated prices and ranges of volumes  and we have assumed minimum required volumes and minimum or estimated prices  as deemed appropriate 
certain ltas contain automatic renewal provisions  however  we have only included the purchase commitments associated with the initial terms of each lta 
these obligations generally relate to contractual purchase obligations for conversion services  certain operating fees paid to cezus for use of a portion of its ugine plant pursuant to an agreement expiring in as described in item properties  obligations for the purchase of energy and utilities and other commitments for the purchase of various goods and services  including equipment and operating supplies  which are primarily for delivery in these obligations are generally based on an average price and an assumed constant mix of services purchased  as appropriate 
these other obligations include income taxes payable and other contractual obligations recorded on our balance sheet as of december  additionally  we have an obligation to contran under an intercorporate services agreement isa which will be recorded ratably over the service period 
we expect to renew the isa annually 
the above table does not reflect any amounts that we might pay to fund our defined benefit pension plans and opeb plans  as the timing and amount of any such future funding are unknown and dependent on  among other things  the future performance of defined benefit pension plan assets  interest rate assumptions and inflation rate assumptions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements and liquidity and capital resources defined benefit pension plans and liquidity and capital resources postretirement benefit plans other than pensions 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any off balance sheet financing agreements other than the outstanding letters of credit and operating leases discussed in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
defined benefit pension plans 
as of december   we maintain three defined benefit pension plans one each in the us  the us and france 
the majority of the discussion below relates to the us and uk plans  as the french plan is not material to our consolidated balance sheets  statements of income or statements of cash flows 
we recorded net consolidated pension expense of million in  million in and million in pension expense for these periods was calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return 
actual returns on plan assets during were significantly lower than our expected long term rate of return for both the us and us plans  and the resulting actuarial losses were recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci as of december  as these actuarial losses began amortizing during  pension expense increased during as compared to furthermore  our uk plan experienced an additional actuarial loss in primarily due to a decrease in our discount rate assumption and an increase in our inflation rate assumption  which further increased our pension expense in when this additional actuarial loss began to be amortized 
the discount rate we utilize for determining pension expense and pension obligations for our us plan is based on discount rates derived from our expected future cash flows  and the discount rate we utilize for determining pension expense and pension obligations for our uk plan is based on the yields available on high quality corporate bond indices over the same duration as the uk plan s expected future cash flows 
changes in our discount rate over the past three years reflect the fluctuations in such expected cash flows during that period 
we establish a rate that is used to determine obligations as of the year end date and expense or income for the subsequent year 
we used the following discount rate assumptions for our defined benefit pension plans discount rates used for obligation at december  and expense in obligation at december  and expense in obligation at december  and expense in us plan uk plan lowering the discount rate assumption by from to would have increased our us plan s pension expense by approximately million  and lowering the discount rate assumption by from to would have increased our uk plan s pension expense by approximately million 
benefit payments to participants in our uk plan are adjusted for inflation annually  impacting both pension expense and pension obligations 
the inflation rate we utilize for our uk plan is derived from the risk adjusted spread between fixed rate and variable rate uk government bond indices 
changes in our inflation rate over the past three years reflect the fluctuations in such indices during that period 
we establish a rate that is used to determine obligations as of the year end date and expense or income for the subsequent year 
we used the following inflation rate assumptions for our uk defined benefit pension plan inflation rates used for obligation at december  and expense in obligation at december  and expense in obligation at december  and expense in uk plan in developing our expected long term rate of return assumptions  we evaluate historical market rates of return and input from our actuaries  including a review of asset class return expectations as well as long term inflation assumptions 
projected returns are based on broad equity large cap  small cap and international and bond corporate and government indices as well as anticipation that the plans active investment managers will generate premiums above the standard market projections 
all of our us plan s assets are invested in the combined master retirement trust cmrt 
the cmrt is a collective investment trust sponsored by contran to permit the collective investment by certain master trusts which fund certain employee benefit plans sponsored by contran and related companies 
however  our us plan assets are invested only in the portion of the cmrt that does not hold our common stock 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the cmrt s long term investment objective is to provide a rate of return exceeding a composite of broad market equity and fixed income indices including the s p and certain russell indices utilizing both third party investment managers as well as investments directed by mr 
simmons 
mr 
simmons is the sole trustee of the cmrt 
the trustee of the cmrt  along with the cmrt s investment committee  of which mr 
simmons is a member  actively manages the investments of the cmrt 
the trustee and investment committee periodically change the asset mix of the cmrt based upon  among other things  advice from third party advisors and their respective expectations as to what asset mix will generate the greatest overall return 
at december   our portion of the cmrt had an aggregate asset value of million 
during  and  the assumed long term rate of return for our us plan assets that were invested in the cmrt was 
in determining the appropriateness of the long term rate of return assumption  we considered  among other things  the historical rates of return  the current and projected asset mix and the investment objectives of the cmrt s managers for our portion of the cmrt 
during the history of the cmrt from its inception in through december   the average annual rate of return earned by our portion of the cmrt  as calculated based on the average percentage change in the net asset value per unit for each applicable year  has been 
all of our uk plan s assets are invested in equity securities  fixed income securities and cash or cash equivalents with a target asset allocation determined by an investment committee appointed by the plan s trustee 
as a result of market fluctuations experienced and the strategic movement toward our long term funding and asset allocation strategies  actual asset allocation as of december  was equity securities and debt and other securities 
our future expected long term rate of return on plan assets for our uk plan is based on our target asset allocation assumption of equity securities and fixed income securities 
based on various factors  including economic and market conditions  gains on the plan assets during each of the preceding years and projected asset mix  our assumed long term rate of return for our pension expense was for  for and in although the expected rate of return is a long term measure  we continue to evaluate our expected rate of return annually and adjust it as considered necessary 
as part of this evaluation  we considered the historical long term average annual rates of return and recent economic downturn impacting virtually all global equity markets  and based on our evaluation  the recent declines in value for our plans assets are not indicative of a long term trend requiring an adjustment to our long term expected rate of return for any of our defined benefit pension plans 
actual returns on plan assets for a given year that are greater than the assumed rates of return result in an actuarial gain  while actual returns on plan assets for a given year that are less than the assumed rates of return result in an actuarial loss 
all of these actuarial gains and losses are not recognized in earnings currently  but instead are deferred as part of aoci and amortized into net income in the future as part of pension expense 
however  any actuarial gains generated in future periods reduce the negative amortization effect of any cumulative actuarial losses  while any actuarial losses generated in future periods reduce the favorable amortization effect of any cumulative actuarial gains 
we used the following long term rate of return assumptions for our defined benefit pension plans long term rates of return used for pension expense for the year ended december us plan uk plan lowering the expected long term rate of return on our us plan s assets by from to would have increased pension expense by approximately million  and lowering the expected long term rate of return on our uk plan s assets by from to would have increased pension expense by approximately million 
based on an expected rate of return on plan assets of  a discount rate of and various other assumptions  we estimate that our us plan will have pension expense of approximately million in as compared to million in a increase or decrease in the discount rate would decrease or increase estimated pension expense by approximately million in  respectively 
a increase or decrease in the long term rate of return would decrease or increase estimated pension expense by approximately million in  respectively 
pension expense for our us plan will decrease in as compared to  primarily as the result of a net actuarial gain recognized in aoci as of december  such net actuarial gain resulted from our actual rate of return on plan assets exceeding our expected rate of return during partially offset by the impact of lowering the discount rate from december  to december  nominally higher expected return on assets will also reduce pension expense in based on an expected rate of return on plan assets of  a discount rate of and various other assumptions including an exchange rate of  we estimate that pension expense for our uk plan will approximate million in compared to million in a increase or decrease in the discount rate would decrease or increase estimated pension expense by approximately million in  respectively 
a increase or decrease in the long term rate of return would decrease or increase estimated pension expense by approximately million in  respectively 
pension expense for our uk plan will decrease in as compared to  primarily for reasons similar to those discussed above regarding the expected decrease in pension expense for our us plan in as well as changes to certain key assumptions  including a reduction in the expected inflation rate 
we made no cash contributions in and and million in to our us plan and million in  million in and million in to our uk plan 
based upon the current funded status of the plans and the actuarial assumptions being used for  we believe that we will be required to make contributions of million to our us plan and million to our us plan in the recent global economic downturn negatively impacted the performance of each plans assets during  but the fair values of the plans assets recovered somewhat during and the fair value of the assets of the us plan was million at december   at december  and million at december   and the fair value of the assets of the uk plan was million at december   million at december  and million at december  the combination of actual investment returns  changing discount rates and changes in other assumptions has a significant effect on our funded plan status plan assets compared to projected benefit obligations 
our us plan was underfunded by million as of december   and investment returns reduced the underfunded status to million at december  the significant recovery to the global economic and financial markets increased investment returns which  together with our contributions  reduced the underfunded status of our us plan to million as of december  our uk plan was underfunded by million as of december   and several factors contributed to the net increase of the underfunded status to million as of december   including i an increase from the affects of a weakening dollar versus the pound sterling  ii a net increase from the affects of changes to our key assumptions  including a decrease to the discount rate and an increase to the inflation rate partially offset by an increase to the long term rate of return and iii a decrease from actual investment returns 
the significant recovery to the global economic and financial markets increased investment returns which  together with a reduction to our inflation rate and a strengthening dollar versus the pound sterling  reduced the underfunded status of our uk plan to million as of december  postretirement benefit plans other than pensions 
we provide limited opeb benefits to a portion of our us employees upon retirement 
we fund such opeb benefits as they are incurred  net of any retiree contributions 
we paid opeb benefits  net of retiree contributions  of million in each of  and we recorded consolidated opeb expense of million in  million in and million in opeb expense for these periods was calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  most significant of which are the discount rate and the expected long term health care trend rate 
beginning january   we amended the benefit formula and the funding methodology for the majority of our participants which significantly reduced the accumulated opeb obligation  resulting in a gain recognized in aoci as of december  as the favorable effect of the plan amendment began to be amortized during  our opeb expense decreased during as compared to the discount rate we utilize for determining opeb expense and opeb obligations is based on discount rates derived from our expected future cash flows 
changes in our discount rate over the past three years reflect the fluctuations in such expected cash flows during that period 
we establish a rate that is used to determine obligations as of the year end date and expense or income for the subsequent year 
we used the following discount rate assumptions for our opeb plan discount rates used for obligation at december  and expense in obligation at december  and expense in obligation at december  and expense in opeb plan lowering the discount rate assumption by from to would have had a nominal impact on our opeb expense 
based on the expected future cash flows for our opeb plan  we selected a discount rate of for our december  opeb obligations and for our opeb expense 
we estimate the expected long term health care trend rate based upon input from specialists in this area  as provided by our actuaries 
in estimating the health care trend rate  we consider industry trends  our actual healthcare cost experience and our future benefit structure 
for  we used a beginning health care trend rate of 
if the health care trend rate were increased or decreased by for each year  opeb expense for would have increased or decreased by approximately million  respectively 
due to the plan amendments discussed above  we revised our health care trend assumptions 
for our opeb obligations as of december  and our opeb expense  we are using a beginning health care trend rate of  which is projected to be reduced to an ultimate rate of in based on a discount rate of  a health care trend rate as discussed above and various other assumptions  we estimate that opeb expense will approximate million in compared to million in a increase or decrease in the discount rate would have a nominal impact on estimated opeb expense in a increase or decrease in the health care trend rate for each year would increase or decrease the estimated service and interest cost components of opeb expense by approximately million in  respectively 
based upon the actuarial assumptions being used in  we believe we will be required to pay opeb benefits of million in  net of retiree contributions 
opeb expense will increase in primarily as the result of the decreased discount rate assumption 
environmental matters 
see business regulatory and environmental matters in item and note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of environmental matters 
affiliate transactions 
corporations that may be deemed to be controlled by or affiliated with mr 
simmons sometimes engage in i intercorporate transactions such as guarantees  management and expense sharing arrangements  shared fee arrangements  joint ventures  partnerships  loans  options  advances of funds on open account  and sales  leases and exchanges of assets  including securities issued by both related and unrelated parties  and ii common investment and acquisition strategies  business combinations  reorganizations  recapitalizations  securities repurchases  and purchases and sales and other acquisitions and dispositions of subsidiaries  divisions or other business units  which transactions have involved both related and unrelated parties and have included transactions which resulted in the acquisition by one related party of a publicly held minority equity interest in another related party 
we continuously consider  review and evaluate such transactions  and we understand that contran and related entities consider  review and evaluate such transactions 
depending upon the business  tax and other objectives then relevant  it is possible that we might be a party to one or more such transactions in the future 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of certain related party transactions that we were a party to during  and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates 
if we utilize our borrowing capacity in the future  we would be exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates related to indebtedness 
we typically do not enter into interest rate swaps or other types of contracts in order to manage our interest rate market risk 
we had no outstanding bank indebtedness at december  and any borrowings accrue interest at variable rates  generally related to spreads over the lenders published base rates 
because our bank indebtedness reprices with changes in market interest rates  the carrying amount  if any  of such debt is believed to approximate fair value 
foreign currency exchange rates 
we are exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our international operations 
we do not enter into currency forward contracts to manage our foreign exchange market risk associated with receivables  payables or indebtedness denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the particular entity 
see results of operations european operations in item md a for further discussion 
commodity prices 
we are exposed to market risk arising from changes in commodity prices as a result of our long term purchase and supply agreements with certain suppliers and customers 
these agreements  which offer various fixed or formula determined pricing arrangements  effectively obligate us to bear i the risk of increased raw material and other costs to us that cannot be passed on to our customers through increased titanium product prices in whole or in part or ii the risk of decreasing raw material costs to our suppliers that are not passed on to us in the form of lower raw material prices 
however  our ability to offset increased material costs improved in the last several years  as many of our ltas now include price adjustments that take into account raw material  labor and energy cost fluctuations 
we do not engage in commodity hedging programs 
raw materials 
we are exposed to market risk arising from changes in availability and prices for our critical raw materials 
from time to time we enter into long term supply agreements for certain critical raw materials  including sponge  rutile and certain alloys  and we have long term agreements in place for the majority of our expected requirements for titanium sponge through we also have closed loop arrangements with certain of our customers for the purchase of titanium scrap  which provide certainty of supply and price stability 
we do not generally enter into long term supply agreements for all of our other critical raw material requirements 
we believe the risk of unavailability of our critical raw materials is low considering our existing ltas with our raw material suppliers and other sources available to us  and the risk of price variability for our critical raw materials will be somewhat mitigated by our ability to increase the prices charged to our customers as noted above 
securities prices 
as of december  and  we held certain marketable securities that are exposed to market risk due to changes in prices of the securities 
the aggregate market value of these equity securities was million at december  and million at december  the potential change in the aggregate market value of these securities  assuming a change in prices  would have been million at december  and million at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest bearing notes receivable 
we hold a note receivable from compx with a principal amount of million at december  and million at december  our note receivable accrues interest at variable rates  related to the spread over libor 
because our note receivable reprices with changes in market interest rates  the carrying amount of such note receivable is believed to approximate fair value 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
we hold two notes receivable from contran with a combined principal amount of million at december  and million at december  our notes receivable accrue interest at variable rates  related to the prime rate  or in some cases  a specified spread under the prime rate 
because interest rates of our notes receivable reprice with changes in market interest rates  the carrying amount of such notes receivable are believed to approximate fair value
