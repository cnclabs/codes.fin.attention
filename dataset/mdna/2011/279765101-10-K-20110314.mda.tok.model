we plan to structure our future agreements on the model we signed with other financial printers in which we receive minimum filings fees and or minimum conversions  however  we may on occasion sign contracts without minimums where we believe the relationship will not be material to our capacity or revenues  or where doing so would otherwise be advantageous to our interests

 unaudited revenue sources xbrl filings data and solutions subscriptions total liquidity and capital resources net cash used by operating activities was  for the year ended december  compared to cash provided by operating activities of  for the year ended december  this was primarily due to the increase in net loss for the year ended december  resulting from our increased investment in our xbrl filings business 
net cash used in investing activities was for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease for the year ended december  was due to  cash acquired in business combinations offset by a increase in capitalized product development costs and a 
table of contents increase in capital expenditures 
on november   we acquired ubmatrix and received  of which   related to the issuance of series c preferred stock 
as part of the consideration for ubmatrix  we issued  shares of preferred stock which are convertible by dividing the purchase price per share plus accrued dividends by a conversion price of per share 
under certain conditions  we may be required to redeem all or part of the series c preferred shares at fair value see note  redeemable preferred stock of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december  compared to net cash used of for the year ended december  on january  we issued  shares of our series b preferred stock for  offset by fees incurred of generally  each series b preferred share is convertible into shares of our common stock determined by dividing the purchase price per share plus accrued dividends by a conversion price of per share 
under certain conditions  we may be required to redeem all or part of the series b preferred shares at fair value see note  redeemable preferred stock of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
we expect to use a substantial portion of the proceeds from the issuance to support investment in personnel  infrastructure  training and other costs related to our xbrl filings business 
we are party to a financing agreement with rosenthal and rosenthal  inc rosenthal for additional working capital 
under the financing agreement  rosenthal made a term loan in the original principal amount of  to us and has provided a revolving line of credit of up to  the entire amount of which would have been available to us at december  in accordance with the provisions of the agreement 
interest on outstanding borrowings under the financing agreement is payable at variable rates of interest over the published jpmorgan chase prime rate with a minimum prime rate of  on the term loan and on borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
our obligations under the term loan are evidenced by a secured term note and are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets 
we are required to maintain certain collateral ratios and financial covenants under the agreement  as amended 
we were in compliance with these ratios and covenants  as amended  at december  at december  we had sufficient cash to repay the outstanding indebtedness under the term loan 
the financing agreement  as amended  terminates on march  unless sooner terminated by either party in accordance with the terms of the financing agreement and the full outstanding indebtedness is payable on that date 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents on hand of  we have no off balance sheet arrangements at december  we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for funding working capital needs  capital expenditures and debt obligations for at least the next months 
thereafter  if the remaining cash from the proceeds from our series b preferred stock issuance and ubmatrix acquisition and cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that such additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
the failure to raise capital when needed could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition

our future contractual obligations  including variable rate debt and interest estimated at  at december  were as follows payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt  including interest operating lease obligations severance agreements total 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  estimated useful lives of intangible assets and the determination of restructuring obligations 
we base our estimates on historical experience  business practices and corporate policies  contractual provisions and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we derive revenues from three primary sources xbrl processing fees  fees for data and solutions and fees for subscriptions to our web services 
we recognize xbrl filings revenue from fixed fees on a ratable basis as well as per filing fees as the services are provided 
revenue from data licenses is recognized over the term of the underlying contracts 
our data solutions sometimes involve upfront one time customization fees along with more traditional data licensing arrangements for the ongoing delivery of the data solution 
in addition  some of our data solutions are billed on a time and materials basis  per service level agreements or for delivery of data 
upfront customization fees are recognized systematically over the expected customer relationship period 
revenue from time and materials based agreements and data delivery is recognized as the services and data are provided 
revenue from subscriptions is recognized ratably over the subscription period  which is typically twelve months 
subscriptions revenue also includes ancillary advertising and e commerce revenue which are recognized as the services are provided 
revenue is recognized provided acceptance and delivery  if applicable  has occurred  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and no significant obligations remain 
if amounts are received in advance of the services being performed  the amounts are recorded and presented as deferred revenues 
revenue is recognized net of any related state sales taxes charged and sales taxes payable are included in accrued expenses 
several of our accounting policies involve significant judgments and uncertainties 
the policies with the greatest potential effect on our results of operations and financial position include the estimated collectability of accounts receivable  the estimated useful lives and fair values of intangible assets and the estimated fair value of goodwill 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make payments and for sales allowances 
if the financial conditions of our customers deteriorate or there are specific factors resulting from the specific type of product  or customer class inability to make payments  additional allowances will be required 
we establish the estimated useful lives of our intangible assets based on a number of factors  which is in part based on our assessments of the technology and customer relationships acquired 
if these estimates change  the estimated useful lives of our intangibles may require adjustment 
we test goodwill annually and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
our evaluation is based primarily on market capitalization as we have only one reporting unit 
subsequent reviews may result in future periodic impairments that could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in the period recognized 
we recognize compensation expense for all employee and director stock based compensation awards based on estimated grant date fair values 
we estimate the fair value using the black scholes valuation model which requires us to make assumptions about the expected life of options  stock price volatility  risk free interest rates and dividend yields 
we recognize the expense on a straight line basis over the applicable vesting period 
fasb asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
upon adopting fasb asc  we estimated expected forfeitures over the life of each individual award and included the impact of these expected forfeitures in stock based compensation expense 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued asu  which contains updated accounting guidance to clarify the acquisition date that should be used for reporting pro forma financial information when comparative financial statements are issued 
this update requires that a company should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
this update also requires disclosure of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments 
the provisions of this update  which are to be applied prospectively  are effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december   with early adoption permitted 
the impact of this update on our consolidated financial statements will depend on the size and nature of future business combinations 
during october  the fasb issued asu which amended guidance contained within asc topic related to revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements 
the amendments in this update establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
these amendments also will replace the term fair value in the revenue allocation guidance with selling price to clarify that the allocation of revenue is based on entity specific assumptions rather than assumptions of a marketplace participant 
the guidance in this update will require that a vendor determine its best estimate of selling price in a manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis 
the amendments in this update will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  the provisions are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate fluctuations we generally invest in short term  low risk instruments 
we believe that any change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial statements 
we experience changes in interest expense when market interest rates change as interest on our debt is calculated as over the published jpmorgan chase prime rate  with a minimum prime rate of 
we believe that any change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial statements 
currency rate fluctuations our results of operations  financial position and cash flows are not materially affected by changes in the relative values of non us currencies to the us dollar 
we do not use any derivative financial instruments
