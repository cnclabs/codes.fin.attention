risk factors you should carefully consider the risk factors described below  as well as the other information included in this annual report on form k 
our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any or all of these risks  or by other risks or uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial  that may adversely affect us in the future 
economic weakness and uncertainty in the united states  in the regions in which we operate and in key advertising categories has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our advertising revenues 
advertising spending  which drives a significant portion of our revenues  is sensitive to economic conditions 
national and local economic conditions  particularly in the new york city and boston metropolitan regions  as well as in florida  affect the levels of our national  retail and classified advertising revenue 
economic factors that have adversely affected advertising revenue include lower consumer and business spending  high unemployment  depressed home sales and other challenges affecting the economy 
our advertising revenues are particularly adversely affected if advertisers respond to weak economic conditions by reducing their budgets or shifting spending patterns or priorities  or if they are forced to consolidate or cease operations 
continuing weak economic conditions and outlook would adversely affect our level of advertising revenues and our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risk factors the new york times company p 

table of contents all of our businesses face substantial competition for advertisers 
we face substantial competition for advertising revenue in our various markets from free and paid newspapers  magazines  web sites  digital platforms and applications  television  radio  other forms of media  direct marketing and online advertising networks and exchanges 
competition for advertising is generally based on audience levels and demographics  price  service and advertising results 
it has intensified both as a result of the continued development and fragmentation of digital media and adverse economic conditions 
competition from all of these media and services affects our ability to attract and retain advertisers and consumers and to maintain or increase our advertising rates 
the increasing popularity of digital media and the shift in consumer habits and advertising expenditures from traditional to digital media has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our revenues 
web sites  applications for mobile devices  social networking tools and other digital platforms distributing news and other content continue to gain popularity 
this migration to digital technologies among both providers and consumers of content may accelerate due to economic conditions with companies seeking greater efficiencies and consumers seeking more value and lower cost alternatives 
as a result  print subscriptions may decline and advertising spending may continue to shift from traditional media forms to digital media 
we expect that advertisers will continue to allocate increasing portions of their budgets to digital media  which through pay for performance and keyword targeted advertising can offer more measurable returns than traditional print media 
this secular shift has intensified competition for advertising in traditional media and has contributed to and may continue to contribute to a decline in print advertising revenue 
we may not achieve sufficient subscribers or audience levels to make a digital pay model financially attractive 
in early  we plan to launch a pay model on nytimes 
com and across digital platforms with the intention of developing a second digital revenue stream  while preserving our digital advertising business 
the times will implement a metered model  whereby users will be asked to pay after accessing for free a set number of articles per month 
our ability to build a subscriber base on our digital platforms depends on market acceptance  consumer habits  the timely development of an adequate online infrastructure  practices of delivery platforms and other factors 
traffic levels may stagnate or decline as a result of the implementation of a pay model  which may adversely affect our advertiser base and advertising rates and result in a decline in digital revenues 
if we are unable to convert a sufficient number of users to a paid status or maintain our digital audience for advertising sales  our business  financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected 
if we are unable to retain and grow our digital audience  our digital businesses will be adversely affected 
the increasing number of digital media options available on the internet  through social networking tools and through mobile and other devices distributing news and other content is expanding consumer choice significantly 
faced with a multitude of media choices and a dramatic increase in accessible information  consumers may place greater value on when  where and how and at what price they consume digital content than they do on the source or reliability of such content 
the increasing popularity of news aggregation web sites and customized news feeds often free to users may reduce our traffic levels by creating a disincentive for the audience to visit our web sites or use our digital applications 
in addition  the undifferentiated presentation of some of our content in aggregation with other content may lead audiences to fail to distinguish our content from the content of other providers 
our reputations for quality journalism and content are important in competing for revenues in this environment and are based on consumer and advertiser perceptions 
if consumers fail to differentiate our content from other content providers in digital media  or if the quality of our journalism or content is perceived as less reliable  we may not be able to increase our online traffic sufficiently or retain a base of frequent visitors to our digital platforms 
p 
annual report risk factors 
table of contents online traffic is also driven by internet search results  including search results provided by google  the primary search engine directing traffic to the web sites of the about group and many of our other sites 
search engines frequently update and change the methods for directing search queries to web pages or change methodologies or metrics for valuing the quality and performance of internet traffic on delivering cost per click advertisements 
any such changes could decrease the amount of revenue that we generate from online advertisements 
the failure to successfully manage search engine optimization efforts across our businesses could result in a significant decrease in traffic to our various web sites  which could result in substantial decreases in conversion rates and repeat business  as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic  any or all of which would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if traffic levels stagnate or decline  we may not be able to create sufficient advertiser interest in our digital businesses or to maintain or increase the advertising rates of the inventory on our digital platforms 
even if we maintain traffic levels  the market position of our brands may not be enough to counteract a significant downward pressure on advertising rates as a result of a significant increase in inventory 
the about group depends upon arrangements with google  and any changes in this relationship could adversely affect its business  financial condition and results of operations 
cost per click revenue of the about group is principally derived from an arrangement with google 
if the about group is unable to renew the existing agreement with google  the about group s business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
in addition  the amount of revenue we receive from google depends upon a number of factors outside of our control  including the efficiency of google s system in attracting advertisers and serving up paid listings on our content pages and judgments made by google about the relative attractiveness to the advertiser of clicks on paid listings on our web pages 
changes to google s paid listings network efficiency or its judgment about the relative attractiveness of clicks on paid listings on our web pages has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on the about group s business  financial condition and results of operations 
to remain competitive  we must be able to respond to and capitalize on changes in technology  services and standards and changes in consumer behavior 
technological developments in the media industry continue to evolve rapidly 
advances in that technology have led to an increasing number of alternative methods for the delivery of news and other content and have driven consumer demand and expectations in unanticipated directions 
if we are unable to exploit new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors or adapt to new distribution methods that provide optimal user experiences  our business  financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected 
technological developments also pose other challenges that could adversely affect our revenues and competitive position 
new delivery platforms may lead to pricing restrictions  the loss of distribution control and the loss of a direct relationship with consumers 
we may also be adversely affected if the use of technology developed to block the display of advertising on web sites proliferates 
technological developments and any changes we make to our business model may require significant capital investments 
we may be limited in our ability to invest funds and resources in digital products  services or opportunities and we may incur costs of research and development in building and maintaining the necessary and continually evolving technology infrastructure 
it may also be difficult to attract and retain talent for critical positions 
some of our existing competitors and possible additional entrants may have greater operational  financial and other resources or may otherwise be better positioned to compete for opportunities and as a result  our digital businesses may be less successful 
risk factors the new york times company p 

table of contents decreases in circulation volume adversely affect our circulation and advertising revenues 
advertising and circulation revenues are affected by circulation and readership levels of our newspaper properties 
competition for circulation and readership is generally based upon format  content  quality  service  timeliness and price 
in recent years  our newspaper properties  and the newspaper industry as a whole  have experienced declining print circulation volume 
this is due to  among other factors  increased competition from new digital media formats and sources other than traditional newspapers often free to users  declining discretionary spending by consumers affected by weak economic conditions  high subscription and newsstand rates  and a growing preference among some consumers to receive all or a portion of their news other than from a newspaper 
we have also experienced volume declines as a result of our strategy to implement circulation price increases at many of our newspaper properties and to focus on individually paid circulation that is preferred by advertisers 
if these or other factors result in a prolonged decline in circulation volume  the rate and volume of advertising revenues may be adversely affected as rates reflect circulation and readership  among other factors 
these factors could also affect our ability to institute circulation price increases for our print products at a rate sufficient to offset circulation volume declines 
if we are unable to execute cost control measures successfully  our total operating costs may be greater than expected  which may adversely affect our profitability 
we have significantly reduced operating costs by reducing staff and employee benefits and implementing general cost control measures across the company  and expect to continue these cost control efforts 
if we do not achieve expected savings or our operating costs increase as a result of our strategic initiatives  our total operating costs may be greater than anticipated 
in addition  if our cost reduction strategy is not managed properly  such efforts may affect the quality of our products and our ability to generate future revenue 
reductions in staff and employee compensation and benefits could also adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key employees 
significant portions of our expenses are fixed costs that neither increase nor decrease proportionately with revenues 
if we are not able to implement further cost control efforts or reduce our fixed costs sufficiently in response to a decline in our revenues  we may experience a higher percentage decline in our income from continuing operations 
a significant increase in the price of newsprint  or limited availability of newsprint supply  would have an adverse effect on our operating results 
the cost of raw materials  of which newsprint is the major component  represented approximately of our total operating costs in the price of newsprint has historically been volatile and may increase as a result of various factors  including a reduction in the number of suppliers as a result of restructurings and consolidations in the north american newsprint industry  declining newsprint supply as a result of paper mill closures and conversions to other grades of paper  and other factors that adversely impact supplier profitability  including increases in operating expenses caused by raw material and energy costs  and a rise in the value of the canadian dollar  which adversely affects canadian suppliers whose costs are incurred in canadian dollars but whose newsprint sales are priced in us dollars 
in addition  we rely on our suppliers for deliveries of newsprint 
the availability of our newsprint supply may be affected by various factors  including strikes and other disruptions that may affect deliveries of newsprint 
if newsprint prices increase significantly or we experience significant disruptions in the availability of our newsprint supply in the future  our operating results will be adversely affected

annual report risk factors 
table of contents sustained increases in costs of providing pension and employee health and welfare benefits and the underfunded status of our pension plans may adversely affect our operations  financial condition and liquidity 
employee benefits  including pension expense  accounted for approximately of our total operating costs in our profitability is significantly impacted by increases in these costs that may be due to factors beyond our control  including interest rates and returns on plan assets  which affect our pension expense and may increase our funding obligations 
our qualified pension plans were underfunded as of the january   valuation date and we expect to make substantial contributions in the future to fund this deficiency 
if interest rates decrease or investment returns are below expectations  those contributions may be higher than currently anticipated 
as a result  we may have less cash available for working capital and other corporate uses  which may have an adverse impact on our operations  financial condition and liquidity 
a significant number of our employees are unionized  and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if labor negotiations or contracts were to further restrict our ability to maximize the efficiency of our operations 
approximately of our full time equivalent work force are unionized 
as a result  we are required to negotiate the wages  salaries  benefits  staffing levels and other terms with many of our employees collectively 
our results could be adversely affected if future labor negotiations or contracts were to further restrict our ability to maximize the efficiency of our operations 
if we were to experience labor unrest  strikes or other business interruptions in connection with labor negotiations or otherwise  or if we are unable to negotiate labor contracts on reasonable terms  our ability to produce and deliver our most significant products could be impaired 
in addition  our ability to make short term adjustments to control compensation and benefits costs  rebalance our portfolio of businesses or otherwise adapt to changing business needs may be limited by the terms of our collective bargaining agreements 
due to our participation in multiemployer pension plans  we have exposures under those plans that may extend beyond what our obligations would be with respect to our employees 
we participate in  and make periodic contributions to  various multiemployer pension plans that cover many of our union employees 
our required contributions to these funds could increase because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of the insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these funds  inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability  low interest rates  lower than expected returns on pension fund assets or other funding deficiencies 
we incurred significant pension withdrawal liabilities in in connection with amendments to various collective bargaining agreements affecting certain multiemployer pension plans  primarily at the globe  and the closure of city suburban delivery systems  inc city suburban  our retail and newsstand distribution subsidiary  which resulted in the partial or complete cessation of contributions to certain multiemployer plans 
we may be required to make additional contributions under applicable law with respect to those plans or other multiemployer pension plans from which we may withdraw or partially withdraw 
our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer pension plan will depend on the extent of that plan s funding of vested benefits 
if a multiemployer pension plan in which we participate has significant underfunded liabilities  such underfunding will increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability 
we may buy or sell different properties as a result of our evaluation of our portfolio of businesses 
such acquisitions or divestitures would affect our costs  revenues  profitability and financial position 
from time to time  we evaluate the various components of our portfolio of businesses and may  as a result  buy or sell different properties 
these acquisitions or divestitures affect our costs  revenues  profitability and financial position 
we may also consider the acquisition of specific properties or businesses that fall outside our traditional lines of business if we deem such properties sufficiently attractive 
risk factors the new york times company p 

table of contents divestitures have inherent risks  including possible delays in closing transactions including potential difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals  the risk of lower than expected sales proceeds for the divested businesses  unexpected costs associated with the separation of the business to be sold from our integrated information technology systems and other operating systems  and potential post closing claims for indemnification 
in addition  adverse economic or market conditions may result in fewer potential bidders and unsuccessful sales efforts 
expected cost savings  which are offset by revenue losses from divested businesses  may also be difficult to achieve or maximize due to our fixed cost structure 
acquisitions also involve risks  including difficulties in integrating acquired operations  diversions of management resources  debt incurred in financing these acquisitions including the related possible reduction in our credit ratings and increase in our cost of borrowing  differing levels of management and internal control effectiveness at the acquired entities and other unanticipated problems and liabilities 
competition for certain types of acquisitions  particularly digital properties  is significant 
even if successfully negotiated  closed and integrated  certain acquisitions or investments may prove not to advance our business strategy and may fall short of expected return on investment targets 
from time to time  we make noncontrolling minority investments in private entities and these investments may be subject to capital calls 
we may have limited voting rights or an inability to influence the direction of such entities  although income from such investments may represent a significant portion of our income 
therefore  the success of these ventures may be dependent upon the efforts of our partners  fellow investors and licensees 
these investments are generally illiquid  and the absence of a market inhibits our ability to dispose of them 
this inhibition as well as an inability to control the timing or process relating to a disposition could adversely affect our liquidity and the value we may ultimately attain on a disposition 
if the value of the companies in which we invest declines  we may be required to record a charge to earnings 
our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business 
our debt agreements contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions 
for example  these covenants  among other things  restrict  subject to certain exceptions  our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur or guarantee additional debt or issue certain preferred equity  pay dividends on or make distributions to holders of our common stock or make other restricted payments  sell certain assets  create or incur liens on certain assets to secure debt  make certain investments  consolidate  merge  sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets  or enter into certain transactions with affiliates 
these restrictions limit our flexibility in operating our business and responding to opportunities 
changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity  increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options 
our long term debt is currently rated below investment grade by standard poor s and moody s investors service 
if our credit ratings remain below investment grade or are lowered further  borrowing costs for future long term debt or short term borrowing facilities may increase and our financing options  including our access to the unsecured borrowing market  would be more limited 
we may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility 
in addition  macroeconomic conditions  such as continued or increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets  would adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt or obtain additional financing to support operations or to fund new acquisitions or capital intensive internal initiatives

annual report risk factors 
table of contents we may be required to record non cash impairment charges with respect to certain of our assets 
each year  we evaluate the various components of our portfolio in connection with annual impairment testing 
we also continually evaluate whether current factors or indicators require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets  as well as other investments and other long lived assets 
we may be required to record a non cash charge if the financial statement carrying value of an asset is in excess of its estimated fair value 
fair value could be adversely affected by weak economic or market conditions within our industry that may have an adverse impact on our cash flows or our stock price 
an impairment charge would adversely affect our reported earnings 
we may not be able to protect intellectual property rights upon which our business relies  and if we lose intellectual property protection  our assets may lose value 
our business depends on our intellectual property  including our valuable brands  content  services and internally developed technology 
we believe our proprietary trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to our continued success and our competitive position 
unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our content  services  technology and other intellectual property  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will prevent any misappropriation or confusion among consumers and merchants  or unauthorized use of these rights 
advancements in technology have exacerbated the risk by making it easier to duplicate and disseminate content 
in addition  as our business and the risk of misappropriation of our intellectual property rights have become more global in scope  we may not be able to protect our proprietary rights in a cost effective manner in a multitude of jurisdictions with varying laws 
if we are unable to procure  protect and enforce our intellectual property rights  we may not realize the full value of these assets  and our business may suffer 
if we must litigate in the united states or elsewhere to enforce our intellectual property rights or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  such litigation may be costly and divert the attention of our management 
our class b common stock is principally held by descendants of adolph s

our class b common stock is principally held by descendants of adolph s

as a result  the trust has the ability to elect of the board of directors and to direct the outcome of any matter that does not require a vote of the class a common stock 
under the terms of the trust agreement  the trustees are directed to retain the class b common stock held in trust and to vote such stock against any merger  sale of assets or other transaction pursuant to which control of the times passes from the trustees  unless they determine that the primary objective of the trust can be achieved better by the implementation of such transaction 
because this concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger  takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our businesses  the market price of our class a common stock could be adversely affected 
legislative and regulatory developments may result in increased costs and lower advertising revenue from our digital businesses 
all of our operations are subject to government regulation in the jurisdictions in which they operate

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated financial condition as of december   and results of operations for the three years ended december  this item should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report 
executive overview we are a diversified media company that currently includes newspapers  digital businesses  investments in paper mills and other investments 
we classify our businesses based on our operating strategies into two reportable segments  the news media group and the about group 
the news media group consists of the following divisions the new york times media group  which includes the times  the iht  nytimes 
com and related businesses  the new england media group  which includes the globe  boston 
com  the t g  telegram 
com and related businesses  and the regional media group  which includes daily newspapers in alabama  california  florida  louisiana  north carolina and south carolina  their web sites  other print publications and related businesses 
the about group consists of about

our revenues were billion in the percentage of revenues contributed by division is below 
logo news media group the news media group generates revenues principally from print and digital advertising and through circulation 
other revenues  primarily consist of revenues from news services syndication  commercial printing  rental income and digital archives 
the news media group s main operating costs are employee related costs and raw materials  primarily newsprint 
news media group revenues in by category and percentage share are below

annual report management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
table of contents about group the about group generates revenues through cost per click advertising sponsored links for which the about group is paid when a user clicks on the ad  display advertising and e commerce including sales lead generation 
almost all of its revenues in are derived from the sale of cost per click and display advertising 
cost per click advertising accounted for of the about group s total advertising revenues in the about group s main operating costs are employee related costs and content and hosting costs 
joint ventures our investments accounted for under the equity method are as follows a interest in metro boston  which publishes a free daily newspaper in the greater boston area  a interest in a canadian newsprint company  malbaie  a interest in a partnership  madison  operating a supercalendered paper mill in maine  a interest in quadrantone  an online advertising network that sells bundled premium  targeted display advertising onto local newspaper and other web sites  and a interest in new england sports ventures  doing business as fenway sports group  which owns the boston red sox baseball club  liverpool football club a soccer team in the english premier league  approximately of new england sports network a regional cable sports network that televises the red sox and boston bruins hockey games  and of roush fenway racing a leading nascar team 
in the second quarter of  we sold of our units in fenway sports group  and we are exploring the sale of our remaining units  in whole or in parts 
business environment we believe that a number of factors and industry trends have had  and will continue to have  an adverse effect on our business and prospects 
these include the following economic conditions the challenging business environment in adversely affected our advertising revenues 
advertising spending  which drives a significant portion of our revenues  is susceptible to economic conditions 
advertising revenue trends improved in with the rate of decline in print advertising revenues moderating compared with  as encouraging signs of improvement were seen in the overall economy 
weak national and local economic conditions  particularly in the new york city and boston metropolitan regions  affect the levels of our national  classified and retail advertising revenue 
changes in spending patterns and priorities  including shifts in marketing strategies and budget cuts of key advertisers  in response to weak economic conditions  have depressed and may continue to depress our advertising revenue 
secular shift to digital media choices the competition for advertising revenue in various markets has intensified as a result of the continued development of digital media technologies 
we expect that technological developments will continue to favor digital media choices  adding to the challenges posed by audience fragmentation 
we have expanded and will continue to expand our digital offerings  however  most of our revenues are currently from traditional print products where advertising revenues are declining 
we believe that the shift from traditional media forms to a growing number of digital media choices has contributed to  and may continue to contribute to  a decline in print advertising 
in digital advertising  the marketplace has experienced significant downward pressure on advertising rates as a result of significant increases in inventory 
as the advertising climate remains challenged  media companies have been re evaluating their business models  with some moving towards various forms of digital pay models that will depend on greater market acceptance and a shift in consumer attitudes 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the new york times company p 

table of contents circulation circulation is another significant source of revenue for us 
circulation revenues are affected by circulation and readership levels 
in recent years  our newspaper properties  and the newspaper industry as a whole  have experienced declining print circulation volume 
this is due to  among other factors  increased competition from new digital formats and sources other than traditional newspapers often free to users  declining discretionary spending by consumers  higher subscription and newsstand rates and a growing preference among some consumers for receiving all or a portion of their news from a variety of sources 
costs a significant portion of our costs are fixed costs and therefore we are limited in our ability to reduce costs in the short term 
our most significant costs are employee related costs and raw materials  which together accounted for approximately of our total operating costs in changes in employee related costs and the price and availability of newsprint can materially affect our operating results 
for a discussion of these and other factors that could affect our results of operations and financial condition  see forward looking statements and item a risk factors 
our strategy our results in reflect our ability to manage the business during a period of transformation for our industry and amidst uneven economic conditions 
we anticipate that the challenges we currently face will continue  and we believe that the following elements are key to our efforts to address them 
extending the reach of our brands because of our high quality content  we believe we have very powerful and trusted brands that attract educated  affluent and influential audiences 
we are addressing the increasingly fragmented media landscape by building on the strength of our brands  particularly the times 
we have significantly expanded our presence on new digital platforms and added new tools and multimedia features across our properties 
to better serve the distinct audiences of the globe and boston 
com  the globe also plans to extend its reach by launching a new paid subscription site  bostonglobe 
com  in the second half of strengthening our digital businesses our goal is to grow our digital businesses by broadening our audiences  deepening engagement and monetizing the usage of our web sites 
we are pursuing a multiplatform strategy across our company with new digital products and new platforms  such as mobile  social media networks and reader application products

diversifying our revenue streams as the advertising marketplace changes  we plan to continue to diversify our revenue streams to make us less susceptible to the inevitable economic cycles and to respond to the secular changes in our industry 
in response  we have sought to strengthen our national advertising presence at the times 
in  approximately of the news media group s advertising revenues were from national advertising

we have also announced plans to launch a pay model for a new paid subscription web site  bostonglobe 
com  in the second half of as our news and information are being featured in an increasingly broad range of platforms and devices  we will continue to examine our circulation pricing in coordination with our overall multiplatform strategy to reflect the extended reach of our content 
restructuring our cost base over the past few years  we have focused on realigning our cost base to ensure that we are operating our businesses as efficiently as possible  while maintaining the quality of our journalism and achieving our long term strategy 
we took significant actions in to re engineer our cost base  which led to a million reduction in operating costs in while expense control efforts have become more challenging as we have cycled past those actions  we reduced our operating costs by approximately million in while we expect higher newsprint prices and pension expense  we remain focused on managing our expenses to identify further efficiencies in our operations and to respond to the secular changes in our industry 
managing our portfolio of businesses over the past several years  we have been managing our portfolio of businesses  focusing more on growth areas  such as digital 
we also continue to evaluate our businesses to determine whether they are meeting our targets for financial performance  growth and return on investment and whether they remain relevant to our strategy 
managing our pension related obligations the funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans has been adversely affected by the current interest rate environment and required contributions for our qualified pension plans can have a significant impact on future cash flows 
for purposes of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  we estimated that our qualified pension plans were underfunded meaning the present value of future obligations exceeded the fair value of plan assets as of december   by approximately million  an improvement of approximately million from our fiscal year end for funding purposes as measured in accordance with the employee retirement income security act erisa  based on preliminary results  as of january   the underfunded status of our qualified pension plans was approximately million  an improvement of approximately million from the prior year 
in  the funded status of these pension plans benefited from the contributions made and favorable performance in pension assets  offset in part by lower interest rates 
we made contributions totaling approximately million in to certain qualified pension plans 
the majority of these contributions were discretionary 
we made a million contribution to one of our qualified pension plans in january we may make discretionary contributions in to our company sponsored qualified pension plans based on cash flows  pension asset performance  interest rates and other factors  but we will not be required to make mandatory contributions in  except for contractual contributions of approximately million in connection with the new york times newspaper guild pension plan 
we have taken a number of other steps to manage our pension related obligations 
at the end of  we froze our non union pension plan 
in addition  in connection with amending certain collective bargaining agreements in  we froze a qualified pension plan and withdrew or partially withdrew from various multiemployer pension plans

table of contents in addition  we have focused on managing our multiemployer pension plans 
while certain of our cost management efforts have created pension withdrawal liabilities  principally in connection with certain union agreements at the globe and the closure of our wholesale distribution business  we believe these measures were an important step to address pension obligations that we projected would otherwise have continued to grow over time 
improving our liquidity we have continued to manage our liquidity position by improving our financial flexibility and we remain focused on reducing our total debt 
we have improved our financial flexibility through the cash we generate from our businesses  and the decisive steps we have taken to reduce costs  manage capital spending  suspend our dividend and rebalance our portfolio of assets 
in addition  in november  we completed a million private debt offering of senior unsecured notes due  and we intend to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes including  among other things  to pay down debt and other financial obligations as part of our refinancing strategy 
with our strong cash flows from operations in  along with proceeds from the private debt offering  we ended with cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million  even after making pension contributions totaling approximately million during the year 
as of december   our total debt and capital lease obligations was approximately million and our total debt and capital lease obligations  net of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  was approximately million  which we believe provides a useful measure of our liquidity and overall debt position 
the majority of our debt matures in or later 
our million revolving credit facility expires in june as of december   other than letters of credit of approximately million  we had no borrowings under the facility 
we believe our cash balance and cash provided by operations  in combination with other financing sources  will be sufficient to meet our immediate financing needs 
we expect that the renewal or replacement of the revolving credit facility  if any  would be at a reduced level and would require additional restrictions and or be on a secured basis 
our decisive steps to manage capital spending further contributed to our improved liquidity in in  our capital expenditures totaled approximately million 
we project capital expenditures will be approximately to million in  as we invest in  among other things  digital initiatives across our company 
outlook we remain in a challenging business environment  resulting in lingering uncertainty about the economic outlook and an increasingly competitive landscape 
advertising revenue continues to be highly volatile and visibility remains limited 
in january  print advertising revenues decreased at approximately the same level we experienced in the fourth quarter of and digital advertising revenues increased in the mid single digits  as we experienced continued strength at the news media group  partially offset by softness at the about group 
we expect circulation revenues in the first quarter of to decrease in line with the declines we experienced in the second half of given current industry forecasts  we expect newsprint prices to increase and negatively impact operating expense  particularly in the first half of for  we project capital expenditures to be between and million 
we expect depreciation and amortization to be to million and interest expense  net to be to million

other items impairment of assets we consolidated the globe s printing facility in billerica  mass  into the boston  mass  printing facility in the second quarter of after exploring different opportunities for the assets at billerica  we entered into an agreement in the third quarter of to sell the majority of these assets to a third party 
therefore  assets with a carrying value of approximately million were written down to their fair value  resulting in a million impairment charge in there were no impairment charges in connection with our annual impairment test  which was completed in the fourth quarter 
however  the regional media group s estimated fair value continues to approximate its carrying value in the regional media group includes approximately million of goodwill in in determining the fair value of the regional media group  we made significant judgments and estimates regarding the expected severity and duration of the current economic slowdown and the secular changes affecting the newspaper industry 
the effect of these assumptions on projected long term revenues  along with the continued benefits from reductions to the group s cost structure  play a significant role in calculating the fair value of the regional media group 
we estimated a annual growth rate to arrive at a normalized residual year representing the perpetual cash flows of the regional media group 
the residual year cash flow was capitalized to arrive at the terminal value of the regional media group 
utilizing a discount rate of  the present value of the cash flows during the projection period and terminal value were aggregated to estimate the fair value of the regional media group 
we assumed a discount rate of in the discounted cash flow analysis for the annual impairment test compared to a discount rate used in the annual impairment test 
in determining the appropriate discount rate  we considered the weighted average cost of capital for comparable companies 
we believe that if the regional media group s projected cash flows are not met during  a goodwill impairment charge is possible in in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million charge for an impairment of assets due to the reduced scope of a systems project at the news media group

annual report management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
table of contents in the first quarter of  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million for the write down of assets for a systems project at the news media group 
we reduced the scope of a major advertising and circulation project to decrease capital spending  which resulted in the write down of previously capitalized costs 
in the third quarter of  we performed an interim impairment test at the new england media group  which is part of the news media group reportable segment  due to certain impairment indicators  including the continued decline in print advertising revenue affecting the newspaper industry and lower than expected current and projected operating results 
the assets tested included goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets  other long lived assets being amortized and an equity method investment in metro boston 
we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million 
this impairment charge reduced the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets of the new england media group to zero 
the fair value of the new england media group s goodwill was the residual fair value after allocating the total fair value of the new england media group to its other assets  net of liabilities 
the total fair value of the new england media group was estimated using a combination of a discounted cash flow model present value of future cash flows and a market approach model based on comparable businesses 
the goodwill was not tax deductible because the acquisition of the globe was structured as a tax free stock transaction 
the fair value of the mastheads at the new england media group was calculated using a relief from royalty method and the fair value of the customer list was calculated by estimating the present value of associated future cash flows 
the property  plant and equipment of the new england media group was estimated at fair value less cost to sell 
the fair value was determined giving consideration to market and income approaches to value 
the carrying value of our investment in metro boston was written down to fair value because the business had experienced lower than expected growth and we anticipated lower growth compared with previous projections  leading management to conclude that the investment was other than temporarily impaired 
the impairment was recorded within income from joint ventures 
our annual impairment test  which was completed in the fourth quarter  resulted in an additional non cash impairment charge of million relating to the iht masthead 
the impairment charge reduced the carrying value of the iht masthead to zero 
the asset impairment mainly resulted from lower projected operating results and cash flows primarily due to the economic downturn and secular decline of print advertising revenues

other liabilities other in our consolidated balance sheets include liabilities related to i deferred compensation  primarily consisting of our deferred executive compensation plan the dec plan  ii our liability for uncertain tax positions  and iii various other liabilities 
these liabilities are not included in the table above primarily because the future payments are not determinable 
the dec plan enables certain eligible executives to elect to defer a portion of their compensation on a pre tax basis 
while the initial deferral period is for a minimum of two years up to a maximum of years after which time taxable distributions must begin  the executive has the option to extend the deferral period

table of contents critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements for the periods presented 
we continually evaluate the policies and estimates we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
in general  management s estimates are based on historical experience  information from third party professionals and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results may differ from those estimates made by management 
we believe our critical accounting policies include our accounting for long lived assets  retirement benefits  stock based compensation  income taxes  self insurance liabilities and accounts receivable allowances 
additional information about these policies can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
specific risks related to our critical accounting policies are discussed below 
long lived assets we evaluate whether there has been an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets not amortized on an annual basis or in an interim period if certain circumstances indicate that a possible impairment may exist 
all other long lived assets are tested for impairment if certain circumstances indicate that a possible impairment exists 
in thousands december  december  long lived assets total assets percentage of long lived assets to total assets the impairment analysis is considered critical to our segments because of the significance of long lived assets to our consolidated balance sheets 
we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level  which are our operating segments 
separate financial information about these segments is regularly evaluated by our chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
fair value is calculated by a combination of a discounted cash flow model and a market approach model 
in calculating fair value for each reporting unit  we generally weigh the results of the discounted cash flow model more heavily than the market approach because the discounted cash flow model is specific to our business and long term projections 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  the second step must be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill 
the discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgments  estimates and assumptions  many of which are interdependent  about future revenues  operating margins  growth rates  capital expenditures  working capital and discount rates 
the starting point for the assumptions used in our discounted cash flow analysis is the annual long range financial forecast 
the annual planning process that we undertake to prepare the long range financial forecast takes into consideration a multitude of factors  including historical growth rates and operating performance  related industry trends  macroeconomic conditions  and marketplace data  among others 
assumptions are also made for perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long range financial forecast period 
our estimates of fair value are sensitive to changes in all of these variables  certain of which relate to broader macroeconomic conditions outside our control 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the new york times company p 

table of contents the market approach analysis includes applying a multiple  based on comparable market transactions  to certain operating metrics of the reporting unit 
we compare the sum of the fair values of our reporting units to our market capitalization to determine whether our estimates of reporting unit fair value are reasonable 
intangible assets that are not amortized trade names are tested for impairment at the asset level by comparing the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount 
fair value is calculated utilizing the relief from royalty method  which is based on applying a royalty rate  which would be obtained through a lease  to the cash flows derived from the asset being tested 
the royalty rate is derived from market data 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  the asset is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value of the asset 
all other long lived assets intangible assets that are amortized  such as customer lists  as well as property  plant and equipment are tested for impairment at the asset group level associated with the lowest level of cash flows 
an impairment exists if the carrying value of the asset i is not recoverable the carrying value of the asset is greater than the sum of undiscounted cash flows and ii is greater than its fair value 
the significant estimates and assumptions used by management in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  other intangible assets acquired and other long lived assets are estimated future cash flows  discount rates  growth rates  as well as other factors 
any changes in these estimates or assumptions could result in an impairment charge 
the estimates  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s subjective judgment 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated results of the impairment tests can vary within a range of outcomes 
in addition to annual testing  management uses certain indicators to evaluate whether the carrying values of our long lived assets may not be recoverable and an interim impairment test may be required 
these indicators include i current period operating or cash flow declines combined with a history of operating or cash flow declines or a projection forecast that demonstrates continuing declines in cash flow or an inability to improve our operations to forecasted levels  ii a significant adverse change in the business climate  whether structural or technological and iii a decline in our stock price and market capitalization 
management has applied what it believes to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for its impairment testing 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
retirement benefits our pension and other postretirement benefit costs are accounted for using actuarial valuations 
we are required to recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans measured as the difference between plan assets and the benefit obligation on the balance sheet and to changes in the funded status that arise during the period but are not recognized as components of net periodic pension cost  within other comprehensive income  net of income taxes 
as of december   the assets related to our qualified pension plans were measured at fair value 
we consider accounting for retirement plans critical to all of our operating segments because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions  which include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  salary growth  long term return on plan assets and mortality rates 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the impact from our pension and other postretirement benefits could vary within a range of outcomes and could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
see pensions and other postretirement benefits below for more information on our retirement benefits

annual report management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
table of contents stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  and for certain awards at the end of each reporting period based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the appropriate vesting period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  the expected volatility of our stock and expected dividends 
in addition  judgment is required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates or different key assumptions were used  it could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding stock based compensation expense 
income taxes we consider accounting for income taxes critical to our operations because management is required to make significant subjective judgments in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowances that may be required against deferred tax assets 
income taxes are recognized for the following i amount of taxes payable for the current year and ii deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequence of events that have been recognized differently in the financial statements than for tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are established using statutory tax rates and are adjusted for tax rate changes in the period of enactment 
we are also required to assess whether deferred tax assets shall be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our process includes collecting positive eg  sources of taxable income and negative eg  recent historical losses evidence and assessing  based on the evidence  whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position if that tax position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the tax position 
this involves the identification of potential uncertain tax positions  the evaluation of tax law and an assessment of whether a liability for uncertain tax positions is necessary 
different conclusions reached in this assessment can have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which could require an extended period of time to resolve 
until formal resolutions are reached between us and the tax authorities  the timing and amount of a possible audit settlement for uncertain tax benefits is difficult to predict 
self insurance we self insure for workers compensation costs  automobile and general liability claims  up to certain deductible limits  as well as for certain employee medical and disability benefits 
the recorded liabilities for self insured risks are primarily calculated using actuarial methods 
the liabilities include amounts for actual claims  claim growth and claims incurred but not yet reported 
actual experience  including claim frequency and severity as well as health care inflation  could result in different liabilities than the amounts currently recorded

annual report management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
table of contents for funding purposes as measured in accordance with erisa  based on preliminary results  the underfunded status of our qualified pension plans as of january   was approximately million  an improvement of approximately million from the prior year 
in  the funded status of these pension plans benefited from contributions and favorable asset performance  offset in part by lower interest rates 
we made contributions of approximately million to certain qualified pension plans in the majority of these contributions were discretionary 
we made a million contribution to one of our company sponsored qualified pension plans in january we may make discretionary contributions in to our company sponsored qualified pension plans based on cash flows  pension asset performance  interest rates and other factors  but we will not be required to make mandatory contributions  except for contractual contributions of approximately million in connection with the new york times newspaper guild pension plan 
pension expense is calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected long term rate of return on assets for qualified plans and a discount rate 
our methodology in selecting these actuarial assumptions is discussed below 
in determining the expected long term rate of return on assets  we evaluated input from our investment consultants  actuaries and investment management firms  including their review of asset class return expectations  as well as long term historical asset class returns 
projected returns by such consultants and economists are based on broad equity and bond indices 
our objective is to select an average rate of earnings expected on existing plan assets and expected contributions to the plan during the year 
the expected long term rate of return determined on this basis was in our plan assets had a rate of return of approximately in we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to meet our investment strategy 
the value market related value of plan assets is multiplied by the expected long term rate of return on assets to compute the expected return on plan assets  a component of net periodic pension cost 
the market related value of plan assets is defined as either fair value or a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value over not more than five years 
our market related value is a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value over three years 
based on the composition of our assets at the beginning of the year  we estimated our expected long term rate of return to be  a decline of 
from if we had decreased our expected long term rate of return on our plan assets by 
in  pension expense would have increased by million in for our qualified pension plans 
our funding requirements would not have been materially affected 
we determined our discount rate using a ryan alm  inc curve the ryan curve 
the ryan curve provides the bonds included in the curve and allows adjustments for certain outliers eg  bonds on watch 
we believe the ryan curve allows us to calculate an appropriate discount rate 
to determine our discount rate  we project a cash flow based on annual accrued benefits 
for active participants  the benefits under the respective pension plans are projected to the date of termination 
the projected plan cash flow is discounted to the measurement date  which is the last day of our fiscal year  using the annual spot rates provided in the ryan curve 
a single discount rate is then computed so that the present value of the benefit cash flow equals the present value computed using the ryan curve rates 
the discount rate determined on this basis was for our qualified plans and for our non qualified plans as of december  if we had decreased the expected discount rate by 
in  pension expense would have increased by approximately million for our qualified pension plans and million for our non qualified pension plans 
our funding requirements would not have been materially affected 
we will continue to evaluate all of our actuarial assumptions  generally on an annual basis  and will adjust as necessary 
actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates  the level of contributions we make and various other factors

table of contents see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our pension plans 
other postretirement benefits we provide health benefits to retired employees and their eligible dependents who are not covered by any collective bargaining agreements  if the employees meet specified age and service requirements 
we no longer provide post age retiree medical benefits for employees who retire on or after march  we also contribute to a postretirement plan under the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement 
we accrue the costs of postretirement benefits during the employees active years of service and our policy is to pay our portion of insurance premiums and claims from our assets 
the annual postretirement expense was calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions  including a health care cost trend rate and a discount rate 
the health care cost trend rate range decreased to to as of december   from to as of december  a increase decrease in the health care cost trend rates range would result in an increase of million or a decrease of million in our service and interest costs  respectively  two factors included in the calculation of postretirement expense 
a increase decrease in the health care cost trend rates would result in an increase of approximately million or a decrease of approximately million  in our accumulated benefit obligation as of december  our discount rate assumption for postretirement benefits is consistent with that used in the calculation of pension benefits 
see pension benefits above for information on our discount rate assumption 
see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board issued new guidance which amends previous guidance related to the accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the guidance specifically addresses how consideration should be allocated to the separate units of accounting 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   and will apply to our fiscal year 
the guidance can be applied prospectively to new or materially modified arrangements after the effective date or retrospectively for all periods presented  and early application is permitted 
we do not believe the adoption will have a material impact on our financial statements

newsprint is a commodity subject to supply and demand market conditions 
we have equity investments in two paper mills  which provide a partial hedge against price volatility 
the cost of raw materials  of which newsprint expense is a major component  represented of our total operating costs in and in based on the number of newsprint tons consumed in and  a per ton increase in newsprint prices would have resulted in additional newsprint expense of million pre tax in and million pre tax in a significant portion of our employees are unionized and our results could be adversely affected if labor negotiations were to restrict our ability to maximize the efficiency of our operations 
in addition  if we were to experience labor unrest  strikes or other business interruptions in connection with labor negotiations  or if we are unable to negotiate labor contracts on reasonable terms  our ability to produce and deliver our most significant products could be impaired
