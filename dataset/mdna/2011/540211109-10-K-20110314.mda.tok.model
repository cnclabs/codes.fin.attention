item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere herein 
executive overview we are the largest provider of interactive media and connectivity solutions to the hospitality industry in the united states  canada and mexico 
our primary offerings include guest paid entertainment  such as on demand movies  and hotel paid services  including cable television programming and internet access services 
as of december   we provided interactive and media networks and connectivity solutions to approximately million hotel rooms in north america and provide our hospitality solutions in select international markets  primarily through local or regional licensees 
in addition  we also have a growing presence in the healthcare market  where we sell and maintain interactive television systems which provide on demand patient education  information and entertainment to healthcare facilities throughout the united states 
as of december   our systems were installed in healthcare facilities  representing approximately  beds  and we had an additional six facilities under contract 
our video on demand served room base consists of million hotel rooms in approximately  of the best hotels throughout the united states  canada and mexico  and our business strategy is focused unlocking the full value those rooms represent 
we believe there is substantial value beyond the returns we are generating from our current analog base  and converting that base to high definition hd represents a significant and proven opportunity 
rooms with our hd system generated approximately more revenue than rooms installed with analog technology 
the higher revenue performance is driven by a lift in guest entertainment revenue within our hd rooms  a higher penetration of lodgenet provided hd cable programming within hd rooms and the mix of converted rooms are from generally higher chain scale properties 
another highlight of our hd system is the rapid decline in the amount of capital we invest to equip a room with hd  as we leverage the technology cost curve and benefit from ongoing operating efficiencies 
during the last year  we have seen a decrease in the cost to install a new hd room  from an average of in to for in addition  we believe envision  our next generation  interactive television platform  will create additional revenues from internet sourced and other interactive applications  information and entertainment 
we successfully installed our first envision system in january our total revenue for was million  a decrease of million or  compared to the decrease in revenue came mainly from a decrease in guest entertainment revenue  as well as from system sales and related services  partially offset by increases in revenue from hotel services  advertising services and healthcare 
guest entertainment revenue decreased million or in  resulting from an reduction in revenue on a per installed room basis  in addition to a reduction in the average number of rooms served over the prior year period 
hotel services revenue increased million or for this increase resulted from price changes and higher priced programming packages purchased by hotels as they install high definition television systems 
system sales and related services decreased million or in the decrease was primarily driven by a decline in broadband equipment sales 
the hotel networks thn  our advertising services subsidiary  generated million of advertising services revenue during compared to million in the prior year  an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily the result of an increase in carriage services revenue 
healthcare revenue increased million or  to million during versus million in total direct costs were million in  a decrease of million or  as compared to million in the decrease in total direct costs was primarily due to decreased commissions and content royalties  lower system and equipment costs and a reduction in recurring connectivity and other internet support costs 
advertising services experienced lower fixed costs in as well  due to lower satellite distribution costs 
partially offsetting these reductions was an increase in television programming costs  which vary with the increased revenue and the services provided 
these changes improved gross margins to in compared to for the prior year 

table of contents system operations expenses and selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in compared to million in the increase was driven by debt issuance costs of million related to financing options  higher legal fees  service and maintenance costs  travel  higher fuel costs and business development costs 
we generated million of cash from operating activities during  as compared to million in the increase was primarily from the increase of our accounts payable balance 
a portion of this working capital increase is expected to reverse in cash used for property and equipment additions  including growth related capital  was million in during the year  we also used the cash generated from operations to pay the required term loan principal repayments of million and made million of additional payments 
we achieved our final covenant step down during the third quarter of  and ended the year with a leverage ratio as defined on page  calculated on a consolidated debt basis  of times compared to the covenant of times 
hospitality and advertising services business guest entertainment includes purchases for on demand movies  network based video games  music and music videos and television on demand programming 
one of our main sources of revenue  generating of total revenue  is providing in room  interactive guest entertainment  for which the hotel guest pays on a per view  hourly or daily basis 
our total guest generated revenue depends on a number of factors  including the number of rooms on our network 
we can increase revenue over time by increasing the number of rooms served by our interactive television systems 
our ability to expand our room base is dependent on a number of factors  including newly constructed hotel properties and the attractiveness of our technology  service and support to hotels currently operating without an interactive television system 
the occupancy rate at the property 
our revenue also varies depending on hotel occupancy rates  which are subject to a number of factors  including seasonality  general economic conditions and world events  such as terrorist threats or public health issues 
occupancy rates for the properties we serve are typically higher during the second and third quarters due to seasonal travel patterns 
we target higher occupancy properties in diverse demographic and geographic locations in an effort to mitigate occupancy related risks 
the buy rate of hotel guests 
this is impacted by a number of issues  some of which are not under our control 
specific issues impacting buy rate include the number of rooms equipped with our high definition hd systems 
we can increase revenue by increasing the number of hd rooms served 
our ability to expand our hd room base is dependent on a number of factors  including availability of capital resources from the hotels and us to invest in hd televisions and equipment 
we are focused on accelerating the installation of our hd systems as hotels increase their purchase of hd televisions  since the revenue generated from the digital quality experience within our installed hd rooms is approximately higher than our analog rooms 
the popularity  timeliness and amount of content offered at the hotel 
our revenues vary  to a certain degree  with the number  timeliness and popularity of movie content available for viewing  and whether the content is presented in digital or analog format 
historically  a decrease in the availability of popular movie content has adversely impacted revenue  and the availability of high definition content has increased revenue 
although not completely within our control  we seek to program and promote the most popular available movie content and other content to maximize revenue and profitability 
the price of the service purchased by the hotel guest 
generally  we control the prices charged for our products and services and manage pricing in an effort to maximize revenue and overall profitability 
we establish pricing based on such things as the demographics of the property served  the popularity of the content and overall general economic conditions 
our technology enables us to measure the popularity of our content and make decisions to best position such content and optimize revenue from such content 

table of contents the availability of alternative programming 
we compete directly for customers with a variety of other interactive service providers  including other interactive television service providers  cable television companies  direct broadcast satellite companies  television networks and programmers  internet service providers and portals  technology consulting and service firms  companies offering web sites which provide on demand movies  movie downloads  rental companies providing dvds which can be viewed in properly equipped hotel rooms or on other portable viewing devices and hotels which offer in room laptops with internet access or other types of internet access systems 
we also compete  in varying degrees  with other leisure time activities such as movie theaters  the internet  radio  print media  personal computers and other alternative sources of entertainment and information 
consumer sentiment 
the willingness of guests to purchase our entertainment services is also impacted by the general economic environment and its impact on consumer sentiment 
historically  such impacts were not generally material to our revenue results  however  since the last half of  economic conditions have had a significant  negative impact on our revenue levels 
as economic conditions improve in the future  guest purchase activity may or may not increase to the same levels previously experienced by the company 
the primary direct costs of providing guest entertainment are license fees paid to major motion picture studios  which are variable and based on a percent of guest generated revenue  for non exclusive distribution rights of recently released major motion pictures  commissions paid to our hotel customers  which are also variable and based on a percent of guest generated revenue  license fees  which are based on a percent of guest generated revenue  for television on demand  music  music videos  video games and sports programming  and one time license fees paid for independent films  most of which are non rated and intended for mature audiences 
hotel services includes revenue from hotels for services such as television channels and recurring broadband internet service and support to the hotels 
another major source of our revenue is providing cable television programming and internet services to the lodging industry  for which the hotel pays a fixed monthly fee 
cable television programming 
we offer a wide variety of satellite delivered cable television programming paid for by the hotel and provided to guests at no charge 
the cable television programming is delivered via satellite  pursuant to an agreement with directv  and is distributed over the internal hotel network  and typically includes premium channels such as hbo and showtime  which broadcast major motion pictures and specialty programming  as well as non premium channels  such as cnn and espn 
with the launch of the high definition configuration of our interactive television system  we also began offering high definition cable television programming to the extent available from broadcast sources and directv 
broadband internet service and support 
we also design  install and operate wired and wireless broadband internet systems at hotel properties 
these systems control access to the internet  provide bandwidth management tools and allow hotels to charge guests or provide the access as a guest amenity 
post installation  we generate recurring revenue through the ongoing maintenance  service and call center support services to hotel properties installed by us and also to hotel properties installed by other providers or through a revenue share model in which hotel guests pay for broadband internet and we pay a commission to our hotel customers 
while this is a highly competitive area  we believe we have important advantages as a result of our proactive monitoring interface with hotel systems to improve up time  existing hotel customer relationships and our nationwide field service network 
system sales and related services 
we also generate revenue from other products and services within the hotel and lodging industry  including sales of broadband internet and other interactive television systems and equipment  cable television programming reception equipment  internet conference services and professional services  such as design  project management and installation services 

table of contents advertising services 
we deliver advertising supported media into select hotel segments  from which we earn revenue from the sale of television commercials  channel access or other marketing based programs 
the demographic and professional profile of the traveler within our room base tends to have characteristics we believe may be attractive to consumer marketing organizations 
by approaching guests with relevant messaging when they are in the comfort of a hotel room  free of distractions  advertisers have a prime opportunity to capture the attention of and connect with these desired consumers 
in addition to market demands  our revenue is also dependent on rooms available to promote customer products and services 
as of december  and december   we provided advertising media services to approximately million hotel rooms 
we also deliver targeted advertising and services to approximately  hotel rooms on popular satellite delivered channels 
key metrics rooms served one of the metrics we monitor within our hospitality and advertising services business is the number of rooms we serve with our various services 
as of december  we had the following number of rooms installed with the designated service total rooms served total guest entertainment rooms total hd rooms percent of total guest entertainment rooms total cable television programming ftg rooms percent of total guest entertainment rooms total broadband internet rooms percent of total rooms served total rooms served include rooms receiving one or more of our services  including rooms served by international licensees 
guest entertainment rooms  of which are digital  receive one or more guest entertainment services  such as movies  video games  music or other interactive and advertising services 
hd rooms are equipped with high definition capabilities 
cable television programming ftg rooms receive basic or premium cable television programming 
represents rooms receiving high speed internet service 
high definition room growth we also track the penetration of our high definition television hdtv system  since rooms equipped with hdtv services typically generate higher revenue from guest entertainment and hotel services than rooms equipped with our standard definition vod systems 
hdtv room growth occurs as we install our hdtv system in newly contracted rooms or convert certain existing rooms to the hdtv system in exchange for contract extensions 
the installation of an hdtv system typically requires a capital investment by both the company and the hotel operator 
hdtv growth has been constrained by reduced hotel capital spending budgets  given the negative impact of the economy on the hospitality industry 
we are prepared to increase capital investment levels and work jointly with our best hotel customers to continue the rollout of high definition systems within the operating and capital plans of the hotels and the company 
we installed our hdtv systems in the following number of net new rooms as of december net new hdtv rooms hdtv rooms  including new installations and major upgrades  are equipped with high definition capabilities 

table of contents capital investment per installed room the average investment per room associated with an installation can fluctuate due to engineering efforts  component costs  product segmentation  cost of assembly and installation  average number of rooms for properties installed  certain fixed costs and hotel capital contributions 
the following table sets forth our average installation and conversion investment cost per room during the years ended december average cost per hd room new installation average cost per hd room conversion the decrease in the average cost per new and converted hd rooms from to was primarily driven by lower component and overhead costs  larger average number of rooms for properties installed  hotels contributing a greater share of total installation costs through purchases of systems and equipment and engineering efforts 
average revenue per room we monitor the average revenue we generate per hospitality and advertising services room 
guest entertainment revenue can fluctuate based on several factors  including occupancy  consumer sentiment  mix of travelers  the availability of high definition and alternative programming  the popularity of movie content  the mix of services purchased and the overall economic environment 
hotel services revenue can fluctuate based on the percentage of our hotels purchasing cable television programming services from us  the type of services provided at each site  as well as the number of hotels purchasing broadband service and support from us 
system sales and related services revenue can fluctuate based on the number of system and equipment sales  including broadband systems sales 
advertising services revenue can fluctuate based on the demand for advertising and the performance of products and services sold to business and leisure travelers  as well as the number of rooms available to promote within 
the following table sets forth the components of our hospitality and advertising services revenue per room for the years ended december average monthly revenue per room hospitality and advertising services guest entertainment hotel services system sales and related services advertising services total hospitality and advertising services revenue per room 
table of contents direct costs guest entertainment direct costs vary based on content license fees  the mix of guest entertainment products purchased and the commission earned by the hotel 
hotel services direct costs include the cost of cable television programming and the cost of broadband internet support services 
the direct costs of system sales and related services primarily include the cost of the systems and equipment sold to hotels 
advertising services direct costs include the cost of developing and distributing programming 
the overall direct cost margin primarily varies based on the composition of revenue 
the following table sets forth our hospitality and advertising services direct expenses per room for the years ended december direct costs per room hospitality and advertising services guest entertainment hotel services system sales and related services advertising services total hospitality and advertising services direct costs per room the average direct cost per guest entertainment room varies with revenue and  from to  was driven by lower commissions earned by the hotels and offset by a change in the mix of movie products purchased 
healthcare business the healthcare market in the united states consists of over  hospital beds across  facilities 
we believe most hospitals currently do not have any form of interactive television services 
the primary reasons hospitals purchase interactive television systems are to increase patient satisfaction  to improve clinical outcomes and to increase operational efficiencies 
our healthcare revenue is generated through a variety of services and solutions provided to care facilities  including revenue generated from the sale of the interactive system hardware  software license and installation services  revenue from the sale and installation of directv satellite equipment and related programming  revenue from recurring support agreements for interactive content  software maintenance and technical field service support  including service agreements covering cable plant  directv satellite equipment and interactive systems  and revenue generated from cable plant design  modification and installation  as well as television installation services 
as of december   we equipped healthcare facilities  or approximately  beds  with these services and solutions to improve the overall patient experience  as compared to properties or approximately  beds as of december  
table of contents general operations total operating expenses we also monitor and manage the operating expenses per room 
system operations expenses consist of costs directly related to the operation and maintenance of systems at hotel sites

special note regarding the use of non gaap financial information to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  we use free cash flow  a non gaap measure derived from results based on gaap 
the presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered superior to  in isolation of  or as a substitute for  results prepared in accordance with gaap 
we define free cash flow  a non gaap measure  as cash provided by operating activities less cash used for certain investing activities 
free cash flow is a key liquidity measure  but should not be construed as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities or as a measure of our profitability or performance 
we provide information about free cash flow because we believe it is a useful way for us  and our investors  to measure our ability to satisfy cash needs  including interest payments on our debt  taxes and capital expenditures 
gaap requires us to provide information about cash flow generated from operations 
our definition of free cash flow does not take into account our debt service requirements or other commitments 
accordingly  free cash flow is not necessarily indicative of amounts of cash which may be available to us for discretionary purposes 
our method of computing free cash flow may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
free cash flow we manage our free cash flow by seeking to maximize the amount of cash we generate from our operations and managing the level of our investment activity 
during  we allocated a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the repayment of debt and used the balance of the cash flow for capital expenditures 
we can manage capital expenditures by reducing the per room installation cost of a room and by varying the number of rooms we install in any given period 

table of contents levels of free cash flow are set forth in the following table dollar amounts in thousands cash provided by operating activities property and equipment additions liquidity and capital resources we ended the year with cash of million and were in compliance with all of the credit facility covenants 
for the year  cash provided by operating activities was million

we used million for preferred stock dividends in in march  we entered into an agreement to sell  shares of our common stock to the underwriter  for resale to the public 
the underwriter had an option to purchase up to  additional shares of common stock to cover overallotments 
we completed our offering of  shares inclusive of the underwriter s option to purchase the additional  shares  bringing the total aggregate common stock sold to million 
net proceeds from the issuance of common stock were million  with offering and related costs totaling million 
the net proceeds of million were used to reduce our debt 
in june  we entered into a purchase agreement to sell  shares of our series b cumulative perpetual convertible preferred stock  par value per share  with a liquidation preference of  per share 
the initial purchaser was also granted a day option to purchase up to an additional  shares of the preferred stock to cover overallotments 
we completed our offering of  shares inclusive of the initial purchaser s option to purchase the additional  shares  bringing the total aggregate liquidation preference of the preferred stock sold to million 
net proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock were million  with offering and related costs totaling million 
our principal sources of liquidity are our cash from operations  our cash on hand and the million revolver portion of our credit facility  which matures in we believe our cash on hand  operating cash flow  borrowing available under the credit facility and potential availability under the shelf registration will be sufficient to fund our business and comply with our financing obligations 
we plan to allocate a portion of our future cash flow from operations to the repayment of debt  as necessary  and to the expansion of our high definition room base 
as of december   working capital was negative million  compared to negative million at december  the change was primarily from the increase of our accounts payable balance 
a portion of this working capital increase is expected to reverse in the change was also driven by the fair value of derivative instruments liability becoming short term as our interest rate swaps expire in june the collectability of our receivables is reasonably assured  as supported by our broad customer base 
our interactive hotel base is well diversified in terms of location  demographics and customer contracts 
we provide our services to various hotel chains  ownership groups and management companies 
in accordance with our hotel contracts  monies collected by the hotel for interactive television services are held in trust on our behalf  thereby limiting our risk from hotel bankruptcies 

table of contents in order to fund our acquisitions of on command and stayonline  in april we entered into a million bank credit facility  comprised of a million term loan  which matures in april  and a million revolving credit facility  which matures in april the required quarterly payments are approximately million  and will be adjusted for any reduction in principal as a result of our early repayments against the loan 
for the fourth quarter of  the adjusted quarterly payment requirement was million 
the term loan bears interest at our option of the bank s base rate plus a margin of or libor plus a margin of 
the agreement provides that when our consolidated leverage ratio is below times  the term loan bears interest at our option of the bank s base rate plus a margin of or libor plus a margin of 
the term loan is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the company 
the credit facility includes terms and conditions which require compliance with leverage and interest coverage covenants 
the credit facility also stipulated we enter into hedge agreements to provide at least of the outstanding term loan into a fixed interest rate for a period not less than two years 
we currently have two outstanding fixed rate swap agreements for million  with fixed interest rates ranging from to see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the term loan interest rate as of december  was 
the all in weighted average interest rate as of december  was  which includes both the term loan interest rate and the difference in the swaps fixed interest rate versus libor  including any ineffective portion of the hedge 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants required of our bank credit facility 
our leverage and interest coverage ratios were as follows for the years ended december actual consolidated leverage ratio maximum per covenant actual consolidated interest coverage ratio minimum per covenant our maximum consolidated leverage ratio is the total amount of all indebtedness of the company  determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with gaap  divided by operating income exclusive of depreciation and amortization and adjusted plus or minus for certain other miscellaneous cash items  non cash items and non recurring items  as defined by the terms of the bank credit facility 
our minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio is a function of operating income exclusive of depreciation and amortization and adjusted plus or minus for certain other miscellaneous cash items  non cash items and non recurring items divided by interest expense  as defined by the terms of the bank credit facility 
maximum consolidated leverage ratio and minimum consolidated interest coverage ratios are defined terms of the bank credit facility and are presented here to demonstrate compliance with the covenants in our credit facility  as noncompliance with such covenants could have a material adverse effect on us 
per the bank credit facility  our maximum consolidated leverage ratio of and minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of continue to maturity in we do not utilize special purpose entities or off balance sheet financial arrangements 

table of contents in order to continue operating efficiently and expand our business  we must remain in compliance with covenants outlined in our credit facility 
our ability to remain in compliance with those covenants will depend on our ability to generate sufficient consolidated ebitda a term defined in our credit facility and to manage our capital investment and debt levels 
we continue taking actions within our control to manage our debt level and remain in compliance with our debt covenants 
the actions within our control include our prudent management of capital investment  working capital and operating costs and exploring other alternatives  which include seeking an amendment to our credit facility 
we are currently pursuing an amendment of our credit facility  which may increase our interest costs  require upfront fees and modify certain other terms which will be less favorable than we currently have 
if we are not able to remain in compliance with our current debt covenants and our lenders will not amend or waive covenants with which we are not in compliance  the debt would be due  we would not be able to satisfy our financial obligations and we would need to seek alternative financing 
if we were not able to secure alternative financing  this would have a substantial adverse impact on the company and our ability to continue our operations 
we achieved a consolidated leverage ratio of compared to the maximum allowable of for the fourth quarter of our ability to continue to comply with our current covenants  as well as any revised covenants resulting from an amendment to our credit facility  is subject to the general economic climate and business conditions beyond our control 
additionally  our ability to comply with these covenants depends on achieving our planned operating results and making further debt reductions  as necessary 
although there are signs of stabilization in certain sectors of the economy  the uncertainties impacting travel and lodging  in addition to the constraints in the credit markets  consumer conservatism and other market dynamics  may continue to negatively impact our planned results and required covenants 
if we are not able to remain in compliance with our current debt covenants  or the revised covenants in the event we are successful in amending our credit facility  it will likely have a significant  unfavorable impact on our business and financial condition 
the credit facility also requires we notify the agent upon the occurrence of a material adverse effect prior to any draw on the company s revolving credit facility  as such terms are defined and used within our bank credit facility 
however  under the credit facility  the provision of such a notice is not an event of default  but if such an event occurred  it could restrict the company s ability to obtain additional financing under the revolving credit facility 
as of december   we are not aware of any events which would qualify as a material adverse effect under the credit facility 
the total amount of long term debt outstanding  including the current portion  as of december  was million versus million as of december  in april  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with notional values of million  at a fixed rate of  and million  at a fixed rate of  both of which expire in june these swap arrangements effectively change the underlying debt from a variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate for the term of the swap agreements 
the swap agreements were designated as  and met the criteria for  cash flow hedges and are not considered speculative in nature 
a portion of the million notional amount swap  entered into in april and expiring in june  was rendered ineffective due to the additional payments on our term loan 
the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of this cash flow hedge was a loss of million for the year ended december   and was recognized in interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations

in connection with our programming related agreements  we may guarantee minimum royalties for specific periods or by individual programming content 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
seasonality our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation  depending upon hotel occupancy rates and other factors  including travel patterns and the economy 
our hotel customers typically experience higher occupancy rates during the second and third quarters  due to seasonal travel patterns and  accordingly  we historically have higher revenue and cash flow in those quarters 
however  quarterly revenue can be affected by the availability of popular content during those quarters and by consumer purchasing behavior 
we have no control over when new content is released or how popular it will be  or the effect of economic conditions on consumer behavior

table of contents critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our primary cost drivers are predetermined rates  such as hotel commissions  license fees paid for major motion pictures and other content or one time fixed fees for independent films  and cable television programming costs 
however  the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable based upon the available information 
the critical policies related to the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements are further discussed within the notes of the financial statements as follows revenue recognition footnote goodwill and other intangible assets footnote restructuring footnote recent accounting developments in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb accounting standards update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  which is now codified under fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  revenue recognition 
this asu establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method  and requires a vendor determine its best estimate of selling price in a manner consistent with that used to determine the selling price of the deliverable on a standalone basis 
the asu also significantly expands the required disclosures related to a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
fasb asu no 
was effective on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
depending on how we sell and deliver future systems and services  this asu could have an effect on the timing of revenue recognition and our consolidated results of operations or cash flows

 milestone method of revenue recognition  which is now codified under fasb asc topic  revenue recognition 
this asu provides guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research and development transactions 
consideration which is contingent upon achievement of a milestone in its entirety can be recognized as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone meets all criteria to be considered substantive 
a milestone should be considered substantive in its entirety  and an individual milestone may not be bifurcated 
an arrangement may include more than one milestone  and each milestone should be evaluated individually to determine if it is substantive 
fasb asu no

table of contents in december  the fasb issued fasb asu no 
 when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts  which is now codified under fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
this asu provides amendments to step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not a goodwill impairment exists 
when determining whether it is more likely than not an impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors  such as a significant deterioration in market conditions  indicating an impairment may exist 
fasb asu no 
is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december  early adoption is not permitted 
upon adoption of the amendments  an entity with reporting units having carrying amounts which are zero or negative is required to assess whether is it more likely than not the reporting units goodwill is impaired 
if the entity determines impairment exists  the entity must perform step of the goodwill impairment test for that reporting unit or units 
step involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability  with the excess being implied goodwill 
an impairment loss results if the amount of recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill 
any resulting goodwill impairment should be recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the period of adoption 
we have reporting units with negative carrying value and are evaluating the effect from the adoption of this asu 
depending on market conditions or other qualitative factors  this asu could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including potential losses resulting from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest 
at december   we had debt totaling million  as follows dollar amounts in thousands carrying fair amount value bank credit facility bank term loan capital leases the fair value of our long term debt is estimated based on current interest rates for similar debt of the same remaining maturities and quoted market prices  except for capital leases  which are reported at carrying value 
for our capital leases  the carrying value approximates the fair value 
in addition  the fair value of our long term debt is strictly hypothetical and not indicative of what we are required to pay under the terms of our debt instruments 
we have two interest rate swap agreements  with notional values of million  at a fixed rate of  and million  at a fixed rate of  both of which expire in june the term loan interest rate as of december  was and the capital lease interest rate was 
our all in weighted average interest rate  which includes both the term loan interest rate and the difference in the swaps fixed interest rate versus libor  for the year ended december   was  compared to for the year ended december  after giving effect to the interest rate swap arrangements  we had fixed rate debt of million and no variable rate debt  as the total swap amount was greater than our term loan amount at december  for fixed rate debt  interest rate fluctuations affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows  if effective 
conversely  for variable rate debt  interest rate fluctuations generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
there would be no impact on earnings and cash flow for the next year resulting from a one percentage point increase to interest rates  assuming other variables remain constant 
upon expiration of the interest rate swaps in june  a one percentage point increase to interest rates  assuming other variables remain constant  would impact second half earnings and cash flow by approximately million 

table of contents economic condition and consumer confidence 
our results are generally connected to the performance of the lodging industry  where occupancy rates may fluctuate resulting from various factors 
reduction in hotel occupancy and consumer buy rates  resulting from business  general economic or other events  such as a recession in the united states  significant international crises  acts of terrorism  war or public health issues  could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the overall travel industry and consumer buying pattern can be  and has been in the past  adversely affected by weaker general economic climates  geopolitical instability and concerns about public health 
foreign currency transactions 
a portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of guest entertainment services in canada and mexico 
the results of operations and financial position of our operations in canada and mexico are measured in their local currencies and translated into us dollars 
the effects of foreign currency fluctuations in canada and mexico are somewhat mitigated by the fact expenses and liabilities are generally incurred in the local currency 
the reported income of our canadian and mexican subsidiaries will be higher or lower depending on a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the local currency 
additionally  a portion of our assets are based in canada and mexico and are translated into us dollars at foreign currency exchange rates in effect as of the end of each period 
accordingly  our consolidated assets will fluctuate depending on the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the local currency
