gross margins gross margins were for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  we retained the similar level of gross margins in as a result of our effort to continue outsourcing our production to contract manufacturers in asia  cost reductions and variations in our product mix 
engineering and product development engineering and product development expenses were  or of revenues  for the year ended december   compared to  or of revenues  for the year ended december  the increase is attributable to salary related expenses due to the fact that during the year ended december   we had a temporary decrease in salary related expenses

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported assets  liabilities  sales  and expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that require the most subjective and complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following are considered our most critical accounting policies that  under different conditions or using different assumption or estimates  could show materially different results on our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred when risk of loss and title have transferred to the customer  the sale price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
we generally use customer purchase orders and contracts to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectability based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
revenue on shipments to distributors and resellers is recognized on delivery 
generally  we do not grant a right of return 
however  allowances are provided for stock rotation rights that are granted to distributors in accordance with their respective arrangements 
inventory obsolescence accruals we periodically assess our inventory valuation by reviewing revenue forecasts and technological obsolescence 
we write down the value of obsolete or unmarketable inventory to the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
during and  we recorded inventory write offs of  and  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable are derived from sales to customers located primarily in the us and europe 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and currently require no collateral from our customers 
an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses is maintained in anticipation of the inability of customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  and was  and  respectively 
when we become aware that a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations as a result of bankruptcy or the deterioration of the customer s operating results or financial position  for example  we record a specific allowance to reflect the level of credit risk in the customer s outstanding receivable balance 
we are not able to predict changes in the financial condition of customers  and if the condition or circumstances of our customers deteriorates  estimates of the recoverability of trade receivables could be materially affected and we may be required to record additional allowances 
alternatively  if our estimates are determined to be greater than the actual amounts necessary  we may decrease a portion of such allowance in future periods based on actual collection experience 
other accrued liabilities our accrued liabilities are based on a variety of factors including past experience and  in many cases  require estimates 
if future experience differs from these estimates  operating results in future periods would be impacted 
equity based compensation expense we account for equity based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires the exercise of judgment  including the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
estimated forfeitures are based on historical pre vesting forfeitures 
if actual results differ from these estimates  equity based compensation expense  and therefore our results of operations  could be impacted 
the company estimates the fair value of stock options granted under asc formerly sfas no 
revised  share based payment asc  using the black scholes option pricing model  which uses the following assumption expected volatility is based on historical volatility  which is representative of future volatility over the expected term of the options 
the expected term of options granted was determined based on the simplified method  which is calculated as the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term of the option 
the risk free interest rate is based on the yield of u 
s treasury bonds with equivalent terms 
the dividend yield is based on the company historical and future expectation of dividends payouts 
the company has not paid cash dividends historically and has no plans to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
liquidity and capital resources on december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of  this compares with cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of  at december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents is due mainly to the completion of the purchase of technology for a consideration of  and to an increase in trade receivables and in inventories  offset by increases in accounts payable  related parties trade payables  deferred revenues and other current liabilities 
the increase in working capital is mainly due to an increase in inventories and trade receivables  offset partially by an increase in trade payable related parties 
net cash used in operating activities totaled  for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by operating activities of  for the year ended december  the net usage of cash from operating activities was mainly due to an increase in trade receivable and an increase in inventories  offset by the net income for the year ended december   an increase in accounts payable  related parties trade payables  deferred revenues and other current liabilities 
net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december   compared to net cash used in investing activities of  for the year ended december  the net usage of cash from investing activities is due to the purchase of technology for a consideration of  in particular  on august   the company and its wholly owned subsidiary  dpl  entered into an agreement with tps  a subsidiary of telkoor  pursuant to which  tps sold  assigned and conveyed to dpl all of its rights  title and interest in and to the intellectual property associated with the compact peripheral component interface w ac dc power supply series the assets or ip and dpl granted to tps an irrevocable license to sell the assets in israel on an exclusive basis 
the ip was purchased in order to decrease lead time and the costs associated with the production process 
in consideration for the purchase of the ip  dpl has paid tps  the consideration for the license provided to tps to sell the assets in israel is a royalty fee of of tps direct production costs of sales  due on a quarterly basis 
tps will provide the company reasonable training and technical support  if necessary  for a period of months in order to enable the company to properly and effectively use the ip to manufacture the assets 
in accordance with the agreement  the consideration for the ip may be reduced over a four year period in the event that annual sales for each fiscal year between and are less than a fixed threshold of units on an annual basis based on an offset value per unit as described in the agreement 
if there is a shortfall in sale of units in one annual period and  in the subsequent period  the company sells more than the fixed unit threshold  this difference will be offset from any reduced consideration in any annual periods between and since the transaction was made between two related parties  an external independent valuation has been prepared in order to support the fair value of the ip purchased in accordance with asc formerly statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements asc 
the useful life of the ip has been determined to be five years and the amortization method is the straight line method  as management considers this method the most appropriate 
net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december   and was due to the exercise of employee options 
in september   our wholly owned subsidiary  dpl  entered into a new fifteen year lease for its  square foot facility in salisbury  united kingdom  where it designs  develops  manufactures  markets and distributes commercial and military power products for the european market 
sales and service support staff for its european network of distributors are located within the building together with other functions  such as engineering and administration 
dpl s rent expense is approximately  per month  and dpl has the option to cancel the lease after ten years 
we believe we have adequate resources at this time to continue our operational and promotional efforts to increase sales and support our current operation 
however  if we do not increase our sales  we may have to obtain financing through the issuance of debt and or equity  which may dilute shareholders equity
