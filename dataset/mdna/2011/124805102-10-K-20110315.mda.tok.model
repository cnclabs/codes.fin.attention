cbiz delivers its integrated services through the following four practice groups financial services  employee services  mmp  and national practices 
a description of these groups operating results and factors affecting their businesses is provided below 
same unit revenue represents total revenue adjusted to reflect comparable periods of activity for acquisitions and divestitures 
for example  for a business acquired on july   revenue for the period january  through june  would be reported as revenue from acquired businesses  same unit revenue would include revenue for the periods july through december of both years 
divested operations represent operations that did not meet the criteria for treatment as discontinued operations 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue the following table summarizes total revenue for the years ended december  and in thousands  except percentages year ended december  change change same unit revenue financial services employee services mmp national practices total same unit revenue acquired businesses divested operations total revenue a detailed discussion of revenue by practice group is included under operating practice groups 
gross margin and operating expenses the majority of cbiz s operating costs are relatively fixed in the short term  thus gross margin as a percentage of revenue generally improves with revenue growth  but declines as revenue contracts 
the primary components of operating expenses for the years ended december  and are illustrated in the following table of of change in operating of operating of of expense revenue expense revenue revenue personnel costs deferred compensation costs occupancy costs depreciation and amortization travel and related costs other total operating expenses gross margin other operating expenses include office expense  equipment costs  professional fees  restructuring charges  bad debt and other expenses  none of which are individually significant as a percentage of total operating expenses 
personnel costs as a percentage of revenue increased to for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the increase in personnel costs as a percentage of revenue was primarily the result of a increase in incentive compensation costs incurred in and an increase of in employee benefit costs 
the increase or decrease in personnel costs as a percentage of revenue experienced by the individual practice groups is discussed in further detail under operating practice groups 
the decrease in deferred compensation costs of resulted from adjustments to the fair value of investments held in the deferred compensation plan 
the adjustments to the fair value of investments held in relation to the deferred compensation plan totaled gains of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these adjustments are recorded as compensation expense and are offset by the same adjustments to other income 
table of contents expense  net  and thus do not have an impact on net income 
although these adjustments are recorded as operating expenses  they are not allocated to the individual practice groups 
corporate general and administrative expenses corporate general and administrative g a expenses decreased by million to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period of  and decreased as a percent of revenue by to for the year ended december  the primary components of corporate general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and are illustrated in the following table of of change in g a of g a of of expense revenue expense revenue revenue personnel costs professional services computer costs occupancy costs depreciation and amortization other total corporate general and administrative expenses other corporate general and administrative expenses include office expenses  travel and related costs  insurance expense and other expenses  none of which are individually significant as a percentage of total corporate g a expenses 
interest expense interest expense increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the increase in interest expense is a result of three components an increase of million related to the million of convertible senior subordinated notes that were issued in  a decrease of million from the retirement of million of convertible senior subordinated notes that were issued in  and an increase of million related to the credit facility 
for discussion on the convertible senior subordinated notes  see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
regarding the credit facility  during cbiz entered into a new credit facility agreement that increased the borrowing capacity from million to million  among other changes to the credit facility 
the new credit facility resulted in increased amortized deferred debt charges and increased commitment fee charges recognized in interest expense for the year ended december  versus the comparable period in offsetting these deferred debt and commitment fees was a decrease in average debt outstanding and average interest rates in compared to average debt outstanding under the credit facility was million and million and weighted average interest rates were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
debt is further discussed under liquidity and capital resources and in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
other income expense  net other income expense  net is primarily comprised of adjustments to the fair value of investments held in a rabbi trust related to the deferred compensation plan  interest income  gains and losses on sales of assets  and other miscellaneous income and expenses such as contingent royalties from previous divestitures and adjustments to contingencies related to previous acquisitions 
adjustments to the fair value of investments related to the deferred compensation plan do not impact cbiz s net income as they are offset by the same adjustments to compensation expense recorded as operating or corporate general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
other income expense  net for the year ended december  primarily consists of a million gain in the fair value of investments related to the deferred compensation plan  an adjustment to the company s contingent liability related to prior acquisitions which resulted in other income of million  and interest income of million 
the deferred compensation gain  adjustment to the contingent liability  and interest income were partially offset by a million charge on the early retirement of million of cbiz s convertible senior subordinated notes that were issued in and a million impairment charge related to an investment in auction rate securities

cash earnings per share were and per diluted share for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company believes cash earnings and cash earnings per diluted share non gaap measures more clearly illustrate the impact of certain non cash charges to income from continuing operations and are a useful measure for the company and its analysts 
management uses these performance measures to evaluate cbiz s business  including ongoing performance and the allocation of resources 
cash earnings and cash earnings per diluted share are provided in addition to the presentation of gaap measures and should not be regarded as a replacement or alternative of performance under gaap

table of contents operating practice groups financial services year ended december  change change in thousands  except percentages revenue same unit acquired businesses divested operations total revenue operating expenses gross margin gross margin percent the decrease in same unit revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in aggregate hours charged to clients 
same unit aggregate hours charged to clients declined approximately for the year ended december  compared to year ended december   which was partially offset by a increase in effective rates realized for services provided in the year ended december  versus the comparable period in the decline in hours was due to decreased client demand as well as by improved engagement efficiencies 
the improvement in rates realized for services provided was due to a modest increase in rates as well as improved engagement efficiencies 
revenue from acquired businesses was a result of the acquisition of goldstein lewin  which occurred on january  and to a lesser extent the acquisition of krmt  which occurred on november  cbiz provides a range of services to affiliated cpa firms under joint referral and asas 
fees earned by cbiz under the asas are recorded as revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and were approximately million and million for years ended december  and  respectively  a majority of which is related to services rendered to privately held clients 
the increase in asa fees is primarily the result of the acquisitions 
the largest components of operating expenses for the financial services group are personnel costs  occupancy costs  and travel and related costs which represented and of total operating expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
personnel costs increased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  and represented and of total operating expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was attributable to a million increase associated with the acquisitions of goldstein lewin and krmt  offset by a reduction in same unit personnel cost of million 
the million reduction in same unit personnel costs was associated mainly with current year staff reductions at those units that experienced reduced client demand and offset higher overall incentive compensation costs 
personnel costs represented and of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
occupancy costs are relatively fixed in nature and were million for the year ended december  compared to million in the same period in the prior year  these represented and of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
travel and related costs were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and increased slightly to of revenue for the year ended december  from of revenue for the comparable period of gross margin percentage improved to for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in the improvement in gross margin percentage was attributable to a decrease in same unit personnel costs  lower bad debt expense  decreased controllable spending from cost control initiatives and lower depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year 
the decrease in bad debt expense was due to an overall improvement in general economic conditions in compared to which included increased expense associated with specific client receivables 

table of contents employee services year ended december  change change in thousands  except percentages revenue same unit acquired businesses divested operations total revenue operating expenses gross margin gross margin percent the decrease in same unit revenue was primarily attributable to declines in the company s specialty life insurance  employee benefits and property and casualty businesses  offset in part by increases in the retirement plan advisory and individual wealth management and human capital advisory businesses 
the company s specialty life insurance revenues decreased approximately million from prior year levels due to fewer policy placements  the employee benefits decreased approximately million due to client workforce downsizing  and the property and casualty revenues declined million due to soft market conditions in pricing 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase of approximately million in the retirement advisory and individual wealth management business due to higher asset values resulting largely from favorable market performance  as well as an increase in human capital advisory revenues of approximately million due to an increase in demand for recruiting and other outsourced human resource services 
the growth in revenue from acquired businesses was provided by nba  an employee benefits company in utah that was acquired in the first quarter of  and benexx  a retirement plan business in maryland that was acquired in the third quarter of the largest components of operating expenses for the employee services group are personnel costs  including commissions paid to third party brokers  and occupancy costs  representing and of total operating expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
excluding the costs related to the acquired businesses of million  personnel costs decreased approximately million  primarily as a result of less commissions paid to third party brokers related to a decline in specialty life insurance sales  and a decrease in commissions paid to internal brokers due to the decline in same unit employee benefits and property and casualty revenues 
personnel costs represented and of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
occupancy costs are relatively fixed in nature and were million for the years ended december  and  excluding the costs related to the acquired businesses of million 
the slight decrease in gross margin percent was primarily attributable to two offsetting factors 
the shortfall in revenue at the specialty life insurance operation  which typically functions at a high margin  had a negative impact even though corresponding variable external broker commissions were proportionally lower 
this was offset  in large part  by an increase from retirement advisory and individual wealth management revenues  as well as human capital advisory revenues  as mentioned above 
asset based and investment revenues do not have related direct costs  and human capital advisory revenues have a more fixed cost structure  therefore  growth in those revenues has a favorable impact on gross margin

same unit revenue decreased for the year ended december  versus the comparable period in approximately of the decrease is attributable to client terminations  net of new business sold  with the remaining attributable to decreased revenues from existing clients 
the decline in revenue from client terminations was attributable to many reasons including physician groups losing their hospital contracts  changes in group ownership  hospital consolidations and increased competitive pressures 
the decline in revenue from existing clients can be attributed to several factors including decreases in the number of procedures processed  decreases in pricing and reimbursement rates and a change in the mix of procedures resulting in a decrease in the average revenue per procedure 
the largest components of operating expenses for mmp are personnel costs  professional service fees primarily fees related to outside services for off shore and electronic claims processing  occupancy costs and office expenses primarily postage related to the company s statement mailing services  representing and of total operating expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
personnel costs decreased million for the year ended december   and decreased as a percentage of revenue to compared to for the comparable period in the reduction in personnel costs was partially offset by an increase in professional service fees of million 
in response to the decline in revenue  mmp has reduced headcount and related personnel costs in billing operations through process improvements and labor saving technologies 
office expenses decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  but were of revenue for both periods 
facilities costs decreased million for the year ended december   but increased as a percentage of revenue to versus in the comparable period in the decrease in gross margin is the result of continued pricing and reimbursement pressure as discussed previously 
national practices year ended december  change change in thousands  except percentages revenue same unit acquired businesses divested operations total revenue operating expenses gross margin gross margin percent 
table of contents the national practices group is primarily comprised of a cost plus contract with cbiz s largest client edward jones  healthcare consulting  and the company s mergers and acquisition business 
revenues from the edward jones business account for approximately two thirds of the national practice group s revenue  with the healthcare consulting and mergers and acquisitions accounting for the remaining revenue 
the decrease in revenue was attributable to a decrease of approximately million in the healthcare consulting business and approximately million in the mergers and acquisitions business  offset by an increase in revenue of approximately million in services provided to edward jones 
the decrease in healthcare consulting was primarily the result of a decrease in the medical audit services line of business which provides services to healthcare providers to ensure they are correctly applying for and receiving medicare and medicaid reimbursements 
the decrease in revenue related to cbiz s mergers and acquisition business was due to less success fees being earned as a result of fewer transactions being closed 
the increase in the edward jones revenue was primarily a result of additional services provided under the contract 
the largest components of operating expenses for the national practices group are personnel costs  occupancy costs and travel and related costs  representing and of operating expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
personnel expenses increased million and were of revenue for the year ended december  compared to of revenue for the comparable period in approximately million of the increase in personnel cost was necessary to support revenue growth from services provided to edward jones as well as annual merit increases 
this was offset by a million decrease in personnel costs related to the healthcare consulting business as a result of the decline in revenue and demand for services 
travel and related costs were consistent in both periods and were million for the years ended december  and occupancy costs are relatively fixed in nature and were million for the years ended december  and the decrease in gross margin percent was primarily due to less success fees earned by the mergers and acquisitions business as well as the impact of the decline in healthcare consulting revenue during the year ended december  versus transactions completed by the mergers and acquisitions business generally results in a large amount of revenue with modest incremental costs 
fewer success fees have a disproportionate negative impact on gross margin percent 
the decline in healthcare revenue resulted in a decrease in overall healthcare related operating expenses  but not to the extent to preserve gross margin

in september  cbiz issued an additional million face value of convertible notes the notes 
concurrent with the issuance of the notes  million of the notes were repurchased 
the balance of million at december  represents the discounted book value of million of notes and the discounted book value of the remaining million of notes

bank debt for amounts due on cbiz s credit facility increased by million to million at december  from december  this increase is primarily due to expenditures of million to repurchase of million shares of cbiz common stock and buy an option to purchase the remaining shares of common stock from the company s largest shareholder  and million in payments for current year acquisitions and contingent payments on prior acquisitions 
these increases were partially offset by cash from operating activities and approximately million of net proceeds from the issuance of the notes which were used to pay down the credit facility 
stockholders equity decreased by million to million at december  from million at december  the decrease in stockholders equity was primarily attributable to share repurchase activity of approximately million shares at a cost of million  which includes million shares of common stock repurchased pursuant to the westbury agreement and million shares repurchased using proceeds from the issuance of the notes

the notes are further disclosed in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources cbiz s principal source of net operating cash is derived from the collection of fees and commissions for professional services and products rendered to its clients 
cbiz supplements net operating cash with a million unsecured credit facility  million in notes  and million in notes 
cbiz entered into a new credit facility agreement on june   amended september   with bank of america as agent bank for a group of seven participating banks 
under this new agreement  cbiz maintains a million unsecured credit facility  which replaced a million credit facility 
the credit facility has a letter of credit sub facility and matures in june at december   cbiz had million outstanding under its credit facility and had letters of credit and performance guarantees totaling million 
available funds under the credit facility  based on the terms of the commitment  were approximately million at december  management believes that cash generated from operations  combined with the available funds from the credit facility  provides cbiz the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the foreseeable future  including capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
in addition  the credit facility provides cbiz the capacity to repay the remaining million of its notes that are callable and putable in june 
table of contents the credit facility also allows for the allocation of funds for strategic initiatives  including acquisitions and the repurchase of cbiz common stock 
under the credit facility  cbiz is required to meet certain financial covenants with respect to i minimum net worth  ii maximum total and senior leverage ratios  and iii a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
cbiz believes it is in compliance with its covenants as of december  cbiz s ability to service its debt and to fund strategic initiatives will depend upon its ability to generate cash in the future

sources and uses of cash the following table summarizes cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for the years ended december   and in thousands total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities cash flows from operating activities represent net income adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in assets and liabilities 
cbiz typically experiences a net use of cash from operations during the first quarter of its fiscal year  as accounts receivable balances grow in response to the seasonal increase in first quarter revenue generated by the financial services practice group primarily for accounting and tax services 
this net use of cash is followed by strong operating cash flow during the second and third quarters  as a significant amount of revenue generated by the financial services practice group during the first four months of the year are billed and collected in subsequent quarters 
during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was composed of net income of million  non cash adjustments to net income of million  offset by a net loss on the discontinued operations transactions and sale of operations totaling million 
non cash adjustments to net income consist of depreciation of fixed assets  amortization of intangibles assets including client lists  non compete agreements  discount on convertible notes  and related deferred financing costs  loss on redemption of notes  adjustments related to contingent earnouts  and expense related to stock based compensation 
these non cash adjustments to net income were partially offset by negative changes in working capital of million 
working capital resulted in a use of cash primarily from slower collections on accounts receivable as evidenced by the increase in dso to days at december  from days at december  this use of working capital was partially offset by sources of cash due to active vendor management  an increase in compensation incentive accruals  and an increase in restructuring charges related to the florida office consolidation

the above table does not reflect million of unrecognized tax benefits  which the company has accrued for uncertain tax positions as cbiz is unable to determine a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of the future payments 
off balance sheet arrangements cbiz maintains asas with independent cpa firms as described more fully under business financial services and in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which qualify as variable interest 
table of contents entities 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not reflect the operations or accounts of variable interest entities as the impact is not material to the financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows of cbiz 
cbiz provides guarantees of performance obligations for a cpa firm with which cbiz maintains an asa 
potential obligations under the guarantees totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
cbiz has recognized a liability for the fair value of the obligations undertaken in issuing these guarantees 
the liability is recorded as other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
cbiz does not expect it will be required to make payments under these guarantees 
cbiz provides letters of credit to landlords lessors of its leased premises in lieu of cash security deposits 
letters of credit totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
in addition  cbiz provides license bonds to various state agencies to meet certain licensing requirements 
the amount of license bonds outstanding at december  and was million 
cbiz has various agreements under which the company may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters 
generally  these indemnification clauses are included in contracts arising in the normal course of business under which the company customarily agrees to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations  warranties  covenants or agreements  related to matters such as title to assets sold and certain tax matters 
payment by cbiz under such indemnification clauses are generally conditioned upon the other party making a claim 
such claims are typically subject to challenge by cbiz and to dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular contract 
further  cbiz s obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and or amount and  in some instances  cbiz may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by cbiz 
it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements due to the conditional nature of cbiz s obligations and the unique facts of each particular agreement 
historically  cbiz has not made any payments under these agreements that have been material individually or in the aggregate 
as of december   cbiz was not aware of any obligations arising under indemnification agreements that would require material payments 
interest rate risk management cbiz periodically uses interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk exposure 
the interest rate swaps effectively mitigate cbiz s exposure to interest rate risk  primarily through converting portions of the floating rate debt under the credit facility  to a fixed rate basis 
these agreements involve the receipt or payment of floating rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate interest payments over the life of the agreements without an exchange of the underlying principal amounts 
at december   cbiz had a total of million notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding that expired in january management will continue to evaluate the potential use of interest rate swaps as it deems appropriate under certain operating and market conditions 
cbiz does not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
cbiz carries million in notes bearing a fixed interest rate of and million in notes bearing a fixed interest rate of 
the notes mature on october  and may not be converted before july  the notes mature on june  and have call protection such that they may not be redeemed until june  at the company s option 
cbiz believes the fixed nature of these borrowings mitigate its interest rate risk 
in connection with payroll services provided to clients  cbiz collects funds from its clients accounts in advance of paying these client obligations 
these funds held for clients are segregated and invested in accordance with the company s investment policy  which requires all investments carry an investment grade rating at the time of initial investment 
the interest income on these investments mitigates the interest rate risk for the borrowing costs of cbiz s credit facility  as the rates on both the investments and the outstanding borrowings against the credit facility are based on market conditions 
critical accounting policies significant accounting policies are described more fully in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the company to make 
table of contents estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in its financial statements 
cbiz s management bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the related facts and circumstances 
the application of these critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions for future uncertainties 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
the policies discussed below address the most critical accounting policies which are the most important to the portrayal of cbiz s financial statements and require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition and valuation of unbilled revenues revenue is recognized only when all of the following are present persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee to the client is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
contract terms are typically contained in a signed agreement with the client or when applicable  other third parties which generally defines the scope of services to be provided  pricing of services  and payment terms generally ranging from invoice date to days after invoice date 
billing may occur prior to  during  or upon completion of the service 
cbiz typically does not have acceptance provisions or right of refund arrangements included in these agreements 
contract terms vary depending on the scope of service provided  the deliverables  and the complexity of the engagement 
cbiz offers a vast array of products and business services to its clients 
those services are delivered through four practice groups 
a description of revenue recognition  as it relates to those groups  is provided below 
financial services revenue primarily consists of fees for services rendered to clients for accounting services  preparation of tax returns  consulting services  compliance projects  services pursuant to asas described under variable interest entities  and valuation services including fairness opinions  business plans  litigation support  purchase price allocations and derivative valuations 
clients are billed for these services based upon a time and expense model  a predetermined agreed upon fixed fee  or as a percentage of savings 
revenue recognition as it pertains to each of these arrangements is as follows time and expense arrangements revenue is recognized based upon actual hours incurred on client projects at expected net realizable rates per hour  plus agreed upon out of pocket expenses 
the cumulative impact on any subsequent revision in the estimated realizable value of unbilled fees for a particular client project is reflected in the period in which the change becomes known 
fixed fee arrangements revenue for fixed fee arrangements is recognized over the performance period based upon progress towards completion  which is determined based upon actual hours incurred on the client project compared to estimated total hours to complete the client project 
contingent revenue arrangements revenue is recognized when savings to the client is determined and collection is reasonably assured 
administrative service agreement revenue revenue for administrative service fees is recognized as services are provided  based upon actual hours incurred 
employee services revenue consists primarily of brokerage and agency commissions  fee income for administering health and retirement plans and payroll service fees 
revenue also includes investment income related to client payroll funds that are held in cbiz accounts  as is industry practice 
a description of the revenue recognition  based on the service provided  insurance product sold  and billing arrangement  is provided below 
commissions revenue commissions relating to brokerage and agency activities whereby cbiz has primary responsibility for the collection of premiums from insured s agency or indirect billing are recognized as of the latter of the effective date of the insurance policy or the date billed to the customer  commissions to be received directly from insurance companies direct billing are recognized when the data necessary from the carriers to properly record revenue becomes available  and life insurance commissions are recognized when the policy becomes effective 
commission revenue is reported net of sub broker commissions  and reserves for estimated policy cancellations and terminations 
the cancellation and termination reserve is based upon estimates and assumptions using historical cancellation and 
table of contents termination experience and other current factors to project future experience 
cbiz periodically reviews the adequacy of the reserve and makes adjustments as necessary 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different results 
commissions which are based upon certain performance targets are recognized at the earlier of written notification that the target has been achieved  or cash collection 
fee income fee income is recognized in the period in which services are provided  and may be based on predetermined agreed upon fixed fees  actual hours incurred on an hourly fee basis  or asset based fees 
revenue for fixed fee arrangements is recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period  as these services are provided to clients continuously throughout the term of the arrangement 
revenue which is based upon actual hours incurred is recognized as services are performed 
revenue for asset based fees is recognized when the data necessary to compute revenue is determinable  which is typically when either market valuation information is available  the data necessary to compute the company s fees is made available by third party administrators or when cash is received 
cbiz only recognizes revenue when cash is received for those arrangements where the data necessary to compute fees is not available to the company in a timely manner 
payroll revenue related to payroll processing fees is recognized when the actual payroll processing occurs 
revenue related to investment income earned on payroll funds is based upon actual amounts earned on those funds and is recognized in the period that the income is earned 
mmp revenue is primarily related to fees charged to clients for billing  collection and full practice management services  which are typically charged to clients based upon a percentage of net collections on the company s clients patient accounts or as a fee per transaction processed 
revenue also relates to fees charged to clients for statement mailing services 
the revenue recognition as it pertains to each of these arrangements is as follows fee income for those arrangements where fees to clients are determined based upon a percentage of net collections  revenue is determinable  earned and recognized when payments are received by the client on their patient accounts 
for those arrangements where clients are charged a fee for each transaction processed  revenue is typically recognized proportionately over a predetermined service period 
statement mailing services revenues for statement mailing services are recognized when statements are processed and mailed 
national practices the business units that comprise the national practices group offer a variety of services 
a description of revenue recognition associated with the primary services is provided below 
technology consulting revenue consists of services that primarily relate to the installation  maintenance and repair of hardware 
these services are charged to customers based on cost plus an agreed upon contractual markup percentage 
health care consulting clients are billed for health care consulting services based upon a predetermined agreed upon fixed fee  time and expense  or as a percentage of savings 
revenue for fixed fee and time and expense arrangements is recognized over the performance period based upon actual hours incurred  and revenue that is contingent upon savings is recognized after contingencies have been resolved and verified by a third party 
mergers acquisitions clients are billed monthly for non refundable retainer fees  or upon the completion of a transaction success fees 
revenue associated with non refundable retainer fees is recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the engagement as services are performed throughout the term of the contract period of the arrangement 
revenue associated with success fee transactions is recognized when the transaction is completed 
valuation of accounts receivable and notes receivable management determines the valuation of accounts receivable including unbilled accounts receivable and notes receivable  and the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts based on estimates of losses related to the 
table of contents respective receivable balance 
management analyzes historical bad debts  client credit worthiness  the age of accounts receivable and current economic trends and conditions when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts and the collectability of notes receivable 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts for each accounting period 
material differences may result if facts and circumstances change in relation to the original estimation 
valuation of goodwill cbiz utilizes the acquisition method of accounting for all business combinations 
intangible assets  other than goodwill  which include client lists and non compete agreements  are amortized over their expected period of benefit  not to exceed ten years 
in accordance with gaap  goodwill is not amortized  but rather is tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each year 
impairment testing may be performed between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
cbiz estimates the fair value of its reporting units utilizing a combination of the discounted cash flow method income approach and the market comparable method market approach 
under the income approach  fair value is estimated as the present value of estimated future cash flows 
this approach requires the use of significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses  projected capital expenditures  changes in working capital and the appropriate discount rate 
the projection of future revenues and expenses inherently includes significant assumptions related to estimated economic trends  expected client behavior and other factors which are beyond management s control 
under the market approach  fair value is estimated by applying the multiples of comparable companies and sales transactions to cbiz s reporting units 
the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the respective reporting unit s net carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds fair value  a possible impairment of goodwill exists and further evaluation is performed 
the aggregate fair value of the reporting units is compared to cbiz s market capitalization as of the annual testing date 
in situations where cbiz s market capitalization is significantly different than the estimated fair value for the combined reporting units  management considers the impact of its assumptions as well as the implied control premium to ensure that the fair values of the reporting units are appropriate 
during the fourth quarter of  cbiz performed detailed valuations on two of its reporting units based on the current year decline in performance in each of the respective reporting units 
the reporting units tested were mmp and cbiz payroll 
as a result of the testing  the fair value of the mmp and cbiz payroll reporting units each exceeded carrying value by at least 
no further evaluation was deemed necessary for these two reporting units 
however  future declines in service revenues or interest rates  or future governmental regulations in the medical industry could impact the business results of the reporting units and could result in possible impairment of the reporting units goodwill balances  which were million and million for mmp and cbiz payroll  respectively  at december  the fair value of cbiz s other reporting units were carried forward from prior years detailed testing as the fair value of these reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying value of that respective reporting unit  the financial statements of these reporting units did not materially change  and no events occurred that would lead management to believe that the fair value determination would be less than the carrying value of the reporting unit 
future decreases in cbiz s stock price  or changes in comparable transaction multiples or other changes in cbiz s business or the market for its services  could reduce the fair value of these reporting units and could result in impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets 
there was no goodwill impairment during the years ended december   or loss contingencies loss contingencies  including litigation claims  are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods 
estimating probable losses requires analysis that often depends on judgment about potential actions by third parties 

table of contents incentive compensation determining the amount of expense to recognize for incentive compensation at interim and annual reporting dates involves management judgment 
expenses accrued for incentive compensation are based upon expected financial results for the year  and the ultimate determination of incentive compensation is unable to be made until after year end results are finalized 
thus  amounts accrued are subject to change in future interim periods if actual future financial results are higher or lower than expected 
in arriving at the amount of expense to recognize  management believes it makes reasonable judgments using all significant information available 
income taxes determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense  income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves management judgment 
management estimates an annual effective tax rate which takes into consideration expected full year results  which is applied to the company s quarterly operating results to determine the provision for income tax expense 
in the event there is a significant  unusual or infrequent item recognized in the quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs 
in addition  reserves are established for uncertain tax positions and contingencies 
see note and note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 
circumstances that could cause cbiz s estimates of effective income tax rates to change include the impact of information that subsequently becomes available as cbiz prepares its corporate income tax returns  the level of actual pre tax income  revisions to tax positions taken as a result of further analysis and consultation  the receipt and expected utilization of federal and state income tax credits  and changes mandated as a result of audits by taxing authorities 
management believes it makes reasonable judgments using all significant information available when estimating income taxes 
other significant policies other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of management judgment and uncertainty as those discussed above  are also critical in understanding the consolidated financial statements 
those policies are described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
asu business combinations topic disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations  which amends accounting standards codification asc by requiring disclosure of pro forma information for business combinations that occurred in the current reporting period 
the disclosures include pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the acquisition date for all business combinations that occurred during the year had been as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period 
asu also expands supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
asu is effective prospectively for business combinations in which the acquisition date is on or after the first day of the annual period beginning on or after december  the adoption of asu will result in the company providing additional annual pro forma disclosures for business combinations that occur subsequent to december  in january  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu  which adds disclosure requirements about transfers in and out of levels and  for activity relating to level measurements  and clarifies input and valuation techniques 
asu is effective for the first reporting period beginning after december   except as it pertains to the requirement to provide the level activity for purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross basis 
this level requirement will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and is not expected to have a material impact on cbiz s consolidated financial statements 
cbiz adopted the applicable provisions of the accounting guidance for year ended december  the adoption did not have a material impact on cbiz s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued asu  consolidations topic improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities asu

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cbiz s floating rate debt under its credit facility exposes the company to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk results when the maturity or repricing intervals of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are different 
a change in the federal funds rate  or the reference rate set by bank of america  na  would affect the rate at which cbiz could borrow funds under its credit facility 
cbiz s balance outstanding under its credit facility at december  was million 
if market rates were to increase or decrease basis points from the levels at december   interest expense would increase or decrease approximately million annually 
cbiz does not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments 
cbiz periodically uses interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk exposure 
the interest rate swaps effectively modify the company s exposure to interest rate risk  primarily through converting portions of its floating rate debt under the credit facility to a fixed rate basis 
these agreements involve the receipt or payment of floating rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate interest payments over the life of the agreements without an exchange of the underlying principal amounts 
at december   cbiz had a total notional amount of million related to its interest rate swaps outstanding  which expired in january management will continue to evaluate the potential use of interest rate swaps as it deems appropriate under certain operating and market conditions 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding interest rate swaps 
in connection with cbiz s payroll business  funds held for clients are segregated and invested in short term investments  which included ars prior to the dislocation of this market 
ars are variable rate debt instruments with longer stated maturities whose interest rates are reset at pre determined short term intervals through a dutch auction system 
in accordance with the company s investment policy  all investments carry an investment grade rating at the time of the initial investment 
since  conditions in the global credit markets have resulted in the failure of auctions for the ars that cbiz holds because the amount of securities submitted for sale exceed the amount of bids 
a failed auction does not necessarily represent a default by the issuer of the underlying security 
to date  cbiz has collected all interest on all of its auction rate securities when due and expects to continue to do so in the future 
the principal associated with failed auctions will not be accessible until successful auctions resume  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  or issuers use a different form of financing to replace these securities 
cbiz understands that issuers and financial markets are working on alternatives that may improve liquidity  although it is not yet clear when or to what extent such efforts will be successful 
if credit conditions continue to recover  however  the likelihood of alternative financing options becoming available to the issuers of the securities will improve 
while cbiz continues to earn and receive interest on these investments at the contractual rates  the estimated fair value of its investment in ars no longer approximates face value 
see notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding ars 
despite the failed auctions with regards to ars  cbiz believes it has adequate liquidity to operate and settle client obligations as the majority of cbiz s client funds are invested in highly liquid  short term money market funds
