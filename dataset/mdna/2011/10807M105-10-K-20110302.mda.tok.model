item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  which are included elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical information  this discussion includes forward looking information that involves risks and assumptions which could cause actual results to differ materially from management expectations 
see part i  item a  risk factors  and special note regarding forward looking statements at the beginning of this report 
overview we are a provider of postsecondary education services 
our regionally accredited academic institutions offer associate  bachelor  master and doctoral programs in the disciplines of business  education  psychology  social sciences and health sciences 
our institutions deliver programs online as well as at their traditional campuses located in clinton  iowa and colorado springs  colorado 
as of december   our institutions offered approximately  courses  degree programs and specializations

see factors affecting comparability below 
we define enrollments as the number of active students on the last day of the financial reporting period 
a student is considered an active student if he or she has attended a class within the prior days unless the student has graduated or has provided us with notice of withdrawal 
key historical trends in results of operations we have experienced significant growth in enrollments  revenue and operating income  as well as improvement in liquidity since our acquisition of ashford university in march we believe our enrollment and revenue growth has been driven primarily by i our significant investment in enrollment advisors and online advertising which commenced immediately upon our acquisition of 
table of contents ashford university and ii students acceptance of our value proposition 
our significant growth in operating income is primarily a result of leveraging our fixed costs with increased revenue 
the growth that we experienced from the launch of ashford university first online program in continued throughout in  enrollment grew from  at december   to  at december   an increase of 
during  we had new student starts of approximately  in the last five years including  enrollment growth had a compound annual growth rate of 
while it would be difficult to maintain such a large growth rate  we expect to continue to grow in the next five years 
we believe that our dynamic structure allows us to expand our student base as needed  while maintaining the same high quality education for all our students 
our revenue has experienced similar growth rates between and  with a compound annual growth rate of 
we have significantly expanded our operations due to our continued growth since our launch 
in  we entered into leases for space in three buildings with an aggregate of  additional square feet 
additionally  we expanded our ashford university campus by constructing a new stadium on a portion of the land acquired in december we also purchased a building to be used as student housing to allow for additional students on the ashford university campus 
launch of constellation in may  we launched constellation  an innovative suite of interactive educational materials that will increase both the educational quality and affordability of an education for online students at its ashford university 
constellation web based course materials include both text and multimedia assets developed in cooperation with subject matter experts from across the country  as well as ashford university faculty 
constellation materials replace third party textbooks  which have typically cost online students per course 
with constellation  the cost is cut in half to during  we introduced eight courses  and plan to include core courses in approximately percent of degree programs over the next three years 
revenue generated from constellation was immaterial in  representing less than one percent of revenue 
liquidity and capital resources and anticipated capital expenditures we financed our operating activities and capital expenditures during and primarily through cash provided by operating activities 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million and no long term debt 
based on our current level of operations and anticipated growth in enrollments  we believe that our cash flow from operating activities  our existing cash and cash equivalents and other sources of liquidity will provide adequate funds for ongoing operations  planned capital expenditures and working capital requirements for at least the next months 
for the year ending december   we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million 
on july   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding shares of common stock over the following months 
during the year ended december   we repurchased million shares at a weighted average cost of per share  for a total purchase price of million 
approximately million remains authorized and available under the repurchase program 
as a result of the shares repurchased  diluted earnings per share increased  or  as a result of the fewer shares outstanding 
anticipated future trends in results of operations in recent years  we have seen student enrollments and revenue continue to increase despite difficult general economic conditions 
we have not seen any unfavorable impact from the fluctuation in general economic conditions on our liquidity  capital resources or results of operations 
while we 
table of contents cannot guarantee that these trends will continue  we believe that the performance of our company has been resilient in the current economic environment due to i the continued availability of title iv funds to finance student tuition payments  ii increased demand for postsecondary education resulting from a deteriorating labor market and iii efficiencies in advertising costs 
to meet the challenges of the current economy  we plan to continue to invest significantly in enrollment advisors and online and other advertising  which we expect will result in our total student enrollment and operating income continuing to grow  though perhaps not at the same rate as in the past  particularly given the larger size of our enrollment base and the changing regulatory environment  including any future changes in regulation over areas such as incentive compensation or gainful employment 
for more information on recent regulatory changes  see regulation department regulation of title iv programs in part i  item of this report and risk factors in part i  item a of this report 
as other institutions have disclosed  and as our pilot programs with revised compensation structures have indicated  we expect that our enrollment advisors new enrollment productivity will decline as a result of the changes in compensation methodology and that the majority of the impact will be realized in the second half of recent developments on march   we received correspondence from the us senate committee on health  education  labor and pensions inviting our ceo and president to testify at a hearing scheduled for march   regarding bridgepoint education  inc and ashford university 
key financial metrics revenue revenue consists principally of tuition  technology fees and other miscellaneous fees and is shown net of scholarships and refunds 
factors affecting our revenue include i the number of students who enroll and who remain enrolled in our courses  ii our degree and program mix  iii changes in our tuition rates  and iv the amount of the scholarships that we offer 
tuition is reduced by the amount of scholarships we award to our students 
enrollments we define enrollments as the number of active students on the last day of the financial reporting period 
a student is considered an active student if he or she has attended a class within the prior days unless the student has graduated or has provided us with a notice of withdrawal 
enrollments are a function of the number of continuing students at the beginning of each period and new enrollments during the period  which are offset by students who either graduated or withdrew during the period 
our online courses are typically five or six weeks in length and have weekly start dates through the year  with the exception of a two week break during the holiday period in late december and early january 
our campus based courses have one start per term  with two to five terms per year 
costs and expenses instructional costs and services 
instructional costs and services consist primarily of costs related to the administration and delivery of our educational programs 
this expense category includes compensation for campus based faculty and administrative personnel  costs associated with online faculty  curriculum and new program development costs  bad debt expense  financial aid processing costs  technology license costs and costs associated with other support groups that provide service directly to the students 
instructional costs and services also include an allocation of facility and depreciation costs 
marketing and promotional 
marketing and promotional expenses include compensation of personnel engaged in marketing and recruitment  as well as costs associated with purchasing leads and 
table of contents producing marketing materials 
our marketing and promotional expenses are generally affected by the cost of advertising media and leads  the efficiency of our marketing and recruiting efforts  salaries and benefits for our enrollment personnel and expenditures on advertising initiatives for new and existing academic programs 
advertising costs  consisting primarily of marketing leads  are expensed as incurred or the first time the advertising takes place 
we also incur immediate expenses in connection with new enrollment advisors while these individuals undergo training 
enrollment advisors typically do not achieve anticipated full productivity until four to six months after their dates of hire 
marketing and promotional costs also include an allocation of facility and depreciation costs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include compensation of employees engaged in corporate management  finance  human resources  information technology  compliance and other corporate functions 
general and administrative expenses also include professional services fees  travel and entertainment expenses and an allocation of facility and depreciation costs 
interest income 
interest income consists primarily of interest earned on investments 
interest expense 
interest expense consists primarily of interest charges on our line of credit and related fees 
factors affecting comparability we believe the following factors have had  or can be expected to have  a significant effect on the comparability of recent or future results of operations stock based compensation the amount of stock based compensation recognized in our consolidated statements of income has fluctuated year over year  primarily due to i the increase in fair market value of our common stock since  which has resulted in higher grant date fair values for our option awards under the black scholes option pricing model  ii the modification of certain stock options in march  as discussed below  and iii an increase in the number of stock options granted since becoming a public company 
on march   our board of directors amended the exit options for members of our management team to add an additional vesting condition so that the number of shares underlying the options that would not have vested upon the closing of our initial public offering  under the original terms of the options  would vest in full upon the closing of such offering 
this additional vesting condition constituted a modification 
accordingly  to the extent the exit option vested under the original vesting conditions  the original grant date fair value was recorded on the vesting date  and to the extent each exit option vested under the additional vesting condition  the modification date fair value would be recorded on the vesting date 
the compensation expense that was recorded for the exit options during the second quarter of was million 
such compensation expense was allocated to the expense category in which the optionee regular compensation is recorded 
settlement of stockholder dispute in february  certain holders of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock asserted various claims against us  our directors and officers and warburg pincus regarding amendments to our certificate of incorporation made in connection with financings in and certain stock options we granted to our employees 
the claimants represented of the holders of common stock and of the shares of common stock subject to warrants outstanding  in each case as of july  in march  we reached a settlement with the claimants regarding these claims and recorded a total expense of million related to the settlement during the three months ended 
table of contents march  after settling with the claimants  we notified the other holders of common stock and other holders of warrants to purchase shares of common stock  in each case as of july   regarding these claims  the settlement terms and their ability to participate in the settlement 
in april  we reached settlement with all of them 
public company expenses as a public company  we are obligated to file with the sec annual and quarterly information and other reports that are specified in section of the exchange act 
we are required to ensure that we have the ability to prepare financial statements that comply with sec reporting requirements on a timely basis 
we are also subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements  including the listing standards of the nyse and certain provisions of the sarbanes oxley act and the regulations promulgated thereunder  which impose significant compliance obligations upon us 
in addition  we have hired additional personnel and expand our administrative functions to become compliant  and maintain compliance  with the regulatory obligations of being a public company 
seasonality although not apparent in our results of operations due to our growth rate  our operations are generally subject to seasonal trends 
as our growth rate declines  we expect to experience seasonal fluctuations in results of operations as a result of changes in the level of student enrollment 
while we enroll students throughout the year  our fourth quarter revenue generally is lower than other quarters due to the holiday break in december 
we generally experience a seasonal increase in new enrollments in august and september of each year when most other colleges and universities begin their fall semesters 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates critical accounting policies are those policies that  in management view  are most important in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements also include disclosure of significant accounting policies 
the methods  estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our financial statements 
these critical accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue  bad debts  long lived assets  income taxes and stock based compensation 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the majority of our revenue comes from tuition revenue and is shown net of scholarships and refunds 
tuition revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the applicable period of instruction 
our online students generally enroll in a program that encompasses a series of five to six week courses that are taken consecutively over the length of the program 
students are billed on a course by course 
table of contents basis when first attending a class 
our traditional campus based students enroll in a program that encompasses a series of nine week or week courses 
these students are billed at the beginning of each term 
deferred revenue and student deposits represents tuition  fees and other student payments and unpaid amounts due less amounts recognized as revenue 
we recognize an account receivable and corresponding deferred revenue for the full amount of course tuition when a student first attends class 
payments that are received either directly from the student or from the student source of funding that exceed amounts billed are recognized as student deposits 
if a student withdraws from a program prior to certain dates  the student is entitled to a refund of certain portions of tuition  depending on the date the student last attended a class 
if an online student drops a class and the student last date of attendance was in the first week of class  the student receives a full refund of the tuition for that class 
if an online student drops a class and the last date of attendance was in the second week of the class  the student receives a refund of of the tuition for that class 
if an online student drops a class and the student last date of attendance was after the second week of the class  the student is not entitled to a refund 
we monitor student attendance in online courses through activity in the online program associated with that course 
after two weeks have passed without attendance in a class by the student  the student is presumed to have dropped the course as of the last date of attendance  and the student tuition is automatically refunded to the extent the student is entitled to a refund based on the refund policy above 
we estimate expected refunds based on historical refund rates and record a provision to reduce revenue for the amount that is expected to be refunded 
refunds issued by us for services that have been provided in a prior period have not historically been material 
future changes in the rate of student withdrawals may result in a change to expected refunds and would be accounted for prospectively as a change in estimate 
we also recognize revenue from technology fees that are one time start up fees charged to each new online student  other than military and scholarship students and students affiliated with certain corporate reimbursement programs 
technology fee revenue is recognized ratably over the average expected term of a student 
the average expected term of the student is estimated each quarter based upon historical student duration of attendance and qualitative factors as deemed necessary 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from students inability to pay us for services performed  or for inability of students to repay excess funds received for stipends 
bad debt expense is recorded as a component of instructional costs and services 
we calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical collection experience and changes in the economic environment 
we also consider other factors such as the age of the receivable  the type of receivable and the students active or inactive enrollment status 
certain variables require management judgment and include inherent uncertainties such as the likelihood of future student attendance and students ability to qualify for title iv eligibility 
variations in these factors from our historical experience may impact future estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable and may cause actual losses due to write offs of uncollectible accounts to differ from past estimates 
impairments of long lived assets we assess potential impairment to our long lived assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could cause us to assess potential impairment include significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends 
an impairment loss is recorded when the carrying amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use 
table of contents and eventual disposition of the asset 
any required impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and an expense to operating results 
we use various assumptions in determining undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset  including assumptions regarding revenue growth rates  operating costs  certain capital additions  assumed discount rates  disposition or terminal value and other economic factors 
these variables require management judgment and include inherent uncertainties such as continuing acceptance of our value proposition by prospective students  our ability to manage operating costs and the impact of changes in the economy on our business 
a variation in the assumptions used could lead to a different conclusion regarding the realizability of an asset and  thus  could have a significant effect on our conclusions regarding whether an asset is impaired and the amount of impairment loss recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
significant judgments are required in determining the consolidated provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain 
as a result  we recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due 
these tax liabilities are recognized when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable  we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities 
we believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law 
this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations  such differences will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made 
we evaluate and account for uncertain tax positions using a two step approach 
recognition step one occurs when we conclude that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
measurement step two determines the amount of benefit that is greater than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when we subsequently determine that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold of being sustained 
we are required to file income tax returns in the united states and in various state income tax jurisdictions 
the preparation of these income tax returns requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions  which could affect the amount of tax paid by us 
the income tax returns  however  are subject to audits by the various federal and state taxing authorities 
as part of these reviews  the taxing authorities may disagree with our tax positions 
the ultimate resolution of these tax positions is often uncertain until the audit is complete and any disagreements are resolved 
we therefore record an amount for our estimate of the additional tax liability  including interest and penalties  for any uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return 
we review and update the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes available from taxing authorities  completion of tax audits and expiration of statutes of limitations 
we record interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
in addition to estimates inherent in the recognition of current taxes payable  we estimate the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets each reporting period 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income 
to the extent we believe it is 
table of contents more likely than not that some portion or all of our net deferred tax assets will not be realized  we establish a valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence including past operating results  estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies 
we recognize windfall tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders equity only when realized 
a windfall tax benefit occurs when the actual tax benefit realized by us upon an employee disposition of a share based award exceeds the deferred tax asset  if any  associated with the award that we had recorded 
when assessing whether a tax benefit relating to share based compensation has been realized  we follow the tax law ordering method  under which current year share based compensation deductions are assumed to be utilized before net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes 
stock based compensation we grant options to purchase our common stock to certain employees and directors under our equity incentive plans 
the benefits provided under these plans are share based payments and are recorded in our consolidated statement of income based upon their fair values 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date fair value of the award and is expensed over the vesting period 
we estimate the fair value of stock options awards on the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date under this model requires judgment  including estimating our volatility  employee stock option exercise behaviors and forfeiture rates 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
our computation of expected term was calculated using the simplified method 
the risk free interest rate is based on the united states treasury yield of those maturities that are consistent with the expected term of the stock option in effect on the grant date of the award 
dividend rates are based upon historical dividend trends and expected future dividends 
as we have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future  a zero dividend rate is assumed in our calculation 
because our stock has not been publicly traded for a significant period of time and we had no substantial historical data on the volatility of our stock as of december   our expected volatility is estimated by analyzing the historical volatility of comparable public companies  which we refer to as guideline companies 
in evaluating the comparability of the guideline companies  we consider factors such as industry  stage of life cycle  size and financial leverage 
the amount of stock based compensation expense we recognize during a period is based on the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
we estimate option forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the effect of a change in estimates to any of the individual inputs to the black scholes option pricing model would not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
options awarded under our equity incentive plans have an exercise price that equals or exceeds the closing price of our common stock  as reported by the nyse  on the date of grant

available borrowing facilities on january   we entered into a million revolving line of credit with comerica bank  or comerica  pursuant to a credit agreement  revolving credit note and security agreement  which agreements  as amended to date  we collectively refer to as the loan documents 
for more information about the loan documents  see note  notes payable and long term debt  to our annual consolidated financial statements  which are included elsewhere in this report 
the initial proceeds under the loan documents were used  in part  to refinance the outstanding letters of credit under the existing credit agreement between us and comerica  which we refer to as the prior agreement 
upon the effectiveness of the loan documents  the prior agreement was terminated  except that letters of credit outstanding under the prior agreement were deemed to be letters of credit issued under the loan documents 
as of december   we used the availability under the revolving credit facility to issue letters of credit aggregating million 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants in the loan documents and had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of december  as part of our normal business operations  we are required to provide surety bonds in certain states where we do business

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market and credit risk pursuant to our cash investment policy  we attempt to mitigate the exposure of our cash and investments to market and credit risk by i diversifying concentration risk to ensure that we are not overly concentrated in a limited number of financial institutions  ii monitoring and managing the risks associated with the national banking and credit markets  iii investing in us dollar denominated assets and instruments only  iv diversifying account structures so that we maintain a decentralized account portfolio with numerous stable  highly rated and liquid financial institutions and v ensuring that our investment procedures maintain a defined and specific scope such that we will not invest in higher risk investment accounts  including long term corporate bonds  financial swaps or derivative and corporate equities 
accordingly  under the guidelines of the policy  we invest our excess cash exclusively in high quality  us dollar denominated financial instruments 
despite the investment risk mitigation strategies we employ  we may incur investment losses as a result of unusual and unpredictable market developments and we may experience reduced investment earnings if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain low or decline further in this time of economic uncertainty 
in addition  unusual and unpredictable market developments may also create liquidity challenges for certain of the assets in our investment portfolio 
we have no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments 
interest rate risk to the extent we borrow funds under our lines of credit with comerica  we would be subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
see part ii  item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
as of december   we had no borrowings under the line of credit with comerica 
our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates 
at december   a increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our future earnings  fair value or cash flows related to interest earned from cash  cash equivalents or marketable securities
