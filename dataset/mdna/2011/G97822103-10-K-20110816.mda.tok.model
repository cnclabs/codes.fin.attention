competition the market for generic prescription drugs is subject to intense competition from other generic drug manufacturers  brand name pharmaceutical companies launching their own generic version of a branded product known as an authorized generic  manufacturers of branded drug products that continue to produce those products after patent expirations and manufacturers of therapeutically similar drugs 
among the company s competitors in the topical generics market are actavis us  fougera  glenmark generics inc  sandoz  taro pharmaceutical  teva  tolmar and triax pharmaceuticals  as well as brand name pharmaceutical companies where the company offers a generic equivalent 
the company believes that one of its primary competitive advantages is its ability to introduce difficult to develop and or manufacture topical generic equivalents to brand name drug products 
generally  these products are exposed to less competition due to the relatively longer development  clinical trial and approval processes 
in addition  the company believes it has a favorable competitive position due primarily to its efficient distribution systems  topical production economies of scale  customer service and overall reputation 
price competition from additional generic versions of the same product  as well as potential price competition from the original branded or authorized generic products  may result in a significant and or rapid decline in sales and profit margins 
in addition  competitors may also develop their products more rapidly or complete the regulatory approval process sooner and market their products earlier than the company 
new drugs and future developments in improved and or advanced drug delivery technologies or other therapeutic techniques may provide therapeutic or cost advantages to competing products 
many brand name competitors try to prevent  discourage or delay the use of generic equivalents through various measures  including introduction of new branded products  legislative initiatives  changing dosage forms or dosing regimens just prior to introduction of a generic equivalent  regulatory processes  filing new patents or patent extensions  law suits  citizens petitions and negative publicity 
in addition  brand name companies sometimes launch  either through an affiliate or licensing arrangements with another company  an authorized generic at or near the time the first generic product is launched depriving the generic product marketed of exclusivity intended by the hatch waxman amendments to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act hatch waxman 
see information applicable to all reported segments government regulation us food and drug administration below 
many of the company s customers  which include chain drug stores  wholesalers  distributors  hospital systems and group purchasing organizations  continue to merge or consolidate

as a result of these developments  heightened competition exists among generic drug producers for business from this smaller and more selective customer base 
active pharmaceutical ingredients the company develops  manufactures and markets api used worldwide by the generic drug industry and branded pharmaceutical companies 
certain of these ingredients are used in its own pharmaceutical products 
the manufacturing of these api occurs primarily in israel 
in addition  the company is in the process of transitioning certain api products previously manufactured in germany to its new facility in india  as discussed below 
significant developments over the past several years  the company has been developing the api temozolomide for various finished dose partners in several global markets 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company launched temozolomide into the european market 
on february   the company announced that it would exclusively supply teva with the api for the generic version of temodar temozolomide in the us market 
teva will manufacture  market and distribute the product in the us  and the company will share equally with teva in the profitability of the product sold 
teva was the first company to file an anda that contained a paragraph iv certification for temodar and is eligible to receive day hatch waxman statutory exclusivity to market this product in the us on january   the united states district court for the district of delaware held that the patent protecting temozolomide was unenforceable 
on march   the fda granted final approval to the teva anda  but teva did not launch the product at that time 
merck appealed the ruling and on november   the appeals court reversed the trial decision  preventing the launch of the teva product 
teva filed a petition for the entire appeals court to rehear the case  and on february  the court denied the motion 
teva is considering whether to appeal the appeals court ruling to the united states supreme court 
by agreement reached between teva and merck  teva will not be able to launch the product until august  except in limited circumstances 
the company expects its share in the profits of the product could have a material positive impact on its operating results  however  the magnitude and timing of the profits the company could realize are uncertain and are subject to factors beyond the company control  including  but not limited to  the timing of the product launch date by teva in the us in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company evaluated the api business in the context of the expected future competitive dynamics in api and the company s strategic focus on specialty molecules and vertical integration 
management determined that the german api facility was no longer competitive from a global cost position 
at that time  the company did not anticipate that there would be a viable market for the sale of this facility and related operations  and accordingly  the company planned to cease all operations at the facility during the first quarter of fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  however  the company was approached by an external party who offered to buy the german api facility and related operations from the company 
subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal  the company signed an agreement and closed the transaction with the third party buyer for the sale of the german api facility and related operations 
as part of its german restructuring plan  the company incurred net charges of  and  in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  respectively 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the sale of the german api facility and related operations 
to further improve the long term cost position of its api business  on august   the company acquired an stake in vedants drug fine chemicals private limited vedants  an api manufacturing facility in india  for  in cash 
the facility  located approximately miles outside of mumbai  is currently under construction and will manufacture the company s current and future high volume api products  as well as expand the company s vertical integration of rx and future candidate rx to otc switch products 
manufacturing of api at this facility is expected to begin in the second half of fiscal and will include certain api products currently manufactured in israel and those that had been manufactured in germany 
the company actively enters into exclusive marketing and sales agreements dossier agreements related to specific product formulations  for specific geographic areas  for specific periods of time 
the company recognized revenue related to certain dossier agreements of approximately   and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company intends to continue pursuing similar types of agreements in the future 
api business the api business identifies apis that will be critical to its pharmaceutical customers future product launches and then works closely with these customers on the development processes 
api development is focused on the synthesis of less common molecules for the us  european and other international markets 
the company is also focusing development activities on the synthesis of molecules for use in its own otc and rx pipeline products 
this vertical integration may enable the company to be more competitive on pricing of its other product lines and to broaden its growth and profit opportunities 
the company believes it has a competitive advantage in its ability to produce difficult to develop products through its understanding of regulatory issues  patents  and chemistry 
because of the difficulty in developing these products and the related regulatory challenges  the lead time to market a product can be long 
the company s ability to continue to develop and market new products that have lower levels of competition is key to driving profitability in the api business 
the api business sells to customers who face similar regulatory oversight as the company s rx pharmaceuticals business 
as a result  the api business is dependent on these customers ability to obtain proper product approvals and maintain regulatory compliance with the fda  the ftc  and the us drug enforcement administration dea  as well as several foreign  state and local agencies in localities in which the company s products are sold 
because the company s api customers depend on high quality supply and regulatory support  the company focuses on rigorous quality assurance  quality control and regulatory compliance as part of its strategic positioning 
the company s quality system is designed to comply with the regulatory requirements of the fda  the european medicines agency and the australian therapeutic goods administration 
the company is regularly inspected by various regulatory authorities and customers 
the company places a high priority on responding to client needs and requirements from project initiation through final production 
it offers support throughout the development stage  preparation of drug master files dmf and assistance throughout the approval process 
the api segment is supported by sales offices in the us and israel and sales agents in various other countries 
the company currently manufactures and markets to generic and branded pharmaceutical companies worldwide the following api products ammonium lactate levocetirizine dihydrochloride anastrozole midazolam base azacitidine midazolam hydrochloride cetirizine dihydrochloride midazolam maleate cilostazol modafinil cisatracurium mometasone furoate donepezil hydrochloride montelukast sodium exemestane moxonidine fenofibrate pentoxifylline flumazenil pramipexole dihydrochloride fluticasone propionate r modafinil gemcitabine rocuronium bromide granisetron hydrochloride temozolomide halobetasol terbinafine hydrochloride imiquimod tramadol hydrochloride lamotrigine zonisamide letrozole new product introductions net sales related to new products were approximately  for fiscal   for fiscal  and  for fiscal fiscal new product sales primarily relate to sales of temozolomide to the european market  which the company launched during the third quarter of fiscal an api product is considered new if it was added to the company s product lines or sold to a new geographic area with different regulatory authorities within months prior to the end of the period for which net sales are being measured 
competition the api segment operates in a highly competitive  price sensitive market in which the company s customers continue to consolidate and or vertically integrate  thereby creating a smaller customer base 
since other manufacturers of api typically do not offer all of the same product lines or serve all of the same markets as the company s api segment  the segment competes on a product by product basis with a number of different competitors 
the company s api business is subject to increased price competition from other manufacturers of api located mostly in india  china and europe 
this competition may result in the loss of api clients and or decreased profitability in this business segment 
however  the company believes that its regulatory position  market reputation  client relationships and ability to manufacture difficult to develop api provide it with a favorable competitive position 
other the company has an other category comprised of israel pharmaceutical and diagnostic products  which does not meet the quantitative threshold required to be a separately reportable segment 
israel pharmaceutical and diagnostic products includes the marketing and manufacturing of branded prescription drugs under long term exclusive licenses and the importation of pharmaceutical  diagnostics and other medical products into israel based on exclusive agreements with the manufacturers 
asset acquisitions on july   the company s israel pharmaceutical and diagnostic products operating segment entered into a distribution agreement with a major global diagnostic company 
in conjunction with this distribution agreement  the company acquired certain pharmaceutical diagnostic assets from a local pharmaceutical company for  in addition  on november   in connection with this same distribution agreement  the company s israel pharmaceutical and diagnostic products operating segment acquired certain pharmaceutical diagnostic assets from another local pharmaceutical company for  these acquisitions enhanced the company s product portfolio and strengthened its position as the leader in the israeli pharmaceutical diagnostic market 
the assets acquired in these transactions consist primarily of intangible assets associated with customer supply contracts  machinery and equipment and inventory 
the assets acquired in connection with the july and november distribution agreements and the operating results generated therefrom were included in the other category in the company s consolidated financial statements beginning in the first and second quarter of fiscal  respectively 
discontinued operations in march  the company committed to a plan to sell its israel consumer products business 
israel consumer products consisted of cosmetics  toiletries  bar soaps and detergents generally sold under the company s brand names careline  neca and natural formula 
the financial results of this business  which were previously reported as part of the company s other category  have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
the assets and liabilities of this business are reflected as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented 
on february   the company completed the sale of its israel consumer products business to emilia group  a subsidiary of o 
feller holdings ltd  for approximately  of which approximately  is contingent upon satisfaction of contingency factors specified in the agreement 
after finalization of post closing working capital adjustments in the third quarter of fiscal  the sale resulted in a pre tax loss of  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations 
competition the company s other category operates in competitive markets 
these markets are based primarily in israel but are also subject to competition from large multi national companies looking to expand their position in the local israeli market 
in most instances  these companies are significantly larger than the company on a global basis with greater financial resources and product lines 
the company also has several significant product supply agreements with outside vendors 
as a result  the company s competitive position is largely dependent on its ability to maintain these agreements 
the company believes that its competitive advantages consist of its historical knowledge of the local markets and strong local brand recognition 
information applicable to all reportable segments research and development research and development are key components of the company s business strategy and  while managed centrally on a global basis  are performed in various locations in the us and abroad 
development for both the consumer healthcare and nutritionals markets focuses on products comparable in formulation  quality and effectiveness to existing national brand otc products  nutritional supplement products  infant formulas and rx to otc switch products 
development of generic prescription drugs  primarily for the us market  focuses on complex formulations  many of which require costly clinical endpoint trials 
development of api for the global market also focuses on complex products with high barriers to entry 
while the company conducts a significant amount of its own research and development  it also enters into strategic alliance agreements to obtain the rights to manufacture and or distribute new products 
research and development spending was  for fiscal   for fiscal and  for fiscal in addition  fiscal included charges of  and  for the write offs of in process research and development related to the andas acquired from kv pharmaceuticals and novel  respectively  and fiscal included a charge for the write off of in process research and development related to the diba acquisition 
the fiscal and increases in research and development costs were both due to increased investment in the development of new drugs  primarily in the consumer healthcare segment  along with incremental research and development associated with acquisitions in fiscal and the company anticipates that research and development expenditures  including legal costs associated with defending paragraph iv patent litigation  will increase above fiscal levels in dollar terms but remain relatively flat as a percentage of sales in the foreseeable future as the company continues to cultivate its presence in the generic pharmaceutical market and to develop its internal research and development capabilities 
trademarks and patents the company owns certain trademarks and patents  however  its business as a whole is not materially dependent upon its ownership of any one trademark or patent or group of trademarks or patents 
significant customers the company believes its primary customer base aligns with the concentration of large drug retailers in the current marketplace of the retail drug industry 
walmart accounted for of consolidated net sales for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal should walmart s current relationship with the company change adversely  the resulting loss of business would have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated operating results and financial position 
the company does not anticipate such a change in the foreseeable future 
in addition  while no other customer individually comprises more than of total net sales  the company does have other significant customers 
if the company s relationship with one or more of these other customers  including the terms for doing business with the customers  changes significantly  it could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
manufacturing and distribution the company s primary manufacturing facilities are located in the us and israel see item a 
risk factors conditions in israel for further information 
the company also has secondary manufacturing facilities located in the uk  mexico and australia  along with joint ventures located in china and india 
the company supplements its production capabilities with the purchase of product from outside sources 
during fiscal  the approximate average capacity utilization was and for the company s facilities in the us and israel  respectively 
the capacity of some facilities may be fully utilized at certain times due to various reasons  such as customer demand  the seasonality of the cough cold flu season and new product launches 
the company may utilize available capacity by contract manufacturing for other companies 
the company has logistics facilities located in the us  israel  the uk  mexico and australia 
both contract freight and common carriers are used to deliver products 
seasonality revenues in the company s consumer healthcare segment are generally subject to the seasonal demands for cough cold flu and allergy products in its second and third fiscal quarters 
historically  the company s sales of these products have varied from year to year based in large part on the severity and length of the cough cold flu season 
while the company believes that the severity and length of the cough cold flu season will continue to impact its sales of cough cold flu and allergy products  there can be no assurance that the company s future sales of these products will necessarily follow historical patterns 
revenues for the nutritionals  rx pharmaceuticals and api segments  as well as the other category  are generally not impacted significantly by seasonal conditions 
materials sourcing high quality raw materials and packaging components are essential to all of the company s business units due to the nature of the products it manufactures 
raw materials and packaging components are generally available from multiple suppliers 
while the company has the ability to manufacture and supply certain api materials for the consumer healthcare and rx pharmaceuticals segments  certain components and finished goods are purchased rather than manufactured because of temporary production limitations  fda restrictions or economic and other factors 
supplies of certain raw materials  bulk tablets and components are limited  or are available from one or only a few suppliers 
historically  the company has been able to react to situations that require alternate sourcing 
should alternate sourcing be required  fda requirements placed on products approved through the anda or nda process could substantially lengthen the approval of an alternate source and adversely affect financial results 
the company has good  cooperative working relationships with substantially all of its suppliers and has historically been able to capitalize on economies of scale in the purchase of materials and supplies due to its volume of purchases 
environmental the company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations 
the company believes that the costs for complying with such laws and regulations will not be material to the business of the company 
the company does not have any material remediation liabilities outstanding 
in march and june of  lawsuits were filed by three separate groups against both the state of israel and the council of ramat hovav in connection with waste disposal and pollution from several companies  including the company  that have operations in the ramat hovav region of israel 
these lawsuits were subsequently consolidated into a single proceeding in the district court of beer sheva 
the council of ramat hovav in june  and the state of israel  in november  asserted third party claims against several companies  including the company 
the pleadings allege a variety of personal injuries arising out of the alleged environmental pollution 
neither the plaintiffs nor the third party claimants were required to specify a maximum amount of damages  but the pleadings allege damages in excess of  subject to foreign currency fluctuations between the israeli shekel and the us dollar 
while the company intends to vigorously defend against these claims  the company cannot reasonably predict at this time the outcome or the liability  if any  associated with these claims 
government regulation the manufacturing  processing  formulation  packaging  labeling  testing  storing  distributing  advertising and sale of the company s products are subject to regulation by one or more us agencies  including the fda  the ftc  the dea and the consumer product safety commission cpsc  as well as several foreign  state and local agencies in localities in which the company s products are sold 
in addition  the company manufactures and markets certain of its products in accordance with standards set by organizations  such as the united states pharmacopeial convention  inc usp and nsf international nsf 
the company believes that its policies  operations and products comply in all material respects with existing regulations 
us food and drug administration the fda has jurisdiction over the company s anda  nda and otc monograph drug products  dietary supplements  infant formulas and medical food products 
the fda s jurisdiction extends to the manufacturing  testing  labeling  packaging  storage and distribution of these products 
otc and generic prescription pharmaceuticals 
many of the company s otc pharmaceutical products are regulated under the otc monograph system and subject to certain fda regulations 
otc monographs have been established through the fda s otc review utilizing the notice and comment rulemaking procedures 
under the otc monograph system  selected otc drugs are generally recognized as safe and effective and do not require the submission and approval of an anda or nda prior to marketing 
the fda otc monographs include well known ingredients and specify requirements for permitted indications  required warnings and precautions  allowable combinations of ingredients and dosage levels 
drug products marketed under the otc monograph system must conform to specific quality  formula and labeling requirements  however  these products generally can be developed with fewer regulatory hurdles than those products that require the filing of an anda or nda 
it is  in general  less costly to develop and bring to market a product produced under the otc monograph system 
from time to time  adequate information may become available to the fda regarding certain anda or nda drug products that will allow the reclassification of those products as no longer requiring the approval of an anda or nda prior to marketing 
for this reason  there may be increased competition and lower profitability related to a particular product should it be reclassified to the otc monograph system 
in addition  regulations may change from time to time  requiring formulation  packaging or labeling changes for certain products 
the company cannot predict whether new legislation regulating the company s activities will be enacted or what effect any legislation would have on the company s business 
the company also markets generic prescription drugs and other products that have switched from prescription to otc status through an application process initiated by the innovator company that holds the original clinical trial data 
these products require approval by the fda through its anda or nda processes prior to commercialization 
based on current fda regulations  andas and ndas provide information on chemistry  manufacturing and change control  bioequivalence  packaging and labeling 
the development process for a generic drug generally requires less time and expense than the development process for a new drug 
for approval of an anda  the company must demonstrate that the product is bioequivalent to a marketed product that has previously been approved by the fda and that the company s manufacturing process meets fda standards 
the approval process for an anda may require that bioequivalence studies be performed using a small number of subjects in a controlled clinical environment  and for certain topical generic products  demonstration of efficacy in comparative full end point clinical studies 
depending on the specific product  other types of studies may be required by the fda 
approval time for the industry currently averages months from the date an anda is submitted  an increase from months a year ago 
changes to a product marketed under an anda or nda are governed by specific fda regulations and guidelines that define when proposed changes can be implemented and whether prior fda notice and or approval is required 
under the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of the hatch waxman amendments to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  a company submitting an nda can obtain a three year period of marketing exclusivity for an rx product or an rx to otc switch product if the company performs a clinical study that is essential to fda approval of the nda 
longer periods of exclusivity are possible for new chemical entities and orphan drugs 
these exclusivity periods prevent other companies from obtaining approval of any andas for a similar or equivalent generic product 
where three years of exclusivity is granted to the initiating company  the company will be unable to market the product unless the company establishes a relationship with the company having exclusive marketing rights 
there can be no assurance that  in the event the company applies for fda approvals  the company will obtain the approvals to market rx  rx to otc switch products or otc anda products or  alternatively  that the company will be able to obtain these products from other manufacturers 
under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act ffdca  a manufacturer may obtain an additional six months which  under certain circumstances  may be extended to one year of exclusivity if the innovator conducts pediatric studies requested by the fda on the product 
this exclusivity will  in certain instances  delay fda approval and the sales by the company of certain anda and other products 
if the company is first to file its anda and meets certain requirements relating to the patents owned or licensed by the brand company  the company may be entitled to a day generic exclusivity period for that product 
when a company submits an anda  the company is required to include a patent certification to certain patents that are identified with the innovator product 
if the anda applicant challenges the validity of the innovator s patent or certifies that its product does not infringe the patent  the product innovator may sue for infringement 
the legal action would not ordinarily result in material damages but could prevent the company from introducing the product if it is not successful in the legal action 
the company would  however  incur the cost of defending the legal action and that action could have the effect of triggering a statutorily mandated delay in fda approval of the anda for a period of up to months from when the innovator was notified of the patent challenge 
in addition  if exclusivity is granted to the company  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to market the product at the beginning of the exclusivity period or that the exclusivity will not be shared with other generic companies  including authorized generics 
it is possible that more than one applicant files the first anda on the same day and exclusivity is shared 
this may happen by chance  but more likely when there is a certain type of innovator exclusivity that prevents the filing of all andas until a specific date 
as a result of events that are outside of the company s control  the company may forfeit its exclusivity 
finally  if the company is not first to file its anda  the fda may grant day exclusivity to another company  thereby effectively delaying the launch of the company s product 
the company s prescription drug products that are marketed without approved applications must meet certain manufacturing and labeling standards established by the fda 
the fda s policy with respect to the continued marketing of unapproved products is stated in the fda s june compliance policy guide  titled marketed new drugs without approved ndas or andas 
under this policy  the fda has stated that it will follow a risk based approach with regard to enforcement against such unapproved products 
the fda evaluates whether to initiate enforcement action on a case by case basis  but gives higher priority to enforcement action against products in certain categories  such as those marketed as unapproved drugs with potential safety risks or that lack evidence of effectiveness 
the fda recognizes that certain unapproved products  based on the introduction date of their active ingredients and the lack of safety concerns  among other things  have been marketed for many years and  at this time  might not be subject to immediate enforcement action 
see further information in item a 
risk factors 
all facilities where rx and otc drugs are manufactured  tested  packaged  stored or distributed must comply with fda cgmps and regulations promulgated by competent authorities in the countries where the facilities are located 
all of the company s drug products are manufactured  tested  packaged  stored and distributed according to cgmp regulations 
the fda performs periodic audits to ensure that the company s facilities remain in compliance with all appropriate regulations 
the failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to a breach of representations made to store brand customers or to regulatory action against the company related to the products made in that facility  including suspension of or delay in anda approvals  seizure  injunction or recall 
serious product quality concerns could also result in governmental actions against the company that  among other things  could result in the suspension of production or distribution of the company s products  product seizures  loss of certain licenses or other governmental penalties  and could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or operating results 
in addition  several bills have been introduced in congress that could  if enacted  affect the manufacture and marketing of rx and otc drugs 
the company cannot predict whether new legislation regulating the company s activities will be enacted or what effect any legislation would have on the company s business 
the company submits a dmf for active pharmaceutical ingredients to be commercialized in the us the dmf filings provide an efficient mechanism for fda review while protecting the company s proprietary information related to the manufacturing process 
the manufacturing facilities are inspected by the fda to assess cgmp compliance 
the manufacturing facilities and production procedures utilized at the manufacturing facilities must meet current fda good manufacturing practice gmp standards before products may be exported to the us for european markets  the company submits a european dmf and  where applicable  obtains a certificate of suitability from the european directorate for the quality of medicines 
the manufacturing facilities and production procedures for api marketed in europe must meet eu gmp and european pharmacopeia standards 
infant formula 
the fda s center for food safety and applied nutrition is responsible for the regulation of infant formula 
the office of nutritional products  labeling and dietary supplements onplds has program responsibility for infant formula  while the office of food additive safety ofas has program responsibility for food ingredients and packaging 
the onplds evaluates whether the infant formula manufacturer has met the requirements under the ffdca and consults with the ofas regarding the safety of ingredients in infant formula and of packaging materials for infant formula 
all manufacturers of pediatric nutrition products must begin with safe food ingredients  which are either generally recognized as safe or approved as food additives 
the specific requirements for infant formula are governed by the infant formula act of  as amended formula act 
the purpose of the formula act is to ensure the safety and nutrition of infant formulas  including minimum  and in some cases  maximum levels of specified nutrients 
once an infant formula product is formulated  the manufacturer must provide regulatory agencies assurance of the nutritional quality of that particular formulation before marketing the infant formula 
the fda has established requirements for certain labeling  nutrient content  manufacturer quality control procedures to assure the nutrient content of infant formulas  as well as for company records and reports 
a manufacturer must notify the fda days before the first processing of any infant formula that differs fundamentally in processing or in composition from any previous formulation produced by the manufacturer 
the fda currently is finalizing incremental good manufacturing practices  quality control procedures  quality factors  notification requirements  and reports and records  for the production of infant formulas 
the company is monitoring the situation and will make appropriate adjustments to remain in compliance 
in addition  as part of its responsibility to implement the provisions of the ffdca  the fda continuously monitors infant formula products 
the ffdca requires infant formula manufacturers to test product composition during production and shelf life  to keep records on production  testing and distribution of each batch of infant formula and to use good manufacturing practices and quality control procedures 
in addition  the ffdca requires infant formula manufacturers to maintain records of all complaints  some of which are reviewed to reveal the possible existence of a hazard to health 
the fda conducts yearly inspections of all facilities that manufacture infant formula 
the fda also inspects new facilities during early production runs 
as part of the inspection  the fda collects and analyzes samples of infant formula 
dietary supplements 
the dietary supplement health and education act of dshea amended the ffdca to  among other things define dietary supplements and dietary ingredients  require ingredient and nutrition labeling for dietary supplements  permit structure function statements for dietary supplements  permit the display of certain published literature where supplements are sold  authorize the fda to establish gmps specifically for dietary supplements  and require the submission of new dietary ingredient notification to the fda 
the dshea provides specific nutrition labeling requirements for dietary supplements that are slightly different than those for conventional foods 
all supplements must bear a supplement facts box  which must list all of the supplement s dietary ingredients using nomenclature as specified in fda regulations 
dshea also permits dietary supplements to bear statements claiming a benefit related to a classical nutrient deficiency disease  provided the prevalence of the disease in the us is disclosed  describing the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient intended to affect the structure or function in humans  characterizing the documented mechanism by which a nutrient or dietary ingredient acts to maintain such structure or function  and describing general well being from consumption of a nutrient or dietary ingredient 
the company is subject to regulations published by the fda clarifying the types of structure function statements permissible in dietary supplement labeling 
such statements cannot expressly or implicitly state that a dietary supplement has any effect on a disease 
as with foods in general  dietary supplement labeling may include a health claim  which characterizes the role of a nutrient to a disease or health related condition 
there are two types of health claims health claims authorized by fda regulations based on significant scientific agreement among qualified scientific experts  and qualified health claims  which may be made with a lower level of substantiation  provided that the fda does not object to the claims 
in each case  the health claim must be reviewed and approved by the fda before it may be used 
on june   the fda issued final gmp regulations specific to dietary supplements  which became effective as they relate to the company on june  the company continues to invest in its dietary supplement operations to ensure compliance with the regulations 
the fda began inspecting the industry after the june  compliance date 
the company continuously monitors fda activities  including publicly available inspection reports of other companies inspections  to ensure that its operations and quality systems are maintained in a state of compliance based on the current interpretation of the regulations 
the company has not yet been inspected and cannot determine with certainty what effects the fda s future interpretations of the regulations will have on its business 
the gmp regulations and fda s future interpretations of these regulations could  among other things  require expanded documentation of the manufacturing processes for certain products or additional analytical testing for certain ingredients 
in addition  several bills have been introduced in congress that could  if enacted  affect the manufacture and marketing of dietary supplements 
the company cannot predict whether new legislation regulating the company s activities will be enacted or what effect any legislation would have on the company s business 
the dshea requires that the fda be notified at least days in advance of the introduction of a dietary supplement that contains a dietary ingredient that was introduced to market after october  or was present in the food supply in a form where the food had not been chemically altered 
the notification must provide information establishing that the dietary supplement containing the dietary ingredient will reasonably be expected to be safe 
us drug enforcement administration the dea regulates certain drug products containing controlled substances  such as testosterone  and list i chemicals  such as pseudoephedrine  pursuant to the federal controlled substances act csa 
the csa and dea regulations impose specific requirements on manufacturers and other entities that handle these substances including registration  recordkeeping  reporting  storage  security and distribution 
recordkeeping requirements include accounting for the amount of product received  manufactured  stored and distributed 
companies handling either controlled substances or list i chemicals are also required to maintain adequate security and to report suspicious orders  thefts and significant losses 
the dea periodically inspects facilities for compliance with the csa and its regulations 
failure to comply with current and future regulations of the dea could lead to a variety of sanctions  including revocation or denial of renewal of dea registrations  injunctions  or civil or criminal penalties 
the company is subject to the requirements of the csa and dea regulations in the handling of any controlled substances in schedules ii v or any of the list i chemicals identified in the csa 
specifically  the company is subject to regulation in the current manufacture and distribution of products containing pseudoephedrine  a list i chemical 
as a result of a series of amendments to the csa  the dea has imposed increased restrictions on the manufacture and distribution of pseudoephedrine products 
for example  the comprehensive methamphetamine control act of was enacted to authorize the dea to monitor transactions involving chemicals that may be used illegally in the production of methamphetamine 
the comprehensive methamphetamine control act of establishes certain registration and recordkeeping requirements for manufacturers of otc cold  allergy  asthma and diet medicines that contain ephedrine  pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine ppa 
while certain of the company s otc drug products contain pseudoephedrine  which is a common ingredient in decongestant products  the company s us products contain neither ephedrine nor ppa 
in addition  the reauthorization act of  signed into law on march   prevented the existing provisions of the patriot act from expiring and also included the combat methamphetamine epidemic act 
this law further amended the csa and provided additional requirements on the manufacture  distribution and sale of pseudoephedrine products 
among the various provisions  this national legislation places certain restrictions on the purchase and sale of all products that contain ephedrine  pseudoephedrine or ppa list i chemical products 
the csa also imposed import and procurement quotas for list i chemicals  including pseudoephedrine 
the csa  as amended  also imposed daily restrictions on the amount of list i chemical products a retailer may sell to a consumer grams per day and limitations on the amount of list i chemical products a consumer may purchase grams over a day period 
further  effective september   the act requires that a retail sellers maintain a logbook that tracks the sales of list i chemical products to individuals  and b purchasers provide valid identification in order to purchase list i chemical products 
many states have also enacted legislation regulating the manufacture and distribution of pseudoephedrine products 
the company is subject to these state requirements as well 
medicaid drug rebate program and other drug pricing programs federal law requires that a pharmaceutical manufacturer  as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the states for the manufacturer s drugs under medicaid and medicare part b  must enter into a rebate agreement to pay rebates to state medicaid programs for the manufacturer s covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state medicaid program under a fee for service arrangement 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms is responsible for administering the medicaid rebate agreements between the federal government and pharmaceutical manufacturers 
rebates are also due on the utilization of medicaid managed care organizations 
drug manufacturers medicaid rebate agreements  which are between each manufacturer and the secretary of health and human services  provide that the drug manufacturer will remit rebates to each state medicaid agency on a quarterly basis 
those rebates are based on pricing data reported by manufacturers to cms on both a monthly and a quarterly basis  including average manufacturer price amp and best price 
recently enacted health reform legislation changed the definition of amp effective the fourth quarter of calendar pursuant to the same legislation  effective for rebate periods beginning with the first quarter of calendar  the rebate formulas used to determine the rebate amounts due are as follows for noninnovator products  in general generic drugs marketed under andas  the rebate amount is of the amp for the quarter  for innovator products  in general brand name products marketed under ndas  the rebate amount is the greater of of the amp for the quarter or the difference between such amp and the best price for that same quarter 
the company has a medicaid rebate agreement in effect with the federal government 
federal and or state governments have and are expected to continue to enact measures aimed at reducing the cost of drugs to such governmental payers as well as the public  including the enactment in december of medicare legislation that expanded the scope of medicare coverage to include outpatient drugs part d  starting in january  as well as recently enacted health reform legislation 
management cannot predict the nature of such measures or their impact on the company s profitability 
various states have in recent years also adopted supplemental drug rebate programs that are intended to provide the individual states with additional manufacturer rebates on medicaid utilization over and above those required under a manufacturer s federal medicaid agreement 
states also have created drug coverage and corresponding manufacturer rebate programs for non medicaid populations  known as state pharmaceutical assistance programs 
these rebate programs are generally designed to mimic the federal drug rebate program in terms of how the manufacturer rebates are calculated 
although there are a number of supplemental and state pharmacy assistance rebate programs  for the company they are insignificant in the aggregate compared to quarterly medicaid drug rebate obligations 
cms rules require pharmaceutical companies to calculate and report the amp to cms 
cms uses this calculation to help determine reimbursements to pharmacies that dispense medicines to medicaid beneficiaries 
prior to the enactment of this legal requirement in july  cms typically used the average wholesaler price awp or wholesaler acquisition cost wac in the calculation of federal upper limits 
the final rule also rejected requests to postpone the public availability of amp data 
in mid december  a preliminary injunction was granted  resulting in postponement of the actual implementation of the rule 
on december   by agreement of the parties  the injunction was dissolved and the case was dismissed 
further  the patient protection and affordable care act  pub 
l 
no 
 stat 
  amended the statutory definitions of the terms average manufacturer price and multiple source drug in a manner that materially affects the regulatory definitions of those terms  and changed the manner in which defendants calculate federal upper limits fuls 
on november   cms issued a final rule that withdrew the regulations defining average manufacturer price and multiple source drug and the regulation pursuant to which it would have established fuls for multiple source drugs 
that final rule became effective december  the company does not know how the new methodology for calculating fuls  will affect the company pharmacy customers or to what extent these customers will seek to pass on any decrease in medicaid reimbursements to the company 
the company cannot predict how the sharing of weighted average monthly amp data and retail survey prices may impact competition in the marketplace 
manufacturers also must participate in the b drug pricing program for federal funds to be available to pay for their drugs under medicaid and medicare part b 
participating manufacturers must agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the b ceiling price for the manufacturer s covered outpatient drugs 
sales made by the company pursuant to the b program are not material to the company as a whole 
additional federal and state regulation the federal health care program anti kickback statute prohibits  among other things  knowingly and willfully offering  paying  soliciting  or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing  ordering  or arranging for the purchase or order of any health care item or service reimbursable under medicare  medicaid  or other federally financed healthcare programs 
this statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers  purchasers  and formulary managers on the other 
although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common manufacturer business arrangements and activities from prosecution  the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly  and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing  purchases  or recommendations of the company s products may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor 
federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting  or causing to be presented  a false claim for payment to the federal government  or knowingly making  or causing to be made  a false statement to get a false claim paid 
recently  several pharmaceutical and other health care companies have been investigated and have reached substantial financial settlements with the federal government under these laws for a variety of activities that have been alleged to have caused the submission of false claims to federal health care programs  including providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product and marketing of products for unapproved  and thus non reimbursable  uses 
the company s activities relating to the sale and marketing of its products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws 
the majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti kickback law and false claims laws  which apply to items and services reimbursed under medicaid and other state programs  or  in several states  that apply regardless of the payor 
sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties  exclusion of a manufacturer s products from reimbursement under government programs  criminal fines  and imprisonment 
consumer product safety commission under the poison prevention packaging act pppa  the cpsc has authority to designate that dietary supplements and certain pharmaceuticals require child resistant packaging to help reduce the incidence of accidental poisonings 
the cpsc has published regulations requiring iron containing dietary supplements and various pharmaceuticals to have child resistant packaging  and has established rules for testing the effectiveness of child resistant packaging and for ensuring senior adult effectiveness 
the consumer product safety improvement act of cpsia amended the consumer product safety act cpsa to require that the manufacturer of any product that is subject to any cpsc rule  ban  standard or regulation certify that based on a reasonable testing program the product complies with cpsc requirements 
this certification applies to pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements that require child resistant packaging under the pppa 
the cpsc lifted the stay of enforcement of the certification requirement and the regulation has been in effect since february  federal trade commission the ftc exercises primary jurisdiction over the advertising and other promotional practices of marketers of dietary supplements and otc pharmaceuticals and often works with the fda regarding these practices 
the ftc considers whether a product s claims are substantiated  truthful and not misleading 
the ftc is also responsible for reviewing mergers between and acquisitions of pharmaceutical companies exceeding specified thresholds and investigating certain business practices relevant to the healthcare industry 
the ftc could challenge these business practices in administrative or judicial proceedings 
for example  in accordance with the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of  agreements between nda and anda holders relating to settlements of patent litigation involving paragraph iv certifications under the hatch waxman act  as well as agreements between generic applicants that have submitted andas containing paragraph iv certifications where the agreement concerns either company s day exclusivity  must be submitted to the ftc and the united states department of justice for review 
state regulation most states regulate foods and drugs under laws that generally parallel federal statutes

in europe and israel  the manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical products are regulated in a manner similar in many respects to nda and andas in the us legal requirements generally prohibit the handling  manufacture  marketing and importation of any pharmaceutical product unless it is properly registered in accordance with applicable law 
the registration file relating to any particular product must contain medical data related to product efficacy and safety  including results of clinical testing and references to medical publications  as well as detailed information regarding production methods and quality control 
health ministries are authorized to cancel the registration of a product if it is found to be harmful or ineffective or manufactured and marketed other than in accordance with registration conditions 
data exclusivity provisions exist in many countries  including in the european union  where these provisions were recently extended  although the application is not uniform 
similar provisions may be adopted by additional countries  including israel  where legislation has been proposed 
in general  these exclusivity provisions prevent the approval and or submission of generic drug applications to the health authorities for a fixed period of time following the first approval of the brand name product in that country 
as these exclusivity provisions operate independently of patent exclusivity  they may prevent the submission of generic drug applications for some products even after the patent protection has expired

risk factors 
the company operates in a highly regulated industry 
an inability to meet current or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position and operating results 
several us and foreign agencies regulate the manufacturing  processing  formulation  packaging  labeling  testing  storing  distribution  advertising and sale of the company s products 
various state and local agencies also regulate these activities 
in addition  the company manufactures and markets certain of its products in accordance with the guidelines established by voluntary standards organizations 
should the company or one of its third party service providers used in the development or commercialization of product fail to adequately conform to these regulations and guidelines  there may be a material adverse impact on the operating results of the company 
in particular  packaging  labeling or marketing changes mandated by the fda or state and local agencies can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations of the company 
required changes could be related to safety or efficacy issues 
similarly  the failure by the company or one of its suppliers to comply with manufacturing  quality and testing guidelines and regulations could have a significant adverse impact on the company s operating results 
there is also the risk that the fda could require the company to audit or repeat prior bioequivalence or clinical studies or the fda could change or withdraw the approval governing such products  which could have a material adverse impact on the results of the company s operations 
the company believes that it generally has a good relationship with the fda  which it intends to maintain 
if these relationships should deteriorate  however  the company s ability to bring new and current products to market could be impeded 
see item business government regulation 
all facilities where rx and otc drugs are manufactured  tested  packaged  stored or distributed must comply with fda cgmps 
all of the company s anda  nda and otc drug products are manufactured  tested  packaged  stored and distributed according to cgmp regulations 
all facilities where dietary supplements are manufactured  tested  packaged  stored or distributed must comply with the gmp regulations for dietary supplements 
the fda performs periodic audits to ensure that the company s facilities remain in compliance with all applicable regulations 
typically  after the fda completes its inspection  it may or may not issue the company a report on form  containing the fda s observations of possible violations of cgmp 
these violations can range from minor to severe in nature 
the degree of severity of the violation is generally determined by the time necessary to remediate the cgmp violation  and any adverse consequences for the consumer of the company s drug products 
if the deficiency observations are determined to be severe  the fda may elect to issue a warning letter to the company 
fda guidelines specify that a warning letter be issued only for violations of regulatory significance for which the failure to adequately and promptly achieve correction may be expected to result in further enforcement action 
in addition to making its concerns public  the fda could impose sanctions including  among others  fines  product recalls  total or partial suspension of production and or distribution  suspension of the fda s review of product applications  injunctions and civil or criminal prosecution 
these enforcement actions  if imposed  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and financial condition 
under certain circumstances  the fda also has the authority to revoke previously granted drug approvals 
although the company has internal compliance programs in place that it believes are adequate  the fda may conclude that these programs do not meet regulatory standards 
if compliance is deemed deficient in any significant way  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
on april   the company received a warning letter dated april  from the fda related to the fda november inspection of the company allegan manufacturing facilities 
the company provided the fda with a written response to the warning letter  which was accepted by the fda 
in addition  the company developed a comprehensive plan to review and augment the quality systems and manufacturing operations at the allegan facilities and implemented the measures outlined in that plan 
on march   the company announced that  as part of the anticipated follow up to the warning letter received on april   the fda had arrived at its allegan facilities for re inspection 
on april   the company announced that the fda had concluded its re inspection of the allegan facilities and had informed the company that  effective immediately  the company had an acceptable regulatory status  such that any pending export license and anda applications from these facilities will once again be eligible for review and approval 
on may   the fda sent a letter to the company closing out the warning letter issued to the company in april  and later posted the closeout date on the fda enforcement website 
on july   the company received the establishment report for the march re inspection from the fda  which officially closed the fda re inspection of the company allegan manufacturing facilities 
the fda s policy regarding the award of a day market exclusivity period to generic manufacturers who successfully challenge patents relating to specific products continues to be the subject of extensive litigation in the us the fda s current interpretation of hatch waxman is to award days of exclusivity to the first generic manufacturer who files a successful paragraph iv certification under hatch waxman challenging the patent s of the branded product  regardless of whether the manufacturer was sued for patent infringement 
although the fda s interpretation may benefit some of the products in the company s pipeline  it may adversely affect others 
the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of provides that the day market exclusivity period provided under hatch waxman is triggered by the commercial marketing of the product 
however  the medicare prescription drug act also contains forfeiture provisions which  if met  will deprive the first paragraph iv filer of exclusivity 
additionally  the manufacturer of the branded product may launch a generic version of its own drug  known as an authorized generic 
under certain circumstances  the company may not be able to fully exploit its day exclusivity period resulting from it being the first filer 
under the food and drug administration amendments act of  the fda has the power to restrict medications that raise serious safety concerns 
this law requires  and provides funding for  the fda to monitor drugs after they go on the market 
in addition  this law requires companies to make public the results of many of their studies 
under this law  the fda has the authority to require new studies  limit distribution or order label changes 
because of this law  the company s ability to bring new and current products to market could be impeded  which could have a negative material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company s prescription drug products that are marketed without approved applications must meet certain manufacturing and labeling standards established by the fda 
the fda s policy with respect to the continued marketing of unapproved products is stated in the fda s june compliance policy guide  titled marketed new drugs without approved ndas or andas 
under this policy  the fda has stated that it will follow a risk based approach with regard to enforcement against such unapproved products 
the fda evaluates whether to initiate enforcement action on a case by case basis  but gives higher priority to enforcement action against products in certain categories  such as those marketed as unapproved drugs with potential safety risks or that lack evidence of effectiveness 
the fda recognizes that certain unapproved products  based on the introduction date of their active ingredients and the lack of safety concerns  among other things  have been marketed for many years and  at this time  might not be subject to immediate enforcement action 
the company believes that so long as it complies with applicable manufacturing and labeling standards  it will be in compliance with the fda s current enforcement policy 
there can be no assurance that the fda will continue this policy or not take a contrary position with any individual product or group of products 
if the fda were to take a contrary position  the company may be required to seek fda approval for these products or withdraw such products from the market 
for fiscal  the company s annual sales for such unapproved products were approximately  in october  the fda convened a joint meeting of the pediatric and nonprescription drugs advisory committees to discuss the safety and efficacy of otc cough and cold products for use in children 
the advisory committees recommended that these products no longer be used in children under the age of six 
on october   the fda issued a statement supporting the voluntary action of the consumer healthcare product association chpa  of which the company is a member  to modify product labels for consumers of otc cough and cold medicines to state do not use in children under four years of age 
the company completed the chpa recommended revisions to all otc cough and cold products in april the fda has not issued any further guidance about the labeling of otc cough and cold medicines in children two years of age and older 
sales of the company s pediatric cough and cold products could be adversely affected by recommendations resulting from this review 
the company s activities with respect to its infant formula products also may be subject to barriers or sanctions imposed by countries or international organizations limiting international trade and dictating the specific content of infant formula products 
in addition  regulatory changes or decisions that restrict the manufacture  labeling and availability of the company s infant formula products could affect the company s results of operations 
for example  certain governmental agencies  non governmental organizations and consumer advocates have lobbied against the marketing and sale of some infant formula products 
these efforts could result in increased regulatory restrictions or enforcement 
a melamine incident in china has resulted in increased global scrutiny of the infant formula industry  which may result in increased costs and may reduce the company s margins and profitability 
the us government will likely continue to enhance its regulations on the industry aimed to ensure the safety and quality of dairy products  including  but not limited to  compulsory batch by batch inspection and testing for additional safety and quality issues 
such inspections and testing may increase the company s operating costs related to its infant formula products 
the company manufactures products that are safe and effective when used in accordance with label directions  however  certain products contain ingredients that can be used for improper purposes 
additional legislation or regulation may be enacted to mitigate improper uses of these ingredients  which could have an adverse impact on the company s sales of such products and resulting income 
acetaminophen the company manufactures several products that contain the active ingredient acetaminophen  which is indicated as an analgesic 
in june  the fda held a public advisory committee meeting to discuss how to address the potential for liver injury related to the risk of overdose of acetaminophen in both otc and rx products 
the fda expressly stated that the risk of developing liver injury to the individual patient who uses the drug according to directions is extremely low and that it is not seeking to remove acetaminophen from the market 
however  due to the extensive use of acetaminophen containing products  the fda sought guidance from several advisory committees regarding measures to reduce the potential for liver injury associated with acetaminophen use 
measures discussed include  but were not limited to  reducing the maximum single dose and daily dose  reducing packaging sizes  and increasing consumer educational efforts regarding such products 
at a may meeting of the fda nonprescription drugs advisory committee and pediatric advisory committee to review efforts to reduce medication errors around the use of single ingredient pediatric acetaminophen  the fda joint committees unanimously voted in support of the addition to the label of weight based dosing for children ages two to twelve  that the pharmacokinetic pk  safety and efficacy data would be required to support the addition of new label directions for children six months to two years of age  and that the new labeling for children six months to two years of age include the indication for fever reduction 
the committees did not support an indication in labeling for children six months to two years of age for relief of pain  this indication is currently included for children over two years of age 
the fda is reviewing the input it received from the advisory committees and additional comments submitted through the docket 
in fiscal  products containing acetaminophen generated revenues of approximately  for the company 
the company cannot predict whether the fda will adopt any recommendations of the advisory committees regarding the sale and use of acetaminophen or whether any such recommendations  if adopted by the fda  would impact future revenues attributable to these products 
pseudoephedrine the company produces a number of products that contain the active ingredient pseudoephedrine pse  which is indicated as a nasal decongestant 
pse has been under scrutiny as an ingredient illegally used to produce methamphetamine 
to address this concern  legislation has been enacted at the federal level restricting the sales of pse products ie  combat methamphetamine epidemic act and authorizing the dea to place quotas on the amounts of pse raw material that can be procured ie  the controlled substances act 
at the state level  a number of states have introduced or passed legislation placing additional restrictions on the sale of pse products 
in addition  the states of oregon and mississippi have moved pse products to rx status  many localities have passed similar legislation and a few other states have considered moving pse products to rx status 
sales of pse products by the company in fiscal were approximately  sales of pse products could be adversely affected by action at the state or federal level to place additional restrictions on the sale of pse products 
phenylephrine the nonprescription drug advisory committee met in december to discuss the efficacy of phenylephrine  an active ingredient used in various cough and cold products as a nasal decongestant 
the advisory committee vote recommended that available data is supportive of the efficacy of phenylephrine at milligrams 
in addition  the advisory committee recommended additional evidence to support the efficacy of a milligram dose of phenylephrine 
the recommendations by the advisory committee are not binding on the fda 
it is not known at this time what  if any  further action the fda or industry will take in response to recommendations of the advisory committee 
in fiscal  products containing phenylephrine generated revenues of approximately  certain actions by the fda  such as mandating label and packaging changes  could have an adverse effect on the operating results of the company 
dextromethorphan the company manufactures several products that contain the active ingredient dextromethorphan  which is indicated for cough suppression 
dextromethorphan has come under scrutiny because of its potential to be abused 
some states have introduced legislation that  if passed  could require restricted access to dextromethorphan in finished dosage forms 
such legislation placing age restrictions on the purchase of otc products containing dextromethorphan was passed at the local level by suffolk county  new york  westchester county  new york and by the city of jerseyville  illinois 
at least one state has passed legislation restricting the bulk sale of dextromethorphan 
legislation has been unsuccessfully introduced at the federal level over the past few sessions of congress that would have  if enacted  generally prohibited the bulk sale of dextromethorphan and also imposed a federal age limit of years old in order to purchase finished products containing dextromethorphan 
it is possible that any of the states or the federal government could introduce and pass legislation imposing additional or different restrictions on the sale of dextromethorphan in finished dosage form  such as requiring a minimum age to purchase product 
in fiscal  products containing dextromethorphan generated revenues of approximately  the company cannot predict whether any of the proposed legislation will be passed or  if it is passed  its impact on future revenues attributable to these products 
the fda held a meeting of the drug safety and risk management advisory committee on september  to discuss the potential abuse of the drug dextromethorphan and the public health benefits and risks of dextromethorphan use as a cough suppressant in prescription and nonprescription drug products 
in a vote  an fda advisory panel voted not to restrict dextromethorphan cough medications to prescription only 
it is possible that the fda could still recommend in the future that dextromethorphan containing products be considered a scheduled substance  which would remove their status as an otc product 
the company cannot predict the likelihood of such activity by the fda and any adverse impact such activity it may have on the company s results of operations 
the company s products are safe and effective when used in accordance with label directions 
however  certain products contain ingredients that can be  and in some cases are  used for improper purposes 
as previously discussed  pseudoephedrine and dextromethorphan are two of these ingredients  but others may exist 
increasingly  various efforts are employed by federal and state governments in an effort to curb this misuse  including the consideration of additional legislation or regulation that may result in further restrictive requirements for the manufacture or sale of products containing these ingredients 
the company cannot predict if or when any additional legislation or regulation will be passed and any adverse impact it may have on the company s results of operations 
unfavorable publicity or consumer perception of the company s products and any similar products distributed by other companies could have a material adverse impact on the company s business 
the company is dependent upon consumers perception of the safety and quality of its products 
negative consumer perception may arise from media reports  product liability claims  regulatory investigations or recalls  regardless of whether such media reports  claims  investigations or recalls involve the company or its products 
the mere publication of information asserting defects in products or ingredients could have a material adverse effect on the company  regardless of whether such information is scientifically supported or concerns the company s products or the raw materials used in the company s products 
for example  any major outbreak of any illness or disease in cows could lead to a serious loss of consumer confidence in  and demand for  dairy products  including the company s infant formula products 
adverse publicity about these types of concerns  whether valid or not  may negatively impact consumer perceptions and discourage consumers from buying one or more of the company s products  such that the company s sales may decline and the company may suffer losses in its business 
the company may incur liabilities or experience negative reputational effects as a result of any real or perceived quality issues with the company s products 
the company s products involve risks such as product contamination  spoilage  mislabeling and tampering that could require the company to recall one or more of its products 
serious product quality concerns could also result in governmental actions against the company that  among other things  could result in the suspension of production or distribution of the company s products  product seizures  loss of certain licenses  delays in the issuance of governmental approvals for new products or other governmental penalties 
adverse publicity or negative public perception regarding the quality of the company s products  particular ingredients  or the industries in which the company competes could result in a substantial decrease in demand for the company s products 
the company cannot guarantee that counterfeiting  imitation  or other tampering with its products will not occur or that the company will be able to detect and resolve it if it happens 
any occurrence of counterfeiting or contamination could negatively impact sales of the company s products  particularly if counterfeit or imitation products cause death or injury to consumers of those products 
additionally  powdered infant formula products are not sterile 
a substantial portion of the company s infant formula products must be prepared and maintained according to label instruction to retain their flavor and nutritional value and avoid contamination or deterioration 
depending on the product  a risk of contamination or deterioration may exist at each stage of the production cycle  including the purchase and delivery of raw materials  the processing and packaging of food products  and the use and handling by consumers  hospital personnel and health care professionals 
in the event that certain of the company s infant formula products are found or alleged to have suffered contamination or deterioration  whether or not such products are under the company s control  the company s reputation and its infant formula product category could be materially adversely affected 
the company s infant formula product category is subject to changing consumer preferences and health and nutritional related concerns 
the company s results of operations depend  in part  on consumer preferences and choices  including the number of mothers who choose to use infant formula products rather than breastfeed their babies 
to the extent that private  public and government sources may promote the benefits of breastfeeding over the use of infant formula  there could be a reduced demand for infant formula products  and the company s infant formula products business could be adversely affected 
the company s infant formula product category may also be affected by medical research relating to the healthfulness of cow s milk in the human diet 
for example  adverse research may raise concerns about the fat  cholesterol  calorie  sodium and lactose content or contamination of dairy products  including infant formula 
any significant shift in consumer preference away from the use of infant formula may materially and adversely affect the results of operations of the company s infant formula product category 
additionally  the company s infant formula product category could be adversely impacted by an increase in the number of families that are provided with infant formula by the federal government through the wic program  as the company does not participate in this program 
the company believes that growth in the nutritional products business is based largely on national media attention regarding scientific research suggesting potential health benefits from regular consumption of certain vitamin and other nutritional products 
there can be no assurance of future favorable scientific results and media attention  or the absence of unfavorable or inconsistent findings 
in the event of future unfavorable scientific results or media attention  the company s sales of nutritional products could be materially adversely impacted 
federal and state health care reform may have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
increasing expenditures for health care have been the subject of considerable public attention in north america  israel and many european countries 
both private and governmental entities are seeking ways to reduce or contain health care costs 
in many countries where the company currently operates  pharmaceutical prices are subject to regulation 
in the us  numerous proposals that would effect changes in the us health care system and the pharmaceutical industry have been introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures that could include  but not be limited to  intellectual property  regulatory  antitrust  drug pricing and product liability issues 
similar activities are taking place throughout europe 
as a result of governmental budgetary constraints  the israel ministry of health and the major israeli health funds have sought to further reduce healthcare costs by  among other things  applying continuous pressure to reduce pharmaceutical prices and inventory levels 
the company cannot predict the nature of the measures that may be adopted  how they will be interpreted by the courts or the administrative agencies charged with enforcing them or their impact on the marketing  pricing and demand for its products 
federal law requires that a pharmaceutical manufacturer  as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the states for the manufacturer s drugs under medicaid and medicare part b  must enter into a rebate agreement to pay rebates to state medicaid programs for the manufacturer s covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state medicaid program under a fee for service arrangement 
the cms is responsible for administering the medicaid rebate agreements between the federal government and pharmaceutical manufacturers 
rebates are also due on the utilization of medicaid managed care organizations 
the company has a medicaid rebate agreement in effect with the federal government 
federal and or state governments have enacted and are expected to continue to enact measures aimed at reducing the cost of drugs to such governmental payers as well as the public  including the enactment in december of medicare legislation that expanded the scope of medicare coverage to include outpatient drugs part d  starting in january  as well as health reform legislation enacted in management cannot predict the nature of such measures or their impact on the company s profitability 
various states have in recent years also adopted supplemental drug rebate programs that are intended to provide the individual states with additional manufacturer rebates on medicaid utilization over and above those required under a manufacturer s federal medicaid agreement 
states also have created drug coverage and corresponding manufacturer rebate programs for non medicaid populations  known as state pharmaceutical assistance programs 
these rebate programs are generally designed to mimic the federal drug rebate program in terms of how the manufacturer rebates are calculated 
although there are a number of supplemental and state pharmacy assistance rebate programs  for the company they are insignificant in the aggregate compared to quarterly medicaid drug rebate obligations 
cms rules require pharmaceutical companies to calculate and report the amp to cms 
cms uses this calculation to help determine reimbursements to pharmacies that dispense medicines to medicaid beneficiaries 
prior to the enactment of this legal requirement in july  cms typically used the awp or wac in the calculation of federal upper limits 
the final rule also rejected requests to postpone the public availability of amp data 
in mid december  a preliminary injunction was granted  resulting in postponement of the actual implementation of the rule 
on december   by agreement of the parties  the injunction was dissolved and the case was dismissed 
further  the patient protection and affordable care act  pub 
l 
no 
 stat 
  amended the statutory definitions of the terms average manufacturer price and multiple source drug in a manner that materially affects the regulatory definitions of those terms  and changed the manner in which defendants calculate fuls 
on november   cms issued a final rule that withdrew the regulations defining average manufacturer price and multiple source drug and the regulation pursuant to which it would have established fuls for multiple source drugs 
that final rule became effective december  the company does not know how the new methodology for calculating fuls  will affect the company pharmacy customers or to what extent these customers will seek to pass on any decrease in medicaid reimbursements to the company 
the company cannot predict how the sharing of weighted average monthly amp data and retail survey prices may impact competition in the marketplace 
on november   the house of representatives passed the affordable health care for america act hr  originally introduced on july   by rep 
dingell as america s affordable health choices act hr 
this legislation eliminates the ability of american families to use funds from flexible spending accounts fsas to purchase otc medicines 
the company cannot predict how the elimination of allowing families to use fsas to purchase otc medicines will affect the market for otc products 
if the company is unable to maintain adequately high levels of customer service over time  it may lose market share  and its business and operating results may be materially adversely affected 
the company understands that maintaining high levels of customer service requires the company to be able to deliver high quality products to its customers on a timely basis 
from time to time  the company may experience interruptions and challenges to its customer service levels due to a variety of factors that may arise 
recently  as some of the company competitors have experienced production problems or have suspended production altogether  the company has experienced significant increases in the volume of customer orders in certain product categories 
additionally  recent enhancements to the company quality assurance systems constrained the pace of some of the company production output for a limited period of time 
if the company is unable to maintain adequately high levels of customer service over time  due to these factors or otherwise  the company may lose market share  and its business and operating results may be materially adversely affected 
if the company cannot continue to rapidly develop  manufacture and market innovative products that meet customer requirements for performance  safety and cost effectiveness  it may lose market share and its revenues may suffer 
the company s future results of operations depend  to a significant degree  upon its ability to successfully commercialize additional otc and generic prescription drugs and or innovative pharmaceuticals  infant formulas and api 
all pharmaceutical products must meet regulatory standards and or receive regulatory approvals 
the company must prove that the otc anda and generic prescription products are bioequivalent to their branded counterparts  which typically requires bioequivalency studies or even more extensive clinical trials in the case of topical products 
the development and commercialization process  particularly with respect to innovative products  is both time consuming and costly and involves a high degree of business risk 
products currently under development  if and when fully developed and tested  may not perform as expected  may not pass required bioequivalence studies  may be the subject of intellectual property challenges  necessary regulatory approvals may not be obtained in a timely manner  if at all  and the company may not be able to successfully and profitably produce and market such products 
delays in any part of the process or the company s inability to obtain regulatory approval of its products including products developed by others to which the company has exclusive marketing rights could adversely affect operating results by restricting or delaying its introduction of new products 
even upon the successful development of a product  the company s customer s failure to launch a product could adversely affect operating results 
the fda could impose higher standards and additional requirements  such as requiring more supporting data and clinical data than previously required  in order to gain fda clearance to launch new formulations in to the market 
continuous introductions of new products and product categories are critical to the company s business 
product margins may decline over time due to the products aging life cycles  changes in consumer choice or developments in drug delivery technology 
therefore  new product introductions are necessary for maintenance of the company s current financial condition  and if the company fails to introduce and market new products  the effect on its financial results could be materially adverse 
the company s investment in research and development is expected to increase above recent levels in dollar terms but remain relatively flat as a percentage of sales due to the company s ongoing broadening of its otc anda  generic prescription and specialty api product portfolio  as well as several opportunities for new products that are switching from rx to otc status 
the ability to attract scientists proficient in emerging delivery forms and or contracting with a third party in order to generate new products of this type is a critical element of the company s long term plans 
should the company fail to attract qualified employees  successfully develop products in a timely manner  or enter into reasonable agreements with third parties  long term sales growth and profit would be adversely impacted 
the price of shares of company common stock is volatile and  therefore  investors cannot rely on historical trends to predict future stock prices 
the market price of the company s common stock has been  and could be  subject to wide fluctuations in response to  among other things  quarterly fluctuations in operating results  adverse circumstances affecting the introduction or market acceptance of new products  product recalls  failure to meet published estimates of or changes in earnings estimates and stock ratings by securities analysts  announcements of new products or enhancements by competitors  receipt of regulatory approvals by competitors  sales of common stock by existing holders  loss of key personnel  market conditions in the industry  shortages of key product inventory components and general economic conditions 
the company s quarterly results are impacted by a number of factors  some of which are beyond the control of management  that may result in significant quarter to quarter fluctuations in operating results 
the company s quarterly operating results depend on a variety of factors including  but not limited to  the severity  length and timing of the cough cold flu season  the timing of new product approvals and introductions by the company and its competitors  price competition  changes in the regulatory environment  the magnitude and timing of research and development investments  changes in the levels of inventories maintained by the company s customers and the timing of retailer promotional programs 
accordingly  the company may be subject to significant and unanticipated quarter to quarter fluctuations in its operating results 
the competitive markets the company operates in could lead to reduced demand for its products in favor of its competitors products  which could negatively impact its sales  gross margin  and prospects 
the markets for otc pharmaceutical  nutritional  infant formula  generic pharmaceutical and api products are highly competitive 
competition is based primarily on price  quality and assortment of products  customer service  marketing support and availability of new products 
competition also comes from national brand companies and branded pharmaceutical companies 
that competition could be intensified should those companies lower prices or manufacture their own store brand or generic equivalent products 
due to the high degree of price competition  the company has not always been able to fully pass on cost increases to its customers 
the inability to pass on future cost increases  the impact of store brand competitors and the impact of national brand companies lowering prices of their products or operating in the store brand market could have a material adverse impact on financial results 
in addition  since the company sells its nutritional products through retail drug  supermarket and mass merchandise chains  it may experience increased competition in its nutritional products business through alternative channels such as health food stores  direct mail and direct sales as more consumers obtain products through these channels 
the company has evaluated  and will continue to evaluate  the products and product categories in which it does business 
future product line extensions  or deletions  could have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
selling prices of generic drugs typically decline  sometimes dramatically  as competition intensifies due to additional companies receiving approvals for a given product or brands launching authorized generics 
to the extent that the company succeeds in being the first to market a generic version of a significant product  the company s sales and profit can be substantially increased in the period following the introduction of such product and prior to a competitor s introduction of an equivalent product 
the company s ability to sustain its sales and profitability on any product over time is dependent on both the number of new competitors for such product  some of whom may be significantly larger than the company  and the timing of their approvals 
certain competitors are choosing to consolidate in the generic pharmaceutical and nutritional industries 
these consolidations may create larger companies with which the company must compete and provide further pressure on prices  development activities or customer retention 
the impact of future consolidation in the industry could have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company s api business is subject to increased competition from other manufacturers of api located in europe and developing countries  such as india and china 
such competition may result in loss of api customers and or decreased profitability in this business segment 
the company s success is dependent  in large part  on continued store brand growth  which is influenced by factors outside management s control 
there can be no assurance that store brand products will continue to grow and failure to achieve continued growth may adversely impact the company s sales and resulting financial condition 
the future growth of domestic store brand products will be influenced  in part  by general economic conditions  which can influence consumers to switch to and from store brand products  consumer perception and acceptance of the quality of the products available  the development of new products and or product delivery forms  the market exclusivity periods awarded on rx to otc switch products and the ongoing or growing strength of the retailers brands in the market 
the company does not advertise like the national brand companies and thus is largely dependent on retailer promotional activities to drive sales volume and increase market share 
growth opportunities for the products in which the company currently has a significant store brand market share cough cold flu allergy  analgesic  smoking cessation and gastrointestinal products will be driven by the ability to offer new products to existing domestic customers 
branded pharmaceutical companies may use state and federal regulatory and legislative means to limit the availability of brand equivalent products 
should store brand growth be limited by any of these factors  there could be a significant adverse impact on the operating results of the company 
lack of availability of  or significant increases in the cost of  raw materials used in manufacturing the company s products could adversely impact its profit margins and operating results 
affordable high quality raw materials and packaging components are essential to all of the company s business units due to the nature of the products the company manufactures 
raw materials and packaging components are generally available from multiple suppliers 
supplies of certain raw materials  bulk tablets and finished goods purchased by the company are limited  or are available from one or only a few suppliers 
in these situations  increased prices  rationing and shortages can occur 
in response to these problems the company tries to identify alternative materials or suppliers for such raw materials  bulk tablets and finished goods 
fda requirements for products approved through the anda or nda process could substantially lengthen the approval of an alternate material source 
certain material shortages and approval of alternate sources could adversely affect financial results 
the rapid increase in cost of many raw materials from inflationary forces  such as increased energy costs  and the company s ability or inability to pass on these increases to its customers  could have a material impact on the company s financial results 
the company maintains several single source supplier relationships  either because alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to regulatory  performance  quality  support  or price considerations 
unavailability or delivery delays of single source components or products could adversely affect the company s ability to ship the related product in a timely manner 
the effect of unavailability or delivery delays would be more severe if associated with the company s higher volume and more profitable products 
even where alternative sources of supply are available  qualifying the alternate suppliers and establishing reliable supplies could cost more or could result in delays and a loss of revenues 
as a result  the loss of a single source supplier could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
in addition  raw materials purchased from third parties  including those from foreign countries  may contain counterfeit ingredients or other adulterants 
the company maintains a strict program of verification and product testing throughout the ingredient sourcing and manufacturing process to identify potential counterfeit ingredients  adulterants and toxic substances 
nevertheless  discovery of previously unknown problems with the raw materials or product manufacturing processes or new data suggesting an unacceptable safety risk associated therewith  could result in a voluntary or mandatory withdrawal of the contaminated product from the marketplace  either temporarily or permanently 
any future recall or removal would result in additional costs to the company  and may give rise to product liability litigation  either of which could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of the company 
the company s infant formula products require certain key raw ingredients that are derived from raw milk  such as skim milk powder  whey protein powder and lactose 
the company s supply of raw milk may be limited by the ability of individual dairy farmers and cooperatives to provide raw milk in the amount and quality to meet the needs of the company s infant formula product category 
raw milk production is influenced by factors beyond the company s control  including seasonal factors  such as dairy cows producing more milk in temperate weather than hot or cold weather  and extended unseasonably hot or cold weather potentially leading to lower than expected supplies  environmental factors  such as the volume and quality of milk produced by dairy cows being linked closely to the quality of nourishment provided by the surrounding environment  and governmental agricultural and environmental policy  such as government grants  subsidies  land provisions  technical assistance  and other agricultural and environmental policies having a direct effect on the viability of individual dairy farmers and dairy farmer cooperatives and the number of dairy cows and quantities of milk they are able to produce 
the company cannot guarantee that there will be sufficient supplies of these key ingredients derived from raw milk 
any disruption in the supply of these key ingredients derived from raw milk could adversely and materially impact the company s infant formula product category 
the company s products  and the raw materials used to make those products  generally have limited shelf lives 
the company s inventory levels are based  in part  on expectations regarding future sales 
the company may experience build ups in inventory if sales slow 
any significant shortfall in sales may result in higher inventory levels of raw materials and finished products  thereby increasing the risk of inventory spoilage and corresponding inventory write downs and write offs  which may materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations 
additionally  the fda is beginning to scrutinize claims on infant formula labels 
labeling changes required for regulatory compliance could render packaging inventories obsolete 
cargo thefts and or diversions and economically or maliciously motivated product tampering in store shelves may be experienced from time to time  causing unexpected shortages 
the costs  both financially and in regard to management attention  of combating legal proceedings could have an adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time  the company and or its subsidiaries become involved in lawsuits arising from various commercial matters  including  but not limited to  competitive issues  contract issues  intellectual property matters  workers compensation  product liability  environmental remediation issues and state or federal regulatory issues 
see item legal proceedings 
litigation is unpredictable and can be costly 
no assurance can be made that litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations in the future 
similarly  judicial decisions in proceedings to which the company is not a party may result in the setting of legal precedent that could affect the future operation of the company s business 
in addition  the company may face environmental exposures including  for example  those relating to discharges from and materials handled as part of its operations  the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated hazardous substances or wastes  and the health and safety of its employees 
while the company does not have any material remediation liabilities currently outstanding  the company may in the future face liability for the costs of investigation  removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances or petroleum products on  under  or in its currently or formerly owned property  or from a third party disposal facility that it may have used  without regard to whether the company knew of  or caused  the presence of the contaminants 
the actual or alleged presence of  or failure to remediate properly  these substances could have adverse effects  including  for example  substantial investigative or remedial obligations and limitations on the ability to sell or rent affected property or to borrow funds using affected property as collateral 
there can be no assurance that environmental liabilities and costs will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the company may also be subject to liability if its products violate or are alleged to violate applicable laws or regulations in the jurisdictions where such products are distributed or in the event that its products cause or are alleged to cause injury  illness  or death 
the successful assertion of product liability claims against the company could result in potentially significant monetary damages and diversion of management resources  and require the company to make significant payments and incur substantial legal expenses 
even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful  not merited  or not fully pursued  the company may still incur substantial legal expenses defending against such a claim  and the company s reputation may suffer 
recent court rulings limiting the application of federal preemption may have an adverse effect on the company operations as a result of a potential increase in litigation exposure 
on january   the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit issued a decision in gaeta v 
perrigo  reversing a lower court decision that the plaintiff state law causes of action were preempted by the ffdca to the extent that they were based on an alleged lack of adequate warning 
in its decision  the ninth circuit stated that it joined the fifth and eighth circuits in concluding that the us supreme court decision in wyeth v 
levine  s 
ct concluding that the federal regulatory regime governing pharmaceuticals does not preempt state law failure to warn claims against brand name manufacturers extends with equal force to claims against generic manufacturers 
on june   the company filed a writ of certioriari with the united states supreme court seeking an appeal of the ninth circuit ruling in the gaeta case 
the us supreme court recently addressed the issue of whether state law failure to warn claims against generic prescription drug manufacturers for failing to modify their labeling to include warnings that differ from the name brand equivalent are automatically preempted by the fdca requirement that the label for a generic drug be the same as the label for the brand name counterpart in the following three cases from the fifth and eighth circuits pliva v 
mensing   actavis v 
mensing   and actavis v 
demahy  collectively  referred to as pliva v 
mensing 
these cases were consolidated for review 
on june   in a reversal of the decisions of the fifth and eighth circuits  the us supreme court issued its decision in pliva v 
mensing and ruled that state law tort claims against generic manufacturers were preempted because the federal statutes and federal regulations required the same warning label as that approved by the fda for the brand name drug 
with the reversal of the decisions of the fifth and eighth circuits  the company and other manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products otc and rx retain their ability to dismiss certain failure to warn claims based on federal preemption 
at this time  since the writ for certiorari in the gaeta case is still pending  the company cannot predict the impact of that case on its results of operations 
changes in tax laws or income tax rates could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and the ability to utilize cash in tax efficient manner 
income tax rate changes by governments and changes in the tax jurisdictions in which the company operates could influence the effective tax rates for future years 
entry into new tax jurisdictions  whether domestic or international  increases the likelihood of fluctuation 
the mix of income between tax jurisdictions in any given quarter can also significantly change the effective tax rate across quarters and years 
also  changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to utilize cash in a tax efficient manner 
because the company depends upon walmart for a significant portion of its sales  the company s sales and income would be adversely affected by an disruption of its relationship with walmart or any material adverse change in walmart s business 
sales to the company s largest customer  walmart  comprised approximately of fiscal net sales 
should walmart s current relationship with the company change adversely  the resulting loss of business could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
in addition  while no other customer individually comprises more than of total net sales  the company does have other significant customers 
if the company s relationship with one or more of these other customers changes significantly  it could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
changes in supply relationships with the company s customers  such as alternate sources for products  withholding new product introductions and or development of customer store brand programs  could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
maintaining the supply relationships with the company s customers is critical to its success 
if the company is unable to deliver to expected customer service levels  customers may choose to assess penalties  obtain alternate sources for products  withhold new product introductions and or end the relationship with the company 
the success in recent years of private label marketing programs has increased large retailers attention to the importance of their store brand programs and as a result  many are dedicating significant resources to auditing supplier compliance with their quality  ethical and service standards 
customers may limit the level of product sourcing with the company in protection of the customer s own interests 
any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
retailer consolidation can increase the company s credit risk  which may adversely affect the company s financial position or results of operations 
retailer consolidation continues to inherently increase the size of the company s customers 
if a large customer should encounter financial difficulties  the company s exposure with respect to uncollectible receivables and unusable inventory  as well as the potential loss of future sales  could result in a material adverse impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
conditions in israel affect the company s operations and may limit its ability to produce and sell its products 
the company has significant manufacturing and research and development facilities in israel 
political  economic and military conditions in israel directly affect the company s operations  and the company could be adversely affected by current or future hostilities involving israel or a significant recession or downturn in the economic or financial condition of israel 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its neighboring countries 
a state of hostility  varying in degree and intensity  has led to security and economic problems for israel in recent years 
these hostilities can adversely affect israel s relationship with a number of countries in the region and elsewhere  as well as its relationship with international organizations 
while none of the company s facilities in israel have been directly affected by hostile operations  there can be no assurance that a further escalation of hostilities will not impact the company s facilities 
furthermore  the company s employees in israel include members of the israeli military reserves  some of whom have been called up for active duty 
if a significant number of the company s employees in israel are called up for active duty in the military  the company s operations in israel may be materially adversely affected 
escalations of hostilities have disruptive effects on israel s economy  and any international economic sanctions against israel could further harm israel s economy 
these economic developments could have an adverse effect on the company s israel pharmaceutical and diagnostic products business 
furthermore  certain parties with whom the company does business may decline to travel to israel  which would force the company to make alternative arrangements where necessary 
the united states department of state has at times issued an advisory regarding travel to various sections of israel 
as a result of the state department s advisories  the fda has at various times curtailed or prohibited its inspectors from traveling to israel to inspect the facilities of israeli companies  and should this occur with respect to the company s israeli facilities  the fda could withhold approval for new products intended to be produced at those facilities 
although it has not yet occurred  the political and security situation in israel may result in certain parties with whom the company has contracts claiming that they are not obligated to perform their commitments pursuant to force majeure provisions of those contracts 
the company could experience disruption of its manufacturing and research and development facilities due to terrorist acts or military actions 
if terrorist acts or military actions were to result in substantial damage to the company s facilities  business activities would be disrupted since  with respect to most products  the company would need to obtain prior fda approval for a change in manufacturing site 
the company s insurance may not adequately compensate it for losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by the company could have a material adverse effect on its business 
some neighboring countries  as well as certain companies and organizations  continue to participate in a boycott of israeli firms and others doing business with israel or with israeli companies 
the company is also precluded from marketing its products to certain of these countries due to us and israeli regulatory restrictions 
because an immaterial amount of the company s revenue is currently derived from sales to these countries  the company believes that the boycott has not had a material adverse effect on its current operations 
however  continuation or extension of the boycott or implementation of additional restrictive laws  policies or practices directed towards israel or israeli businesses could have an adverse impact on the expansion of the company s business 
the current economic conditions may adversely impact the company s liquidity and financial condition 
the economies of the united states and the other countries in which the company produces and markets its products continue to be affected by the economic conditions that began with the financial and credit liquidity crisis in late although economic conditions began to improve during fiscal  there continues to be significant uncertainty as to whether this improvement is sustainable 
furthermore  energy costs  geopolitical issues  sovereign debt issues  and the depressed state of global real estate markets have contributed to increased market volatility 
continued market volatility could adversely affect the company s stock price  liquidity and overall financial condition 
the company s customers and suppliers may be adversely affected by a worsening of the current economic conditions 
although the company actively reviews the credit worthiness of its customers and suppliers  the company cannot fully predict to what extent its customers and suppliers may be negatively impacted and thus to what extent the company s operations would be affected 
the company invests cash and cash equivalents primarily in demand deposits and other short term instruments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase 
since the advent of the global financial crisis in the first calendar quarter of  the company has maintained a balance between objectives of safety of principal  liquidity and return by investing primarily in us  federal  state and local government obligations  direct obligations of local sovereign governments and in bank obligations of the company s credit banks meeting a minimum third party credit rating standard 
the value of the company s assets  including securities held for investment  may be adversely affected by a worsening of the current economic conditions 
although the company s lenders have made commitments to make funds available to the company in a timely fashion  if the current economic conditions worsen or new information becomes publicly available impacting these lenders credit ratings or capital ratios  the company s lenders may be unable or unwilling to lend money pursuant to the company s existing credit facilities 
in addition  if the company determines that it is appropriate or necessary to raise capital in the future  the cost of raising funds through the debt or equity markets may be more expensive or those markets may be unavailable 
if the company is unable to use its existing credit facilities or raise funds through debt or equity markets  the company s liquidity or ability to follow its key growth strategies could be materially and adversely affected 
additionally  decreases in personal incomes may have caused consumers to look for and purchase lower priced products  such as generic store brand products manufactured by the company  as an alternative to higher priced brand name products 
to the extent that this trend has occurred  the company s sales could be negatively affected if economic conditions improve and if consumers were enticed to go back to purchasing higher priced brand name products 
although the company only enters into business acquisitions and divestitures that it expects will result in benefits to the company  the company may not realize those benefits because of integration and other challenges 
as part of the company s strategy  it evaluates potential acquisitions in the ordinary course of business  some of which could be and have been material 
acquisitions involve a number of risks and present financial  managerial and operational challenges 
integration activities may place substantial demands on the company s management  operational resources and financial and internal control systems 
customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business  technology  service or product could also have a material adverse effect on the company s reputation and business 
the company s failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could have a negative effect on its operations 
in addition  the lack of performance of acquisitions could cause financial difficulties 
the company expects to achieve certain cost savings and synergies from the paddock acquisition  which was completed subsequent to the company fiscal year end on july   when the two companies have fully integrated their portfolios 
the realization of certain benefits anticipated as a result of the paddock acquisition  however  will depend in part on the successful integration of paddock business portfolio with the company business portfolio 
there can be no assurance that paddock business can be operated profitably or integrated successfully into the company operations in a timely fashion  or at all 
the dedication of management resources to such integration may detract attention from the company day to day business  and there can be no assurance that there will not be substantial costs associated with the transition process or other material adverse effects as a result of these integration efforts 
the company also evaluates the performance of all operating business units against a return on invested capital roic threshold 
underperforming assets typically have a specific period to improve performance before other strategic alternatives are considered 
the company s inability to successfully divest or sell assets in a timely manner could have a negative effect on its operations 
in addition  the process of divestitures could cause strains on the ongoing operations of the company 
third party patents and other intellectual property rights may limit the company s ability to bring new products to market and may subject the company to potential legal liability 
the failure to bring new products to market in a timely manner without incurring legal liability could cause the company to lose market share and its operating results may suffer 
the company s ability to bring new products to market is limited by certain patent  trademark and trade dress factors including  but not limited to  the existence of patents protecting brand products for all business segments and the regulatory exclusivity periods awarded on products 
the cost and time to develop these prescription and switch products is significantly greater than the rest of the new products that the company seeks to introduce 
moreover  the manufacture  use and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights have been the subject of substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical industry 
these lawsuits relate to the validity and infringement of patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
the company may have to defend against charges that it violated patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
the company s defense against charges that it infringed third party patents or proprietary rights could require the company to incur substantial expense and to divert significant effort of its technical and management personnel 
if the company is found to have infringed on the rights of others  it could lose its right to develop or manufacture some products or could be required to pay monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties 
although the parties to patent and intellectual property disputes in the pharmaceutical industry have often settled their disputes through licensing or similar arrangements  the costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  the company cannot be certain that the necessary licenses would be available to it on terms it believes to be acceptable 
as a result  an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent the company from manufacturing and selling a number of its products 
at times  the company may seek approval to market nda or anda products before the expiration of patents for those products  based upon its belief that such patents are invalid  unenforceable or would not be infringed by its products 
as a result  the company may face significant patent litigation 
depending upon a complex analysis of a variety of legal and commercial factors  the company may  in certain circumstances  elect to market a generic pharmaceutical product while litigation is pending  before any court decision or while an appeal of a lower court decision is pending 
this is referred to in the pharmaceutical industry as an at risk launch 
the risk involved in an at risk launch can be substantial because  if a patent holder ultimately prevails  the remedies available to the patent holder may include  among other things  damages measured by the profits lost by the holder  which are often significantly higher than the profits the company makes from selling the generic version of the product 
by electing to proceed in this manner  the company could face substantial damages if a final court decision is adverse to the company 
in the case where a patent holder is able to prove that the company infringement was willful or exceptional  the definition of which is subjective  the patent holder may be awarded up to three times the amount of its actual damages 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company  and its partner synthon  launched levocetirizine tablets  a generic version of xyzal tablets from ucb sepracor prior to the expiration of the relevant patent 
synthon and the company share both the risks and the benefits associated with the at risk launch 
during the third quarter of fiscal  two additional competitors received fda approval and launched generic versions of xyzal tablets 
synthon settled its litigation with the brand in the fourth quarter of fiscal  removing the uncertain nature of potential at risk damages 
the government programs in israel in which the company participates and the tax benefits the company receives require the company to meet several conditions and may be terminated or reduced in the future  which would increase the company s costs and tax expenses 
the company has received grants for research and development from the office of the chief scientist in israel s ministry of industry and trade 
to continue to be eligible for these grants  the company s development projects must be approved by the chief scientist on a case by case basis 
if the company s development projects are not approved by the chief scientist  the company will not receive grants to fund these projects  which would increase research and development costs 
the receipt of such grants subjects the company to certain restrictions and pre approval requirements  which may be conditioned on additional royalty payments with rights to transfer intellectual property and or production abroad 
the company also receives tax benefits  in particular exemptions and reductions  as a result of the approved enterprise status of certain existing operations in israel 
to be eligible for these tax benefits  the company must maintain its approved enterprise status by meeting conditions  including making specified investments in fixed assets located in israel and investing additional equity in itself and its israeli subsidiaries and by meeting projections provided to the regulatory agencies 
if the company fails to meet these conditions in the future  the tax benefits would be canceled  and the company could be required to refund the tax benefits already received 
these tax benefits may not be continued in the future at their current levels or at any level 
if such benefits are reduced or eliminated in the future  the company s results of operations will be adversely impacted 
in the third quarter of fiscal  israel enacted new tax legislation 
this legislation reduced the effective tax rate for qualifying entities to for and  for and  and thereafter 
two of the company entities will be eligible for this benefit and management currently anticipates electing the new legislation for years beginning after fiscal if this election is made as anticipated  the above risk will no longer be applicable for the company for years beginning after fiscal  as the approved enterprise status would no longer be available to the company 
a significant disruption at any of the company s main manufacturing facilities could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial position and results of operations 
the company s us operations are concentrated in michigan  south carolina  new york  vermont  ohio and florida 
approximately of the company s revenues are related to these manufacturing facilities 
the company has concentrated manufacturing facilities in israel  which comprise approximately of the company s revenues 
a significant disruption resulting from  but not limited to  fire  tornado  storm  flood  cyber attacks  material supply  insufficient quality  or pandemic at any of the company s facilities could impair its ability to develop  produce and or ship products on a timely basis  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial position and operating results 
the success of certain of the company s products depends on the effectiveness of its patents and other measures it takes to protect its intellectual property rights 
the company s success with certain of its products depends  in part  on its ability to protect and defend its intellectual property rights 
if the company fails to adequately protect its intellectual property  competitors may manufacture and market similar products 
the company has been issued patents covering certain of its products  and has filed  and expects to continue to file  patent applications seeking to protect newly developed technologies and products in various countries  including the us any existing or future patents issued to or licensed by the company may not provide it with any significant competitive advantages for its products or may even be challenged  invalidated or circumvented by competitors 
in addition  such patent rights may not prevent the company s competitors from developing  using or commercializing non infringing products that are similar or functionally equivalent to its products 
the company also relies on trade secrets  unpatented proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation that it seeks to protect  in part by confidentiality agreements with licensees  suppliers  employees and consultants 
if these agreements are breached  the company may not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
disputes may arise concerning the ownership of intellectual property or the applicability of confidentiality agreements 
furthermore  trade secrets and proprietary technology may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors or  if patents are not issued with respect to products arising from research  the company may not be able to maintain the value of such intellectual property rights 
the company is also increasing its research and development efforts in countries where risks of improper disclosure of trade secrets and proprietary technology are higher than in the united states and israel 
a substantial portion of the sources of raw materials and an increasing volume of sales of the company are outside the united states 
additional legislation or regulation concerning importing exporting may be enacted  which could have an adverse impact on the company s net sales of such products and resulting income 
the company imports and exports products and raw materials from to several jurisdictions around the world 
this process involves company subsidiaries and third parties operating in a number of jurisdictions with different customs and import export regulations 
the regulations are subject to change from time to time and the company cannot predict the nature  scope or impact of these changes upon the company s operations 
the company is subject to periodic reviews and audits by us and foreign authorities responsible for administering these regulations 
to the extent that the company is unable to successfully defend itself against an audit or review  the company may be required to pay assessments  penalties and increased duties  which may  individually or in the aggregate  negatively impact the company s gross margins and operating results 
certain of the company s facilities operate in a special purpose subzone established by the us department of commerce foreign trade zone board  which allows the company certain tax advantages on products and raw materials shipped through these facilities 
if the us department of commerce foreign trade zone board were to revoke the subzone designation or limit its use by the company  the company could be subject to increased duties  which may negatively impact the company s gross margins and operating results 
conducting business in international markets involves risks and uncertainties such as foreign exchange rate exposure and social  political and economic instability that could lead to increased prices for raw materials  reduced international sales and reduced profitability associated with such sales  which could reduce the company s net sales and income 
the company sources certain key raw materials and finished products from foreign suppliers in countries that include  but are not limited to  australia  canada  china  denmark  india and mexico 
the company continues to increase its revenues outside the us the company s primary markets for the sale of its products outside the us are canada  germany  israel  mexico  the uk  china and australia 
the company may have difficulty in international markets due  for example  to regulatory barriers  the necessity of adapting to new regulatory systems and problems related to markets with different cultural bases and political systems and strict adherence to all anti corruption laws including the united states foreign corrupt practices act 
violence and crime in mexico could adversely affect the company s manufacturing activities and ability to recruit and retain employees there 
sales to customers outside the us and foreign raw material purchases expose the company to a number of risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  possible difficulties in enforcing agreements  longer payment cycles  longer shipping lead times  inefficient port operations  exchange rate fluctuations  difficulties obtaining export or import licenses  the imposition of withholding or other taxes  economic or political instability  embargoes  military hostilities or exchange controls 
should any of these risks occur  they may have a material adverse impact on the operating results of the company 
the company is dependent on the services of certain key executive and scientific employees 
the failure to attract and retain such employees may have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
the company s future success will depend in large part upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees 
key functions for the company include executive managers  operational managers  research and development scientists  information technology specialists  financial and legal specialists  regulatory professionals  quality compliance specialists and sales marketing personnel 
should the company be unable to attract or retain key qualified employees  future operating results may be adversely impacted 
changes in estimates regarding fair value of goodwill or intangible assets may result in an adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
the company tests goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists 
the test for impairment requires the company to make several estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
changes in these estimates may result in the recognition of an impairment loss 
the company s testing in the fiscal year resulted in no impairment charges related to goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
other intangible assets consist of a portfolio of individual developed product technology formulation and product rights  distribution and license agreements  customer relationships  non compete agreements and trade names and trademarks 
for intangible assets subject to amortization  an impairment analysis is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any individual asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
any significant change in market conditions  estimates or judgments used to determine expected future cash flows that indicate a reduction in carrying value may give rise to impairment in the period that the change becomes known 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding impairment of intangible assets 
to protect itself against various potential liabilities  the company maintains a variety of insurance programs 
significant increases in the cost or decreases in the availability of such insurance could adversely impact the company s financial condition 
the company maintains insurance  including property  general and product liability  and directors and officers liability  to protect itself against potential loss exposures 
to the extent that losses occur  there could be an adverse effect on the company s financial results depending on the nature of the loss and the level of insurance coverage maintained by the company 
the company cannot predict whether deductible or retention amounts will increase or whether coverage will be reduced in the future 
from time to time  the company may reevaluate and change the types and levels of insurance coverage that it purchases 
the company  like retailers and other distributors and manufacturers of products that are ingested  is exposed to product liability claims in the event that  among other things  the use of its products results in injury 
there is no assurance that product liability insurance will continue to be available to the company at an economically reasonable cost or at all for certain products or that the company s insurance will be adequate to cover liability that the company incurs in connection with product liability claims 
see item legal proceedings 
the company s business is capital intensive and there can be no assurance that financial capital will always be available on favorable terms or at all 
in some instances  the company may determine to issue additional shares of capital stock in order to meet its capital needs  which would dilute existing shareholders

item legal proceedings 
on march   a purported shareholder of the company named michael l 
warner filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york against the company and certain of its officers and directors  including joseph papa and judy brown  among others 
the plaintiff sought to represent a class of purchasers of the company common stock during the period between november  and february  the complaint alleged violations of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of the exchange act 
the plaintiff generally alleged that the company misled investors by failing to disclose  prior to february   that certain auction rate securities held by the company  totaling approximately  in par value the ars  had been purchased from lehman brothers holdings  inc lehman 
the plaintiff asserted that omission of the identity of lehman as the seller of the ars was material because after lehman bankruptcy filing  on september   the company allegedly became unable to look to lehman to repurchase the ars at a price near par value 
the complaint sought unspecified damages and unspecified equitable or injunctive relief  along with costs and attorneys fees 
on june   the court appointed several purported shareholders of the company  namely clal finance batucha investment management  ltd  the phoenix insurance company  ltd  excellence nessuah mutual funds management  ltd 
and excellence nessuah gemel pension  ltd  as co lead plaintiffs 
on july   these co lead plaintiffs filed an amended complaint 
the amended complaint dropped all claims against the individual defendants other than joseph papa and judy brown  and added a control person claim under section a of the exchange act against the members of the company audit committee 
the amended complaint asserts many of the same claims and allegations as the original pleading 
it also alleges that the company should have disclosed  prior to february   that lehman had sold the ars to the company and had provided the allegedly inflated valuation of the ars that the company adopted in its form q filing for the first quarter of fiscal  which was filed with the sec on november  the amended complaint also alleges that some portion of the write down of the value of the ars that the company recognized in the second quarter of fiscal should have been taken in the prior quarter  immediately following lehman bankruptcy filing 
on september   the defendants filed a motion to dismiss all claims against all defendants 
on september   the court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss 
the court dismissed the control person claims against the members of the company audit committee  but denied the motion to dismiss as to the remaining claims and defendants 
on october   the defendants filed a new motion to dismiss the amended complaint on the grounds that the co lead plaintiffs who are the only plaintiffs named in the amended complaint lack standing to sue under the us securities laws following a recent decision of the united states supreme court holding that section b of the exchange act does not apply extraterritorially to the claims of foreign investors who purchased or sold securities on foreign stock exchanges 
the motion to dismiss is pending 
on december   a shareholder named harel insurance  ltd 
harel filed a motion to intervene as an additional named plaintiff 
although harel is a non us investor  it claims to have purchased the company common stock on a us exchange 
on january   the original plaintiff  warner  filed a motion renewing his previously withdrawn motion to be appointed as lead plaintiff to replace the co lead plaintiffs 
these motions are pending 
on june   a purported shareholder of the company named bill drinkwine filed a purported shareholder derivative complaint in the circuit court of allegan county  michigan against a number of officers and directors of the company  including certain of the officers and directors named as defendants in the federal securities suit described above  as well as others 
like the federal securities suit  the state court complaint alleged that the company misled investors by failing to disclose  prior to february   that the ars had been purchased from lehman and allegedly became worthless when lehman filed for bankruptcy 
the complaint asserted that the officer and director defendants violated their fiduciary duties to the company by selling shares of their personally held perrigo stock during the five month period between lehman bankruptcy filing and the company february  disclosure of the write down of the value of the ars 
the complaint sought to recover for perrigo the proceeds received by the officer and director defendants from such stock sales 
prior to filing the suit  on march   mr 
drinkwine made a demand on the company board of directors that perrigo bring the suit directly against the accused officers and directors 
in response to that demand  the perrigo board appointed a committee of all independent  disinterested directors as defined by the michigan business corporation act to investigate mr 
drinkwine allegations 
the committee retained independent counsel to assist it in that investigation 
the committee and its counsel conducted an investigation and concluded that mr 
drinkwine allegations were without merit and  consequently  that it would not be in perrigo best interests for the suit to go forward 
based on the findings of that investigation  on august   the company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to section of the michigan business corporation act  which provides that when a committee of all independent  disinterested directors makes a good faith determination  based upon a reasonable investigation  that the maintenance of a derivative suit would not be in the best interests of the corporation  the court shall dismiss the derivative proceeding 
on november   the court granted the company dismissal motion and terminated the case 
mr 
drinkwine did not appeal that ruling 
in march and june of  lawsuits were filed by three separate groups against both the state of israel and the council of ramat hovav in connection with waste disposal and pollution from several companies  including the company  that have operations in the ramat hovav region of israel 
these lawsuits were subsequently consolidated into a single proceeding in the district court of beer sheva 
the council of ramat hovav in june  and the state of israel  in november  asserted third party claims against several companies  including the company 
the pleadings allege a variety of personal injuries arising out of the alleged environmental pollution 
neither the plaintiffs nor the third party claimants were required to specify a maximum amount of damages  but the pleadings allege damages in excess of  subject to foreign currency fluctuations between the israeli shekel and the us dollar 
while the company intends to vigorously defend against these claims  the company cannot reasonably predict at this time  the outcome or the liability  if any  associated with these claims 
in addition to the foregoing discussion  the company has pending certain other legal actions and claims incurred in the normal course of business 
the company believes that it has meritorious defenses to these lawsuits and or is covered by insurance and is actively pursuing the defense thereof 
the company believes the resolution of all of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations as reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
however  depending on the amount and timing of an unfavorable resolution of these lawsuits  the company s future results of operations or cash flow could be materially impacted in a particular period

item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview perrigo company the company traces its history back to what was started as a small local proprietor selling medicinals to regional grocers has evolved into a leading global pharmaceutical company that manufactures and distributes more than billion oral solid doses and several hundred million liquid doses  as well as dozens of other product forms  each year 
the company s mission is to offer uncompromised quality  affordable healthcare products  and it does so across a wide variety of product categories primarily in the us  uk  mexico  israel and australia  as well as certain other markets throughout the world  including canada  china and latin america 
segments the company has four reportable segments  aligned primarily by type of product consumer healthcare  nutritionals  rx pharmaceuticals and api 
in addition  the company has an other category that consists of the israel pharmaceutical and diagnostic products operating segment  which does not individually meet the quantitative thresholds required to be a separately reportable segment 
the consumer healthcare segment is the world s largest store brand manufacturer of over the counter otc pharmaceutical products 
this business markets products that are comparable in quality and effectiveness to national brand products 
the cost to the retailer of a store brand product is significantly lower than that of a comparable nationally advertised brand name product 
the retailer  therefore  can price a store brand product below the competing national brand product yet realize a greater profit margin 
generally the retailers dollar profit per unit of store brand product is greater than the dollar profit per unit of the comparable national brand product 
the consumer benefits by receiving a high quality product at a price below the comparable national brand product 
therefore  the company business model saves consumers on their annual healthcare spending 
the company  one of the original architects of private label pharmaceuticals  is the market leader for consumer healthcare products in many of the geographies where it currently competes the us  us  and mexico 
the company market share of store brand private label otc products has grown in recent years as new products  retailer efforts and economic events have directed consumers to the value of store brand product offerings 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company realigned and expanded its reportable segments to include its nutritionals segment  representing infant formulas and other nutritional products 
this realignment followed the company s acquisition  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  of pbm holdings  inc pbm  the leading manufacturer and distributor of store brand infant formulas  pediatric nutritionals and baby foods sold by leading retailers in the mass  club  grocery and drug channels in the us  canada  mexico and china 
this segment structure is consistent with the way management makes operating decisions and manages the growth and profitability of the company s business 
as a result of the change in segment reporting  all historical information has been adjusted to conform to the new presentation 
the nutritionals segment manufactures  markets and distributes infant formula products  infant and toddler foods  vitamin  mineral and dietary supplement vms products  and oral electrolyte solution products to retailers and consumers in the us  canada  mexico and china 
similar to the consumer healthcare segment  this business markets products that are comparable in quality and effectiveness to the national brand products 
the cost to the retailer of a store brand product is significantly lower than that of a comparable nationally advertised brand name product 
the retailer  therefore  can price a store brand product below the competing national brand product yet realize a greater profit margin 
all infant formulas sold in the us are subject to the same regulations governing manufacturing and ingredients under the infant formula act 
store brands  which are value priced and offer substantial savings to consumers  must meet the same us food and drug administration fda nutritional requirements as the national brands 
the rx pharmaceuticals segment develops  manufactures and markets a portfolio of generic prescription rx drugs in the us the company defines this portfolio as predominantly extended topical in nature as it encompasses a broad array of topicals including creams  ointments  lotions  gels  shampoos  foams  suppositories  sprays  liquids  suspensions and solutions 
the strategy in the rx pharmaceuticals segment is to be the first to market with those new products that are exposed to less competition because they have more difficult to develop formulations and cost much more to complete 
in addition  the rx pharmaceuticals segment offers otc products through the prescription channel referred to as orx marketing 
orx products are otc products that are available for pharmacy fulfillment and healthcare reimbursement when prescribed by a physician 
the company offers over orx products that are reimbursable through many health plans and medicaid and medicare programs 
when prescribed by a doctor or other healthcare professional  orx products offer consumers safe and effective remedies that provide an affordable alternative to the higher out of pocket costs of traditional otc products 
the company s orx strategy is to register otc products for reimbursement through public and private health plans  as well as leverage its portfolio and pipeline of otc products for generic substitution when appropriate 
the recent acquisition of paddock laboratories  inc paddock  which closed subsequent to the company fiscal year end on july   expanded the company s generic rx product offering  pipeline and scale 
the api segment develops  manufactures and markets active pharmaceutical ingredients api used worldwide by the generic drug industry and branded pharmaceutical companies 
the strategy of the api segment is to focus development efforts on the synthesis of less common molecules for its customers  as well as for the more complex products within the consumer healthcare and rx pharmaceuticals development pipelines 
this segment is undergoing a strategic platform transformation  moving certain production from israel to the acquired api manufacturing facility in india to allow for lower cost production and to create space for other  more complex production in israel 
the fiscal sale of the company s facility in germany also supports this footprint change 
in addition to general management and strategic leadership  each business segment has its own sales and marketing teams focused on servicing the specific requirements of its customer base 
all of these business segments share research development r d  supply chain  information technology  finance  human resources  legal and quality services  all of which are directed out of the company s headquarters in allegan  michigan 
over recent years  the company has been executing a strategy designed to expand its product offering through both advanced r d and acquisitions and to reach new healthcare consumers through entry into new markets 
this strategy is accomplished by investing in and continually improving all aspects of its five strategic pillars high quality  superior customer service  leading innovation  best cost and empowered people 
the concentration of common shared service activities around the world and development of centers of excellence in r d have played an important role in ensuring the consistency and quality of the company s five strategic pillars 
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and all majority owned subsidiaries 
all intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 
prior to june   the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position included the financial results of its uk  mexico  germany and israel subsidiaries on a twelve month period ending in may  resulting in a one month reporting lag when compared to the remainder of the company 
starting june   the reporting year end of these foreign operations was changed from may to june 
the previously existing one month reporting lag was eliminated as it was no longer required to achieve a timely consolidation due to the company s investments in technology  erp systems and personnel to enhance its financial statement close process 
the company believes this change is preferable because financial information of all operating units is now reported based on the same period end  which improves overall financial reporting to investors by providing the most current information available 
the company s financial statements for periods prior to fiscal have been adjusted to reflect the period specific effects of applying this change in accounting principle 
this change resulted in a cumulative effect of an accounting change of  net of income tax effect  to retained earnings as of june  the impact of this change in accounting principle to eliminate the one month lag for foreign subsidiaries is summarized in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s fiscal year is a or week period  which ends the saturday on or about june fiscal years  and were comprised of weeks and ended june   june  and june   respectively 
fiscal will be comprised of weeks ending june  as a result  the company operating results for fiscal will include results related to this additional week 
current year results net sales from continuing operations for fiscal were  an increase of over fiscal the increase was driven primarily by approximately  of net sales attributable to the acquisitions of pbm and orion laboratories pty  ltd 
orion and new product sales of approximately  gross profit of  was an increase of over fiscal the gross profit percentage in fiscal was  which is higher than the fiscal gross profit percentage of due primarily to new products and the acquisition of pbm in fiscal operating expenses were  an increase of over fiscal  due primarily to the impact of acquisitions 
as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses were  down from in fiscal income from continuing operations was  an increase of over fiscal net income was  an increase of over fiscal new products  strong demand for the company s otc products  strategic acquisitions and strict cost management all contributed to the record growth in fiscal cash flow from operations of  was also an historic record as a result of the company growth of net income 
further details related to current year results are included below under results of continuing operations 
growth strategy and strategic transactions management expects to continue to grow the company both organically and inorganically 
the company continually reinvests in its own r d pipeline and at the same time also works with partners as necessary to strive to be first to market with new products 
recent years have seen strong organic growth as a series of very successful new products have been launched in consumer healthcare 
inorganic growth is expected to be achieved through continued expansion into adjacent products  product categories and channels  as well as new geographic markets 
while ever conscious of the challenges associated with the current economic environment  the company continues to identify opportunities to grow and at the same time positions itself to address the uncertainties that lie ahead 
in fiscal  the company continued its strategic growth in adjacent product categories with the announcement of the paddock acquisition in january and entered into an exclusive agreement with agamatrix in february to sell and distribute blood glucose monitors and test strips in the us store brand channel 
the paddock acquisition  which was completed subsequent to fiscal  expanded the company s generic rx product offering  pipeline and scale 
fiscal geographic expansion included the commencement of otc infant formula sales to costco in canada  along with continued regulatory progress related to the company recent acquisition of orion laboratories in australia  where the company received  in various forms  over product approvals from the tga with another pending 
strategic evaluations and transformations the company s management evaluates business performance using a return on invested capital roic metric 
this includes evaluating the performance of business segments  manufacturing locations  product categories and capital projects 
business segments performance is expected to meet or exceed the company s weighted average cost of capital wacc each year 
all potential acquisition targets are evaluated on whether they have the capacity to deliver an roic in excess of to percentage points over the company wacc within three years 
capital expenditures and large projects are required to demonstrate that they will contribute positively on roic in excess of the company s wacc 
as part of this annual strategic review of consolidated roic  in march  the company committed to a plan to sell its israel consumer products business 
the financial results of this business  which were previously reported as part of the company other category  have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
the sale was completed in the third quarter of fiscal after the finalization of post closing working capital adjustments in the third quarter of fiscal  the sale resulted in a pre tax loss of  unless otherwise noted  amounts and disclosures throughout management discussion and analysis relate to the company s continuing operations 
see note of the the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations 
also  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company evaluated the api business in the context of the expected future competitive dynamics in api and the company s strategic focus on specialty molecules and vertical integration 
management determined that the german api facility was no longer competitive from a global cost position 
at that time  the company did not anticipate that there would be a viable market for the sale of this facility and related operations  and accordingly  the company planned to cease all operations at the facility during the first quarter of fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  however  the company was approached by an external party who offered to buy the german api facility and related operations from the company 
subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal  the company signed an agreement and closed the transaction with the third party buyer for the sale of the german api facility and related operations 
as part of its german restructuring plan  the company incurred net charges of  and  in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  respectively 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the sale of the german api facility and related operations

the facility  located approximately miles outside of mumbai  is currently under construction and will manufacture the company s current and future high volume api products  as well as expand the company s vertical integration of rx and future candidate rx to otc switch products 
manufacturing of api at this facility is expected to begin in the second half of fiscal and will include certain api products currently manufactured in israel and those that had been manufactured in germany 
refer to item business for additional information regarding each of these strategic transactions 
capital and liquidity the company s goal in managing its capital structure is to provide sufficient liquidity to enable it to pursue its business goals and objectives while optimizing long term flexibility 
over its recent history  the company has placed increased focus on the importance of funding a majority of its core objectives through cash flows from operations 
management is incented to achieve improved cash flows from operations through individual segment operating income and working capital targets and strives to achieve annual cash flows from operations greater than net income 
historically  the company has targeted capital expenditures at a level to approximate annual depreciation expense 
capital expenditures for fiscal were at higher levels to allow for capacity expansion  quality and technology investments  api strategic transformations and integration of acquisitions 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be at or slightly above fiscal levels to allow for continued manufacturing productivity and capacity projects  quality and technology investments  investments at newly acquired entities  market driven packaging changes and the api expansion into india 
the company has historically provided shareholder return of capital through its dividend policy  payments under which have increased steadily over recent years 
share repurchases authorized by the company s board of directors are evaluated against alternative uses of cash  such as acquisitions and debt repayments  and when approved are typically made at levels to help offset the dilutive effects of share based compensation awards

the company s israeli subsidiary paid the third and final annual installment of its debenture in the second quarter of fiscal for  the debenture  which was guaranteed by the company  had a fixed interest rate of  and the principal of the loan was linked to the increase in the israel consumer price index 
contractual obligations the company s enforceable and legally binding obligations as of june  are set forth in the following table 
some of the amounts included in this table are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations  including the duration  the possibility of renewal  anticipated actions by third parties and other factors 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the enforceable and legally binding obligations actually paid in future periods may vary from the amounts reflected in the table 
in addition  it does not include any contractual obligations or commercial commitments the company incurred as a result of the recently completed acquisition of paddock 
payment due by period after total operating leases purchase obligations short and long term debt other non current contractual liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheet deferred compensation and benefits other total used in normal course of business  principally for warehouse facilities and computer equipment 
consists of commitments for both materials and services 
short and long term debt includes interest payments  which were calculated using the effective interest rate at june  includes amounts associated with non qualified plans related to deferred compensation  executive retention and post employment benefits 
of this amount   has been funded by the company and is recorded in other non current assets on the balance sheet 
these amounts are assumed payable after five years  although certain circumstances  such as termination  would require earlier payment 
the company funds its us qualified profit sharing and investment plan in accordance with the employee retirement income security act of regulations for the minimum annual required contribution and internal revenue service regulations for the maximum annual allowable tax deduction 
the company is committed to making the required minimum contributions  which the company expects to be approximately  during fiscal future contributions are dependent upon various factors including employees eligible compensation  plan participation and changes  if any  to current funding requirements 
therefore  no amounts were included in the contractual obligations table above 
the company generally expects to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operating activities 
as of june   the company had approximately  of liabilities for uncertain tax positions 
these unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to uncertainty as to the amounts and timing of settlement with taxing authorities 
net deferred income tax liabilities were  as of june  this amount is not included in the contractual obligations table above because the company believes this presentation would not be meaningful 
net deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their book basis  which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the book basis is settled 
the results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods 
as a result  scheduling net deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading  because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs 
critical accounting estimates determination of certain amounts in the company s financial statements requires the use of estimates 
these estimates are based upon the company s historical experiences combined with management s understanding of current facts and circumstances 
although the estimates are considered reasonable  actual results could differ from the estimates 
the accounting estimates  discussed below  are considered by management to require the most judgment and are critical in the preparation of the financial statements 
these estimates are reviewed by the audit committee 
revenue recognition and customer related accruals and allowances the company records revenues from product sales when the goods are shipped to the customer 
for customers with free on board fob destination terms  a provision is recorded to exclude shipments estimated to be in transit to these customers at the end of the reporting period 
a provision is recorded and accounts receivable are reduced as revenues are recognized for estimated losses on credit sales due to customer claims for discounts  price discrepancies  returned goods and other items 
a liability is recorded as revenues are recognized for estimated customer program liabilities  as discussed below 
the company maintains customer related accruals and allowances that consist primarily of chargebacks  rebates and shelf stock adjustments 
certain of these accruals and allowances are recorded in the balance sheet as current liabilities and others are recorded as a reduction in accounts receivable 
a chargeback relates to an agreement the company has with a wholesaler  pharmaceutical buying group or retail customer that will ultimately purchase product from a wholesaler for a contracted price that is different than the company s price to the wholesaler 
the wholesaler will issue an invoice to the company for the difference in the contract prices 
the accrual for chargebacks is based on historical chargeback experience and confirmed wholesaler inventory levels  as well as estimated sell through levels by wholesalers to retailers 
rebates are payments issued to the customer when certain criteria are met which may include specific levels of product purchases  introduction of new products or other objectives 
the accrual for rebates is based on contractual agreements and estimated purchasing levels by customers with such programs 
medicaid rebates are payments made to states for pharmaceutical products covered by the program 
the accrual for medicaid rebates is based on historical trends of rebates paid and current period sales activity 
shelf stock adjustments are credits issued to reflect decreases in the selling price of a product and are based upon estimates of the amount of product remaining in a customer s inventory at the time of the anticipated price reduction 
in many cases  the customer is contractually entitled to such a credit 
the allowances for shelf stock adjustments are based on specified terms with certain customers  estimated launch dates of competing products and estimated declines in market price 
changes in these estimates and assumptions may result in additional customer related accruals and allowances 
the following table summarizes activity for the fiscal years ended june  and june  in the balance sheet for customer related accruals and allowances fiscal year customer related accruals and allowances balance  beginning of period provision recorded credits processed balance  end of the period revenues from service and royalty arrangements  including revenues from collaborative agreements  consist primarily of royalty payments  payments for research and development services  up front fees and milestone payments 
if an arrangement requires the delivery or performance of multiple deliverables or service elements  the company determines whether the individual elements represent separate units of accounting under the requirements of asc subtopic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements asc 
if the separate elements meet the requirements of asc  the company recognizes the revenue associated with each element separately and revenue is allocated among elements based on the residual method 
if the elements within a multiple deliverable arrangement are not considered separate units of accounting  the delivery of an individual element is considered not to have occurred if there are undelivered elements that are considered essential to the arrangement 
to the extent such arrangements contain refund clauses triggered by non performance or other adverse circumstances  revenue is not recognized until all contractual obligations are satisfied 
non refundable up front fees are deferred and amortized to revenue over the related performance period 
the company estimates the performance period based on the specific terms of each collaborative agreement 
revenue associated with research and development services is recognized on a proportional performance basis over the period that the company performs the related activities under the terms of the agreement 
revenue resulting from the achievement of contingent milestone events stipulated in the agreements is recognized when the milestone is achieved 
milestones are based upon the occurrence of a substantive element specified in the contract 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts that reduces receivables to amounts that are expected to be collected 
in estimating the allowance  management considers factors such as current overall and industry specific economic conditions  statutory requirements  historical and anticipated customer performance  historical experience with write offs and the level of past due amounts 
changes in these conditions may result in additional allowances 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was  at june  and  at june  inventory reserves the company maintains reserves for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventory based on the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value 
in estimating the reserves  management considers factors such as excess or slow moving inventories  product expiration dating  products on quality hold  current and future customer demand and market conditions 
changes in these conditions may result in additional reserves 
income taxes the company effective income tax rate is based on income  statutory tax rates  special tax benefits and tax planning opportunities available to the company in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities 
significant judgment is required in determining the company tax expense and in evaluating tax positions 
tax positions are reviewed quarterly and balances are adjusted as new information becomes available 
the company has established valuation allowances against a portion of the non us net operating losses  non us capital losses  non us state related net operating losses and us capital losses to reflect the uncertainty of its ability to fully utilize these benefits given the limited carryforward periods permitted by the various jurisdictions 
the evaluation of the company ability to realize net operating and capital losses requires the use of considerable management judgment to estimate the future taxable income for the various jurisdictions  for which the ultimate amounts and timing of such realization may differ 
the valuation allowances can also be impacted by changes in the tax regulations 
significant judgment is required in determining the company liabilities for uncertain tax positions 
the company has established such tax liabilities using management best judgment and adjusts these liabilities as warranted by changing facts and circumstances 
a change in tax liabilities in any given period could have a significant impact on the company results of operations and cash flows for that period 
goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists 
the test for impairment requires the company to make several estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows and market valuation multiples 
the estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the judgments required in determining fair value amounts  including projected future cash flows 
changes in these estimates may result in the recognition of an impairment loss 
the company performs its annual goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets impairment testing for all of its reporting units in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
the company s rx and api businesses are heavily dependent on new products currently under development 
the termination of certain key product development projects could have a materially adverse impact on the future results of the rx pharmaceuticals or api segment  which may include a charge for goodwill impairment 
a change in market dynamics or failure of operational execution for the company s consumer healthcare uk  mexico and australia operations could result in a materially adverse impact on its future results  which could result in a charge for goodwill impairment 
goodwill was  at june  and  at june  other intangible assets other intangible assets consist of a portfolio of individual developed product technology formulation and product rights  distribution and license agreements  customer relationships  non compete agreements and trade names and trademarks 
the assets categorized as developed product technology formulation and product rights  certain distribution and license agreements and non compete agreements are amortized over their estimated useful economic lives using the straight line method 
an accelerated method of amortization is used for customer relationships and certain distribution agreements 
certain trade names and trademarks are determined to have an indefinite useful life and are not subject to amortization 
the company  however  reviews them for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that any individual asset might be impaired  and adjusts the carrying value of the asset as necessary 
for intangible assets subject to amortization  an impairment analysis is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any individual asset may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
other intangible assets had a net carrying value of  at june  and  at june  recently issued accounting standards see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding recently issued accounting standards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
the company is exposed to market risks due to changes in interest rates  the liquidity of the securities markets and currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of interest income earned on its investment of cash on hand and interest expense on borrowings used to finance acquisitions and working capital requirements 
the company enters into certain derivative financial instruments  when available on a cost effective basis  to hedge its underlying economic exposure  related to the management of interest rate risk 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company s derivative and hedging activities 
because of the use of certain derivative financial instruments and the significant amount of fixed rate debt  the company believes that a fluctuation in interest rates in the near future will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
these instruments are managed on a consolidated basis to efficiently net exposures and thus take advantage of any natural offsets 
derivative financial instruments are not used for speculative purposes 
gains and losses on hedging transactions are offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposures being hedged 
market risk the company s investment securities include ars totaling  in par value 
ars are privately placed variable rate debt instruments whose interest rates are reset within a contractual range  approximately every to days 
with the tightening of the credit markets beginning in calendar  ars have failed to settle at auction resulting in an illiquid market for these types of securities 
although the company continues to earn and collect interest on these investments at the maximum contractual rate  the estimated fair value of ars cannot be determined by the auction process until liquidity is restored to these markets 
while there are some recent indications that a market is starting to materialize for these securities  though at a much reduced level than the pre period  the company cannot predict when liquidity will return for these securities 
the company has reclassified the securities from current assets to other non current assets due to the unpredictable nature and the illiquidity of the market for the securities 
the company currently engages the services of an independent third party valuation firm to assist it in estimating the current fair value of the ars  using a discounted cash flow analysis and an assessment of secondary markets  as well as other factors 
during the second and fourth quarters of fiscal  the company received updated estimates of the current fair value of these securities from the valuation firm and based on these estimations and other factors  the company recorded an unrealized gain of  and  net of tax  in other comprehensive income in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal  respectively 
the company will continue to monitor the credit worthiness of the companies that issued these securities and other appropriate factors and make such adjustments as it deems necessary to reflect the fair value of these securities 
foreign exchange risk the company has operations in the uk  israel  mexico and australia 
these operations transact business in their local currency and foreign currencies  thereby creating exposures to changes in exchange rates 
a large portion of the sales of the company s israeli operations is in foreign currencies  primarily us dollars and euros  while these operations incur costs in their local currency 
in addition  the company us operations continue to expand its export business  primarily in canada  china and europe and is subject to fluctuations in the respective currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
due to sales and cost structures  certain segments experience a negative impact as a result of the changes in exchange rates while other segments experience a positive impact related to foreign currency exchange 
the company estimates an additional ten percent devaluation of the us dollar relative to the other foreign currencies it transacts business in would have decreased operating income of its foreign operating units by approximately  for fiscal this sensitivity analysis has inherent limitations 
the analysis disregards the possibility that rates of multiple foreign currencies will not always move in the same direction relative to the value of the us dollar over time 
in addition  the company enters into certain purchase commitments for materials which  although denominated in us dollars  are linked to foreign currency valuations 
these commitments generally contain a range for which the price of materials may fluctuate over time given the value of a foreign currency 
the translation of the assets and liabilities of the company s international operations is made using their foreign exchange rates as of the end of the year 
translation adjustments are not included in determining net income but are disclosed in accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity on the consolidated balance sheets until a sale or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the international subsidiary takes place 
in certain markets  the company could recognize a significant gain or loss related to unrealized cumulative translation adjustments if it were to exit the market and liquidate its net investment 
as of june   the cumulative net currency translation adjustments increased shareholders equity by  foreign currency transaction gains and losses arise from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than an operating unit s functional currency 
for fiscal  net transaction losses were the company monitors and strives to manage risk related to foreign currency exchange rates 
exposures that cannot be naturally offset within a local entity to an immaterial amount are often hedged with foreign currency derivatives or netted with offsetting exposures at other entities 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company s derivative and hedging activities 
the company cannot predict future changes in foreign currency exposure 
unfavorable fluctuations could adversely impact earnings
