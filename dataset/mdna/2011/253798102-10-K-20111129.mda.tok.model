item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading provider of machine to machine mm networking products and solutions that enable the connection  monitoring and control of local or remote physical assets by electronic means 
these networking products and solutions connect communication hardware to a physical asset so that information about that asset s status and performance can be sent to a computer system and used to improve or automate one or more processes 
increasingly these products and solutions are deployed via wireless networks 
our hardware products have been the historical foundation of our business 
in  we introduced a cloud based internet platform idigi which our customers can utilize to monitor and control electronic devices 
our products are deployed by a wide range of businesses and institutions 
we have a single operating and reporting segment 
our revenues consist of products that are in non embedded and embedded product categories 
non embedded products are connected externally to a device or larger system to provide wired or wireless network connectivity or port expansion  while embedded products are used by a product developer to build an electronic device in which the product provides processing power  wired ethernet  or wireless network connectivity to that device 
the products included in the non embedded product category include cellular products  wireless communication adapters  console and serial servers  usb connected products and serial cards 
the products included in the embedded product category include modules  single board computers  chips  software and development tools  design services and satellite communication products 
we utilize many financial  operational  and other metrics to evaluate both our financial condition and our financial performance 
below we highlight the results of those financial metrics that we feel are most important in these evaluations net sales were approximately million 
our net sales were million in fiscal  and increased by compared to net sales of approximately million in fiscal wireless product net sales increased by million  providing the majority of the million increase in revenue from fiscal to fiscal gross profit was approximately million 
gross profit increased by in fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal our gross margin increased as a percentage of net sales to in fiscal from in fiscal we focused on cost reduction initiatives that allowed us to reduce the cost of our products and increase gross profit through purchasing and manufacturing efficiencies during the fiscal year 
favorable customer and product mix  as well as a decrease in the amortization of purchased and core technology as certain intangibles were fully amortized  also contributed to this increase 
we expect to continue to focus on gross margin as we implement our global strategy of consolidation and production centers to drive more efficiency improvements and enhance customer service 
operating expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales in fiscal from fiscal operating expenses were million or of net sales in fiscal versus million or of net sales in fiscal the increase in total operating expenses was largely compensation related and resulted from a net increase in headcount of people as well as higher non sales incentive compensation expenses 
we also invested in our idigi cloud based platform during fiscal as we worked to evolve our business model 
despite these increases  operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased during fiscal compared to fiscal 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview continued net income in fiscal was million 
our net income increased by million to million in fiscal  or  over net income of million in fiscal we leveraged the increase in net sales  combined with cost reduction initiatives and lower operating expenses as a percent of net sales to improve our profitability 
our balance sheet and cash from operations are strong 
our current ratio was to in fiscal compared to to in fiscal cash from operations was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal we accomplished a number of key initiatives in fiscal and also faced significant challenges relative to our business 
accomplishments we increased revenue and earnings per diluted share in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year and maintained a strong balance sheet and cash flows which we believe provides a solid foundation for growing our business 
we reduced our manufacturing costs for future periods by consolidating our breisach  germany operations with our us production facility 
we invested significantly in the development of the idigi device cloud platform and enhanced our capability to develop customized software applications that leverage idigi  which expands our ability to provide end to end solutions to our customers 
we finished fiscal with over  companies using the idigi device cloud 
challenges the global economic environment was volatile in fiscal we monitor our bookings  backlog and anticipated shipments on a weekly basis which allows us to stay abreast of rapidly changing economic conditions as we forecast our revenue 
the strengthening of foreign currencies  particularly the euro and the british pound  created net foreign currency losses due to balances held abroad in non functional currencies such as the us dollar 
we put in place natural hedging and other strategies to minimize this exposure 
since certain of our components and other materials are purchased from regions susceptible to natural disasters as most recently seen in japan and thailand  we faced challenges in procuring certain components and other materials used in manufacturing 
we believe the impact to our business in fiscal from the japan natural disaster was minimal  and we addressed this primarily through the purchase of additional safety stock for component parts normally sourced from that region 
as previously announced  the recent flooding in thailand has affected the operations of one of our contract manufacturers and this will impact our operations and financial results during fiscal 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview continued we believe we are approaching the inflection point in the wireless mm market  and that we are uniquely positioned for growth as we are able to provide customers with complete networking solutions 
the development of a cloud based platform is a critical component of our overall solution and go to market strategy  and we focused significant human capital and financial resources on this initiative  while also managing our other strategic objectives 
in order to continue to improve our financial and operational performance  address the growth of our business and meet our goal of becoming the leading global provider of wireless mm networking products and end to end solutions  we believe we must focus on the following key priorities continue delivery of products and solutions to the following four vertical markets that we believe promise extensive growth opportunities energy  fleet  medical and tank  enhance our capacity to develop software applications and our idigi cloud based platform and migrate our sales and marketing efforts towards end to end solutions as opposed to sales of hardware products alone  and further expand our strategic relationships with leading equipment manufacturers  application providers and systems integrators

this was partially offset by decreases in sales of serial cards  wireless communication adaptors and usb connected products 
usb connected products have decreased due to softening of the retail sector for retail point of sale related usb applications in fiscal increased sales to customers in the medical and fleet vertical markets contributed to the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal non embedded products net sales increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was mostly due to an increase in net sales of cellular products  serial servers  wireless communication adaptors and usb products 
embedded embedded products net sales increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal due mostly to increases of net sales of modules  engineering design services and chips 
increased sales to customers in the medical vertical market contributed to the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal embedded products net sales increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to a million increase in net sales of modules and satellite related products  partially offset by a decrease of million primarily related to large sales of a discontinued chip set in fiscal net sales by wireless and wired categories the following table presents our revenue by wireless and wired categories net sales of net sales in millions wireless wired total wireless products net sales have increased by in fiscal compared to fiscal and in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of our continued investment and focus on wireless mm products and solutions 
as is the trend with respect to the use of telecommunications generally  we anticipate that our sales of wireless products will continue to grow proportionately faster than our sales of wired products

the gross margin for fiscal was compared to in fiscal gross margin increased percentage points primarily due to a reduction of costs as a result of the business restructuring in fiscal and other cost reduction initiatives and also increased percentage points related to a reduction in amortization of purchased and core technology as some technology is fully amortized 
this was partially offset by a percentage points decrease in gross margin due to unfavorable product mix primarily related to cellular and certain embedded products 
amortization of purchased and core technology was million or of net sales in fiscal as compared to million or of net sales in fiscal operating expenses compared to operating expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million or  compared to million in fiscal mostly due to increased compensation related expenses of million  including salaries and incentive compensation  as we fully reinstated our non sales incentive program for fiscal and increased headcount by employees  primarily in sales  marketing and research and development

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued restructuring restructuring on july   we announced a restructuring of our manufacturing operations in breisach  germany 
the restructuring reduced our manufacturing footprint by consolidating prototype and production functions and centralizing outsourced production control in our eden prairie  minnesota production facility 
the consolidation was driven by our strategy of driving efficiency improvements and enhancing customer service globally through more centralized operations 
we will continue to maintain sales and research and development activities at the leased facility in breisach  germany 
as a result of these initiatives  we expect the total charge to be million on a pre tax basis  which consists of million for employee termination costs for employees and million for asset write downs 
we recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and expect to record charges of million in the first quarter of fiscal and million in the second quarter of fiscal the payments are expected to be completed in the second quarter of fiscal we expect to cease manufacturing in breisach by the end of december and the majority of the manufacturing positions will be vacated by the end of december restructuring on april  we announced a business restructuring to increase our focus on wireless products and solutions that include hardware  software and services 
the restructuring included the closing of an engineering facility in long beach  california  and the relocation and consolidation of the manufacturing facility in davis  california to our minnetonka  minnesota headquarters 
we paid a lease cancellation fee for one of the leased facilities in davis and had vacated the facility as of september  we continue to maintain non manufacturing activities at the remaining leased facility in davis  california 
as a result of these initiatives  during the third quarter of fiscal we recorded a million charge  which consisted of million for employee termination costs for positions and million for contract termination fees and other relocation costs 
all positions were vacated as of september  the employee termination costs included severance and the associated costs of continued medical benefits and outplacement services 
the other restructuring expenses included contract termination fees for non renewal of lease terms relating to one of the facilities in davis  california and relocation expenses for employees 
during fiscal  we recorded an additional million for an additional six months of continued medical benefits as a result of new healthcare legislation passed in december related to the aforementioned restructuring 
also during fiscal we reversed million of the restructuring accrual since costs associated with continued medical benefits and relocation were lower than expected 
during fiscal  we paid a small amount of employee termination costs and reversed the remaining restructuring accrual 
other expense income  net compared to other expense income  net was million of expense in fiscal  a decrease of million compared to million of income in fiscal the majority of this was due to million of foreign currency net transaction losses in fiscal compared to foreign currency net transaction gains of million in fiscal we realized interest income on marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal our average investment balance increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  but our interest income was less than in the prior fiscal year since we earned an average interest rate of in fiscal compared to in fiscal

other income  net also increased million related to a net increase in foreign currency transaction gains in fiscal compared to fiscal income taxes our effective income tax rate was  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate will vary based on a variety of factors  including overall profitability  the geographical mix of income before taxes and related statutory tax rate in each jurisdiction  and discrete events  such as settlements of audits 
during fiscal  we recorded a tax benefit of million primarily related to the release of income tax reserves due to the expiration of the statutes of limitations from various jurisdictions  primarily foreign 
the enactment of the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization  and job creation act of provided for the extension of the research and development tax credit that allowed us to record a benefit for tax credits earned during the last three quarters of fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal the aforementioned income tax benefits resulting from the reversal of income tax reserves and other discrete tax benefits reduced our effective tax rate by percentage points in fiscal during fiscal  we reversed million in income tax reserves associated primarily with the closing of prior tax years through statute expiration and the conclusion of a federal tax audit 
while the statutes of limitations have not expired  us federal income tax returns for the periods ended september  and september  have been audited by and settled with the internal revenue service 
the aforementioned income tax benefits resulting from the reversal of income tax reserves and other discrete tax benefits reduced the effective tax rate by percentage points in fiscal during fiscal  we reversed million in income tax reserves primarily associated with the statutory closing of a prior us federal and state tax year and settlement of prior liabilities under amnesty programs

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued subsequent event on october   we announced that the flooding in thailand has impacted the operations of our contract manufacturer located near bangkok  thailand 
the main manufacturing facility is currently closed  although efforts are underway to restore operations at the contract manufacturer s back up facility  which has not currently been impacted by flooding and is also located in bangkok 
in addition  we are working on reallocating production normally done in thailand to our us manufacturing facility  as well as other contract manufacturers we currently use 
we presently anticipate that the thailand flooding and the resulting impact on our subcontract manufacturer in thailand will decrease revenue in a range of approximately million to million for the first fiscal quarter of  and gross margin will decrease by approximately two percentage points in the first fiscal quarter of we expect that the impact of the thailand flooding for the full fiscal year will have a minimal impact on revenue  and the impact to gross margin will be approximately one percentage point 
we expect that earnings per diluted share for fiscal will be reduced by approximately due to the revenue and gross margin impact previously described 
inflation management believes that during fiscal years  and  inflation has not had a material effect on our operations or on our consolidated financial position

consolidated statement of cash flow highlights in thousands year ended september  operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities was million during fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a net increase of million 
this net increase was due to an increase in net income of million  deferred income taxes of million  inventory obsolescence of million  net increases in working capital of million and other non cash items of million 
this was offset by net decreases in amortization expense of million 
changes in working capital increased cash flows by million due to a million increase in accounts receivable as the increase in accounts receivable in fiscal was less than the increase in fiscal and a million increase in inventories as inventories have declined in fiscal this was offset by a million net decrease in accounts payable and million in other assets and accrued expenses 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources continued net cash provided by operating activities was million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal  a net increase of million 
this net increase is due to an increase in net income of million and a net increase of million of other non cash items  offset by a decrease of million for changes in deferred income tax benefits and a million decrease due to changes in working capital 
changes in working capital decreased cash flows by million primarily due to an million decrease in accounts receivable as the receivables balance increased due to higher revenue in september than in september inventory levels were approximately the same at september  and  however inventories decreased million at september  compared to this was offset by a net increase of million related to changes in accounts payable and a net increase of million related to changes in other assets and accrued expenses 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  a net increase of million 
we used an additional million of cash for net purchases of marketable securities in fiscal compared to fiscal  offset by million fewer capital expenditures in fiscal as compared to fiscal net cash used by investing activities was million in fiscal as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million during fiscal  a net decrease of million 
net purchases of marketable securities in fiscal offset by net settlements of marketable securities in fiscal resulted in a net decrease of million 
we used cash of million for a deferred payment related to the spectrum acquisition in fiscal in fiscal we spent million related to the acquisition of the assets of mobiapps and reduced our capital expenditures by million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  resulting from additional exercises of stock options and employee stock purchase plan transactions 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal as compared to net cash used in financing activities of million in fiscal  a net increase of million 
we spent million related to treasury stock repurchases in fiscal in fiscal compared to fiscal  we received an additional million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan transactions and spent million less in capital lease payments 
we expect positive cash flows from operations and believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances  cash generated from operations and our ability to secure debt and or equity financing will be sufficient to fund our business operations and capital expenditures for the next twelve months and beyond 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at september  payments due by fiscal period less than in thousands total year years years thereafter operating leases 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources continued the operating lease agreements included above primarily relate to office space 
the table above does not include possible payments for uncertain tax positions 
our reserve for uncertain tax positions  including accrued interest and penalties  was million as of september  due to the nature of the underlying liabilities and the extended time often needed to resolve income tax uncertainties  we cannot make reliable estimates of the amount or timing of future cash payments that may be required to settle these liabilities 
the above table also does not include our obligation for royalties under a license agreement that we entered into september  as a result of the patent litigation settlement with mosaid technologies incorporated 
the royalties are calculated based on future sales of licensed products identified in the settlement agreement and we cannot make reliable estimates of the amount of cash payments 
foreign currency we are exposed to foreign currency risk associated with certain sales transactions being denominated in euros  british pounds  japanese yen and indian rupees and foreign currency translation risk as the financial position and operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars for consolidation 
we have not implemented a formal hedging strategy to reduce foreign currency risk 
during  we had approximately million of net sales related to foreign customers including export sales  of which million was denominated in foreign currency  predominantly the euro and british pound 
during both and  we had approximately million of net sales to foreign customers including export sales  of which million and million  respectively  were denominated in foreign currency  predominantly the euro and british pound 
in future periods  we expect a significant portion of sales will continue to be made in euros and british pounds 
recent accounting developments in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
this guidance provides an update on how an entity tests goodwill for impairment 
this revised guidance allows companies an option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment 
under the revised guidance  a company is permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether goodwill impairment exists prior to performing analyses comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount 
if  based on the qualitative assessment  a company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  quantitative testing for impairment is not necessary 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
we have elected to early adopt this update to be effective for our fiscal year beginning october  and we do not expect that the adoption of this update will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
this guidance eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the consolidated statement of stockholders equity 
rather it requires that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this guidance also requires us to present on the face of the financial statements any reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we will adopt this guidance beginning with our fiscal quarter ending december  the adoption of this guidance will have no effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations  as it will only impact how certain information related to other comprehensive income is presented in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued recent accounting developments continued in may  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 fair value measurements topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
this guidance changes the wording used to describe many of the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements to ensure consistency between us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
this guidance is to be applied prospectively and is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december  we will adopt this guidance beginning with our fiscal quarter ending march  we do not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the values of purchased assets and assumed liabilities in acquisitions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies impact our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues are derived primarily from the sale of embedded and non embedded products to our distributors and direct end user oem customers  and to a small extent from the sale of professional and engineering services  fees associated with technical support  training  software licenses and royalties 
we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured and there are no post delivery obligations other than warranty 
under these criteria  product revenue is generally is recognized upon shipment of product to customers  including direct end user oem and distributors 
sales to authorized domestic distributors and direct oems are made with certain rights of return and price adjustment provisions 
estimated reserves for future returns and pricing adjustments are established by us based on an analysis of historical patterns of returns and price adjustments as well as an analysis of authorized returns compared to received returns  current on hand inventory at distributors  and distribution sales for the current period 
estimated reserves for future returns and price adjustments are charged against revenues in the same period as the corresponding sales are recorded 
material differences between the historical trends used to determine estimated reserves and actual returns and pricing adjustments could result in a material change to our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
we have applied consistent methodologies for estimating reserves for future returns and pricing adjustments for all years presented 
the reserve for future returns and pricing adjustments was million at september  and million at september  
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our non product revenue represented  and of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
the majority of the non product revenue was from professional and engineering services and represented  and of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
we also had revenue from cloud based services  post contract customer support  fees associated with technical support  training  royalties and the sale of software licenses 
our software development tools and development boards often include multiple elements  including hardware  software licenses  post contract customer support  limited training and basic hardware design review 
our customers purchase these products and services during their product development process in which they use the tools to build network connectivity into the devices they are manufacturing 
revenue for professional and engineering services and training is recognized upon performance 
revenue from software licenses is recognized when earned 
revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements are recognized as each element is earned based on the relative fair value of each element provided the delivered elements have value to customers on a standalone basis 
amounts allocated to each element are based on its vendor specific objective evidence  such as the sales price for the product or service when it is sold separately 
revenue from cloud based services is earned in two ways a web based management fees are considered to be earned on a monthly basis consistent with a monthly contractual commitment  and b transaction fees that are billed to the customer at the larger of the minimum price or the number of transactions times the stated fee and are considered earned as the transactions occur 
cash equivalents and marketable securities we regularly monitor and evaluate the realizable value of our marketable securities 
when assessing marketable securities for other than temporary declines in value  we consider several factors 
these factors include how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost  how long the market value of the investment has been less than its original cost  the underlying factors contributing to a decline in the prices of securities in a single asset class  the performance of the issuer s stock price in relation to the stock price of its competitors within the industry  expected market volatility  analyst recommendations  the views of external investment managers  any news or financial information that has been released specific to the investee and the outlook for the overall industry in which the issuer operates 
if events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the value of these securities has occurred and is other than temporary  we would record a charge to other income expense 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts  which reflects the estimate of losses that may result from the inability of some of our customers to make required payments 
the estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on known circumstances regarding collectability of customer accounts and historical collections experience 
if the financial condition of one or more of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
material differences between the historical trends used to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts and actual collection experience could result in a material change to our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million at september  and million at september  
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and estimates continued inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or fair market value  with cost determined using the first in  first out method 
we reduce the carrying value of our inventories for estimated excess and obsolete inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future product demand and market conditions
