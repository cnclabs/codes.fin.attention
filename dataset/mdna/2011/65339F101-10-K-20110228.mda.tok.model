item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion should be read in conjunction with the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein 
in the discussion of results of operations below  all comparisons are with the corresponding items in the prior year 
overview nextera energy is one of the nation largest providers of electricity related services 
it has two principal operating subsidiaries  fpl and nextera energy resources 
fpl  a rate regulated utility  serves more than million people throughout most of the east and lower west coasts of florida 
nextera energy resources  nextera energy competitive energy subsidiary  produces electricity primarily using wind  natural gas and nuclear resources 
together  fpl and nextera energy resources generating assets represented approximately  mw of capacity at december  see item generating facilities 
corporate and other  discussed below  includes fpl fibernet  which provides fiber optic services to fpl  telecommunications companies and other custome rs throughout florida  and lone star  a rate regulated utility in texas 
fpl obtains its operating revenues primarily from the sale of electricity to retail customers at rates established by the fpsc through base rates and cost recovery clause mechanisms 
effective march   pursuant to the fpsc rate order  new retail base rates for fpl were established  resulting in an increase in retail base revenues of approximately million on an annualized basis 
the fpsc rate order also established a regulatory roe of with a range of plus or minus basis points and an adjusted regulatory equity ratio of  and shifted certain costs from retail base rates to the capacity clause 
in addition  the fpsc rate order directed fpl to reduce depreciation expense surplus depreciation credit over the to period related to a depreciation reserve surplus of app roximately million 
subsequently  the principal parties in fpl s rate case signed the rate agreement and  on february   the fpsc issued a final order reflecting its decision to approve the rate agreement 
key elements of the rate agreement  which will be effective through december   are as follows subject to the provisions of the rate agreement  retail base rates will be effectively frozen through the end of incremental cost recovery through fpl s capacity clause for wcec unit no 
 which is expected to be placed in service by mid  will be permitted up to the amount of the projected fuel savings for customers during the term of the rate agreement 
see item fpl operations fossil operations 
future storm restoration costs would be recoverable on an accelerated basis beginning days from the filing of a cost recovery petition  but capped at an amount that produces a surcharge of no more than for every  kwh of usage on residential bills during the first months of cost recovery 
any additional costs would be eligible for recovery in subsequent years 
if storm restoration costs exceed million in any given calendar year  fpl may request an increase to the surcharge for the amount above million 
if fpl earned regulatory roe falls below  fpl may seek retail base rate relief 
if fpl earned regulatory roe rises above  any party to the rate agreement may seek a reduction in fpl s retail base rates 
in determining the regulatory roe for all purposes under the rate agreement  earnings will be calculated on an actual  non weather adjusted basis 
fpl can vary the amount of surplus depreciation credit taken in any calendar year up to a cap in of million  a cap in subsequent years of million plus the amount of any unused portion from prior years  and a cap of million surplus depreciation credit cap over the course of the rate agreement  provided that in any year of the rate agreement  including  fpl must use at least enough surplus depreciation credit to maintain a earned regulatory roe but may not use any amount of surplus depreciation credit that would result in an earned regulatory roe in excess of 
as of december   approximately million of the surplus depreciation credit cap remains 
nextera energy and fpl financial statements in item reflect the effects of the fpsc rate order and the rate agreement 
under the terms of the rate agreement  which was in effect from january  through february   retail base rates did not increase except to allow recovery of the revenue requirements of fpl s three power plants that achieved commercial operation during the term of the rate agreement turkey point unit no 
in and wcec units nos 
and in under the terms of the rate agreement  fpl electric property depreciation rates were based upon the comprehensive depreciation studies it filed with the fpsc in march  however  fpl reduced depreciation on its plant in service by million each year as allowed by the rate agreement 
the rate agreement also provided for a revenue sharing mechanism  whereby revenues from retail base ope rations in excess of certain thresholds would be shared with customers 
during the term of the rate agreement  fpl revenues did not exceed the thresholds 
in  fpl retail customer growth was  compared to a decline in customers in and a increase in positive customer growth is projected to continue in  although the rate of growth is projected to be below fpl s average rate of over the last years 
non weather related usage per retail customer began to decline in the mid s and this decline intensified in the to period 
the rate of decline in non weather related usage per retail customer moderated in inactive accounts accounts with installed meters without corresponding customer names and low usage customers customers using less than kwh per month began to increase in and peaked in at december   inactive accounts were approximately less than they had been at december  while the number of low usage customers was higher than they were at december  fpl believes that the economic slowdown and the downturn in the housing market that have affected the country and the state of florida have contributed to the slowdown in customer growth and to the decline in non weather related usage per retail customer 
a portion of the decline in non weather related usage per retail customer may also be related to federal and state mandated energy efficiency measures 
the unemployment rate in florida was and in december and  respectively  and was as high as in early fpl is unable to predict whether or when growth in customers and non weather related customer usage might return to previous trends 
nextera energy resources is in the competitive energy business with the majority of its operating revenues derived from wholesale electricity sales 
nextera energy resources strategy is  among other things  to continue to maintain its leadership position in wind  accelerate growth in solar development  continue to expand its transmission capability  grow its customer supply and proprietary power and gas trading businesses  and develop its natural gas infrastructure business 
nextera energy resources customer supply business includes full energy and capacity requirements services and the operations of a retail electricity provider 
nextera energy resources seeks to expand its generation portfolio primarily through wind and solar development and acquisitions where economic prospects are attractive 
 nextera energy resources plans to add approximately  mw to  mw of new wind generation in to  including mw added in and approximately mw to  mw in in addition to wind expansion  nextera energy resources is considering several solar development opportunities in the united states and europe  and plans to add approximately mw to mw of new solar generation in through  including mw added in the wind and solar expansions are subject to  among other things  continued public policy support  support for the construction and availability of sufficient transmission facilities and capacity  continued market demand  supply chain expansion and access to capital at reasonable cost and on reasonable terms 
nextera energy resources continues to invest in natural gas infrastructure opportunities 
nextera energy resources is evaluating additional natural gas infrastructure opportunities and will continue to explore additional projects as opportunities that it believes will be economically attractive become available 
nextera energy resources market is diversified by region as well as by fuel source 
see item generating facilities 
nextera energy resources sells a large percentage of its expected output to hedge against price volatility 
consequently  if nextera energy resources plants do not perform as expected  nextera energy resources could be required to purchase power at potentially higher market prices to meet its contractual obligations 
nextera energy resources energy marketing and trading business is focused primarily on managing commodity price risk and extracting maximum value from its assets 
the us congress  the epa and certain states and regions continue to consider several legislative and regulatory proposals with respect to ghg emissions 
the economic and operational impact of any legislation and or regulation on nextera energy and fpl depends on a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  the allowed emissions  whether emission allowances will be allocated or auctioned  the cost to reduce emissions or buy allowances in the marketplace and the availability of offsets and mitigating factors to moderate the costs of compliance 
if and until legislation is enacted and implementing regulations are adopted  the economic and operational impact either positive or negative on nextera energy and fpl cannot be determined  but could be material 
in the case of fpl  increased costs ass ociated with compliance with new environmental regulations are generally recoverable from customers  while the recovery of such increased costs for nextera energy resources would depend on market prices for electricity 
see item environmental matters 
results of operations nextera energy and nextera energy resources segregate into two categories unrealized mark to market gains and losses on energy derivative transactions which are used to manage commodity price risk 
the first category  referred to as trading activities  represents the net unrealized effect of actively traded positions entered into to take advantage of market price movements and to optimize the value of generation assets and related contracts 
the second category  referred to as non qualifying hedges  represents the net unrealized effect of derivative and certain other transactions entered into as economic hedges but which do not qualify for hedge accounting  or hedge accounting was not elected  and the ineffective portion of transactions accounted for as cash flow hedges 
in january  nextera energy discontinued hedge accounting for its cash flow hedges related to energy contract derivative instruments  which could result in increased volatility in the non qualifying hedge category 
at fpl  substantially all changes in the fair value of energy derivative transactions are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled  and  upon settlement  any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause or the capacity clause 
see note nextera energy management uses earnings excluding certain items adjusted earnings internally for financial planning  for analysis of performance  for reporting of results to the board of directors and as an input in determining whether performance goals are met for performance based compensation under nextera energy employee incentive compensation plans 
nextera energy also uses adjusted earnings when communicating its financial results and earnings outlook to investors 
adjusted earnings exclude the unrealized mark to market effect of non qualifying hedges and other than temporary impairment otti losses on securities held in nextera energy resources nuclear decommissioning funds  net of the reversal of previously recognized otti losses on securities sold and losses on securities where price recovery was deemed unlikely collectively  otti reversals 
nextera energy management believes adjusted earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the company fundamental earnings power 
although the excluded amounts are properly included in the determination of net income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  management believes that the amount and or nature of such items make period to period comparisons of operations difficult and potentially confusing 
adjusted earnings do not represent a substitute for net income  as prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
summary presented below is a summary of net income by reportable segment see note 
beginning in  nextera energy resources results reflect an allocation of interest expense from capital holdings to nextera energy resources based on a deemed capital structure of debt and allocated shared service costs 
nextera energy other reportable segment  fpl  a rate regulated utility  was not affected by these changes 
prior year segment data of nextera energy resources and corporate and other has been restated to include the effect of these changes 
corporate and other represents other business activities  other segments that are not separately reportable and eliminating entries 
years ended december  millions fpl nextera energy resources corporate and other nextera energy consolidated the increase in fpl results reflects higher retail customer usage of  retail base rate increases resulting from the placement in service of wcec units nos 
and in  the impact of the fpsc rate order and higher cost recovery clause results  partly offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense recovered through base rates  higher o m  property tax and interest expenses and lower afudc equity 
the increase compared to the prior year period in retail customer usage reflects colder weather in the first quarter and warmer weather in the second and third quarters  and other factors  partly offset by lower usage in the fourth quarter 
fpl results reflects retail base rate increases resulting from the placement in service of wcec units nos 
and  higher afudc equity on the wcec units  a increase in usage per retail customer reflecting favorable weather conditions partly offset by other factors  and higher cost recovery clause results partly offset by higher o m and depreciation and amortization expenses recovered through base rates 
nextera energy resources results for and were affected by net unrealized after tax gains and losses from non qualifying hedges  after tax otti losses on securities held in its nuclear decommissioning funds and after tax otti reversals 
see table below for details of such gains  losses and reversals  all of which are included in nextera energy and nextera energy resources net income 
years ended december  millions net unrealized mark to market after tax gains losses from non qualifying hedge activity otti after tax losses on securities held in nuclear decommissioning funds otti after tax reversals the change in unrealized mark to market activity from non qualifying hedges is primarily attributable to changes in forward power and natural gas prices  as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized mark to market gains or losses as the underlying transactions were realized 
as a general rule  a gain loss in the non qualifying hedge category is offset by decreases increases in the fair value of related physical asset positions in the portfolio or contracts  which are not marked to market under generally accepted accounting principles 
nextera energy resources results for also reflect higher earnings from the existing asset portfolio  earnings from new investments and higher gas infrastructure results 
these results were partially offset by lower results from the customer supply and proprietary power and gas trading businesses  the absence of a tax benefit recorded in reflecting the reduction of previously deferred income taxes resulting from an additional equity investment in canadian operations foreign tax benefit  the absence of a tax benefit recorded in related to a change in state tax law that extended the carry forward period of itcs on certain wind projects state tax benefit  a writedown of the value of certain assets associated with plans to repower two california wind facilities and higher expenses to support the growth of the business 
nextera energy resources results also reflect increased earnings from new investments and the customer supply and proprietary power and gas trading businesses  partly offset by lower earnings from the existing asset portfolio  reflecting the negative impacts of weather and higher expenses to support the growth in the business 
see footnote a to the table under nextera energy resources below for a description of projects included in new investments and the existing asset portfolio 
results for corporate and other in reflect higher consolidating income tax benefits  including a one time benefit of million related to deferred income taxes  and higher interest income  partly offset by higher interest expense 
results for corporate and other in reflect higher interest income and realized and unrealized gains on investments  partly offset by lower consolidating income tax adjustments and higher interest expense 
nextera energy effective income tax rate for all periods presented reflects ptcs for wind projects at nextera energy resources and  for and  deferred tax benefits associated with grants convertible itcs under the recovery act 
ptcs and deferred tax benefits associated with convertible itcs can significantly affect nextera energy effective income tax rate depending on the amount of pretax income 
ptcs can be significantly affected by wind generation 
see note income taxes and sale of differential membership interests and note fpl fpl net income for  and was million  million and million  respectively  an increase in of million and an increase in of million 
see summary above for a discussion of the major drivers of these increases 
see overview for a discussion of fpsc rate matters 
fpl operating revenues consisted of the following years ended december  millions retail base fuel cost recovery net repayment of previously deferred retail fuel revenues net deferral of retail fuel revenues other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs  net of any deferrals other  primarily pole attachment rentals  transmission and wholesale sales and customer related fees total for the year ended december   a increase in the average number of customer accounts increased retail base revenues by approximately million  while a increase in usage per retail customer  reflecting cold weather experienced in the first quarter and warmer weather in the second and third quarters and other factors partly offset by lower usage in the fourth quarter  increased retail base revenues by approximately million 
base rate increases resulting from two wcec units commencing commercial operation in august and november and the base rate increase pursuant to the fpsc rate order increased retail base revenues for the year ended december  by approximately million and million  respectively 
see overview for a discussion of fpl customer growth and non wea ther related usage 
for the year ended december   a decrease in the average number of customer accounts reduced retail base revenues by approximately million while a increase in usage per retail customer  reflecting favorable weather conditions partly offset by other factors  increased retail base revenues by approximately million 
customer usage in reflects one less day of sales in  as was a leap year 
base rate increases resulting from the two wcec units commencing commercial operation in increased retail base revenues by approximately million 
revenues from fuel and other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs  such as franchise fees  revenue taxes and storm related surcharges  are largely a pass through of costs 
such revenues also include a return allowed to be recovered through the cost recovery clauses on certain assets  primarily related to solar  environmental and nuclear capacity projects 
in  and  cost recovery clauses contributed million  million and million  respectively  to fpl net income 
the increase in and cost recovery clause results is primarily due to a return related to additional solar  environmental and nuclear capacity expenditures  partly offset in by lower interest earned on fuel clause underrecoveries 
in  it is expected that cost recovery clauses will contribute higher earnings for fpl as a result of additional nuclear capacity and environmental expenditures 
underrecovery or overrecovery of such cost recovery clause and pass through costs can significantly affect nextera energy and fpl operating cash flows 
fluctuations in fuel cost recovery revenues are primarily driven by changes in fuel and energy charges which are included in fuel  purchased power and interchange expense in the consolidated statements of income  as well as by changes in energy sales 
fluctuations in revenues from other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs are primarily driven by changes in storm related surcharges  capacity charges  franchise fee costs  the impact of changes in o m and depreciation expenses on the underlying cost recovery clause  investment in solar and environmental projects  investment in nuclear capacity until such capacity goes into service  pre construction costs associated with the development of two additional n uclear units at the turkey point site and changes in energy sales 
capacity charges and franchise fee costs are included in fuel  purchased power and interchange and taxes other than income taxes and other  respectively  in the consolidated statements of income 
fpl uses a risk management fuel procurement program which was approved by the fpsc 
the fpsc reviews the program activities and results for prudence on an annual basis as part of its annual review of fuel costs 
the program is intended to manage fuel price volatility by locking in fuel prices for a portion of fpl fuel requirements 
the current regulatory asset for the change in fair value of derivative instruments used in the fuel procurement program amounted to approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
pursuant to an fpsc order  fpl was required to refund in the form of a one time credit to retail customers bills the year end estimated fuel overrecovery  during the first quarter of  approximately million was refunded to re tail customers 
at december   approximately million of retail fuel revenues were overrecovered  the reversal of which is reflected in the net repayment of previously deferred retail fuel revenues caption included in the table above 
the difference between the refund and the december  overrecovery will be collected from retail customers after the decrease in fuel revenues in reflects the million refund and approximately  million related to a lower average fuel factor  partly offset by million attributable to higher energy sales 
the decrease in fuel revenues in reflects approximately million related to a lower average fuel factor and million attributable to lower energy sales 
the decrease from december  to december  in deferred clause and franchise revenues and the increase in deferred clause and franchise expenses current and noncurrent  collectively on ne xtera energy and fpl consolidated balance sheets totaled approximately million and negatively affected nextera energy and fpl cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december  the decrease in revenues from other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs in is primarily due to lower revenues associated with the fpsc nuclear cost recovery rule and lower revenues related to franchise and revenue taxes  partly offset by higher environmental clause revenues 
the increase in revenues from other cost recovery clauses and pass through costs in is primarily due to additional revenues associated with the fpsc nuclear cost recovery rule and higher conservation and environmental clause revenues 
the fpsc nuclear cost recovery rule provides for the recovery of prudently incurred pre construction costs and carrying charges equal to a pretax afudc rate on construction costs for new nuclear capacity through levelized charges under the capacity clause 
in  fpl began recovering pre construction costs associated with the development of two additional nuclear units at the turkey point site and carrying charges equal to a pretax afudc rate on construction costs associated with the addition of approximately mw to mw of capacity at its existing nuclear units 
the same rule provides for the recovery of construction costs  once property related to the new nuclear capacity goes into service  through a base rate increase 
the decline in in revenues associated with the nuclear cost recovery rule is primarily due to lower spending related to the development of the two additional nuclear units at the turkey point site 
the decline in revenues related to franchise and revenue taxes reflects the decline in fuel revenues 
the major components of fpl fuel  purchased power and interchange expense are as follows years ended december  millions fuel and energy charges during the period net collection of previously deferred retail fuel costs net deferral of retail fuel costs other  primarily capacity charges  net of any capacity deferral total the decrease in fuel and energy charges in reflects lower fuel and energy prices of approximately million  partly offset by approximately million attributable to higher energy sales 
the decrease in fuel and energy charges in was due to lower fuel and energy prices 
fpl o m expenses increased million in reflecting an approximately million charge for workforce reductions and higher nuclear and fossil generation  distribution  transmission and nuclear insurance costs of approximately million  million  million  million and million  respectively  partly offset by lower customer service costs  primarily due to lower uncollectible accounts  of million 
the increase in nuclear generation costs is primarily due to higher maintenance costs and reflects a reimbursement in of prior years costs of approximately million related to a spent nuclear fuel litigation settlement agreement with the us government 
the increase in fossil generation costs is primarily related to wcec units nos 
and  which units were placed in se rvice in the second half of  and higher plant overhaul costs 
the increase in distribution and transmission costs reflects higher restoration and tree trimming costs 
other changes in o m expenses were primarily driven by pass through costs which did not significantly affect net income 
fpl o m expenses increased million in reflecting higher insurance and employee benefit costs of approximately million and million  respectively  partly offset by lower distribution  nuclear and fossil generation costs of million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in insurance costs is primarily due to the absence of a refund associated with an environmental insurance policy termination  which occurred in  as well as higher nuclear insurance costs 
the increase in employee benefit costs is primarily due to higher medical costs  a lower pension credit and other costs driven by market conditions 
the decrease in distribution costs reflects deferred projects and productivity improvements 
the decline in nuclear generation costs reflects a rei mbursement of prior years costs related to the spent fuel settlement agreement and lower costs related to plant improvement initiatives partly offset by higher refueling and maintenance outage costs 
the decline in fossil generation costs is primarily due to lower overhaul costs  partly offset by additional costs related to wcec units nos 
and other changes in o m expenses were primarily driven by pass through costs which did not significantly affect net income 
the major components of fpl depreciation and amortization expense are as follows years ended december  millions million annual reduction under the rate agreement surplus depreciation credit recorded under the rate agreement other depreciation and amortization recovered under base rates depreciation and amortization recovered under cost recovery clauses total fpl had been recording the million annual reduction in depreciation and amortization expense since  as approved by the fpsc in previous rate orders 
see overview regarding the amount of surplus depreciation credit that fpl may record over the term of the rate agreement 
the decline in other depreciation and amortization expense recovered under base rates in is primarily due to lower depreciation rates as a result of the fpsc rate order  partly offset by higher plant in service balances related to wcec units nos 
and  which were placed in service in august and november  respectively 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense recovered under base rates in is primarily due to higher depreciation on transmission and distribution facilities  as well as wcec units nos 
and depreciation and amortization recorded under cost recovery clauses in and reflects changes in the amortization of pre construction costs associated with fpl planned nuclear units recovered under the nuclear cost recovery rule 
see note electric plant  depreciation and amortization 
taxes other than income taxes and other decreased million in and increased million in primarily due to changes in franchise fees and revenue taxes  which are pass through costs 
in addition  taxes other than income taxes and other in and reflect higher property taxes of million and million  respectively  due to growth in plant in service balances and  for  a higher property tax rate 
the increase in interest expense in is primarily due to higher average debt balances  as well as lower afudc debt 
the decrease in interest expense in reflects a decline in average interest rates of approximately basis points and higher afudc debt  partly offset by higher average debt balances 
see afudc equity below for explanation of the change in afudc debt 
interest expense on storm recovery bonds  as well as certain other interest expense collectively  clause interest  are essentially pass through amounts and do not significantly affect net income  as the clause interest is recovered either under cost recovery clause mechanisms or through a storm recovery bond surcharge 
clause interest for  and amounted to approximately million  millio n and million  respectively 
the increase in clause interest in is primarily due to higher interest associated with solar  environmental and nuclear capacity expenditures 
the decrease in afudc equity in is primarily attributable to wcec units nos 
and  which units commenced commercial operation in  partly offset by additional afudc equity on wcec unit no 
the decrease in afudc equity also reflects a decline  effective april   in the afudc rate from to  as approved by the fpsc 
the increase in afudc equity in is primarily attributable to additional afudc equity on wcec unit nos 
 and fpl currently faces competition from other suppliers of electrical energy to wholesale customers and from alternative energy sources and self generation for other customer groups  primarily industrial customers 
the ferc has jurisdiction over potential changes that could affect competition in wholesale transactions 
in  operating revenues from wholesale and industrial customers combined represented approximately of fpl total operating revenues 
various states  other than florida  have enacted legislation or have state commissions that have issued orders designed to allow retail customers to choose their electricity supplier 
management believes it is unlikely there will be any state actions to restructure the retail electric industry in florida in the near future 
if the basis of regulation for some or all of fpl business changes from cost based regulation  existing regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless regulators specify an alternative means of recovery or refund 
further  other aspects of the business  such as generation assets and long term power purchase commitments  would need to be reviewed to assess their recoverability in a changed regulatory environment 
see critical accounting policies and estimates regulatory accounting 
fpl is currently constructing wcec unit no 
 a natural gas fired combined cycle unit of approximately  mw  which is expected to be placed in service by mid in addition  fpl is in the process of adding approximately mw to mw of capacity at its existing nuclear units at st 
lucie and turkey point  which additional capacity is projected to be placed in service from spring to fpl is also in the process of modernizing its cape canaveral and riviera beach power plants to high efficiency natural gas fired units and expects the units to be placed in service by and  respectively 
each modernized plant is expected to provide approximately  mw of capacity 
a mw solar pv facility in brevard county  florida was placed in service in april and a mw solar thermal facility in martin county  florida was placed in service in december nextera energy resources nextera energy resources and segment results have been restated to reflect a change in the method of allocating non utility interest expense and the allocation of shared service costs 
see summary above and note for additional discussion 
nextera energy resources net income for  and was million  million and million  respectively  an increase in of million and a decrease in of million 
the primary drivers  on an after tax basis  of these changes were as follows increase decrease from prior period years ended december  millions new investments a existing assets a gas infrastructure customer supply and proprietary power and gas trading businesses asset sales interest expense  differential membership costs and other change in unrealized mark to market non qualifying hedge activity b c change in otti losses on securities held in nuclear decommissioning funds  net of otti reversals c net income increase decrease a includes ptcs and itcs on wind projects and itcs on solar projects and  for new investments  deferred tax benefits associated with convertible itcs see note electric plant  depreciation and amortization  note income taxes and note but does not include allocation of interest expense or corporate general and administrative expenses 
results from new projects are included in new investments during the first twelve months of operation 
a project results are included in existing assets beginning with the thirteenth month of operation 
b see note and discussion above related to derivative instruments 
c see table in summary above for additional detail 
the increase in nextera energy resources results from new investments reflects the addition of over  mw of wind generation during or after and a benefit related to state itcs 
the increase in nextera energy resources results from new investments reflects the addition of over  mw of wind generation during or after results from new investments for the years ended december  and include approximately million and million  respectively  of deferred tax benefits associated with convertible itcs 
in  results from nextera energy resources existing asset portfolio increased primarily due to favorable results at seabrook of approximately million resulting primarily from the absence of an extended outage in in addition  results from the existing asset portfolio reflects favorable generation due to lower curtailments and a higher wind resource across the wind portfolio totaling approximately million 
these results were partially offset by unfavorable market conditions in the ercot market affecting nextera energy resources merchant gas assets totaling approximately million and the absence of the state tax benefit of million 
in  results from nextera energy resources existing asset portfolio decreased approximately million primarily due to unfavorable resul ts in the ercot and nepool markets due primarily to unfavorable market conditions  lower results of million associated with existing wind projects primarily due to a lower wind resource across the portfolio and lower results of million from the contracted portfolio  partly offset by the state tax benefit and favorable results at seabrook primarily due to higher prices 
the increase in gas infrastructure results in is primarily due to exiting the hedged positions on a small number of future drilling opportunities 
results from the customer supply and proprietary power and gas trading businesses decreased in primarily due to lower power and gas trading results  partly offset by a gain from the sale of a power supply contract that nextera energy resources entered into in the increase in is due to higher power and gas trading results and favorable residential sales margins from the retail electricity provider 
asset sales in include an after tax gain of approximately million on the sale of a coal fired project and an after tax gain on a waste to energy project of approximately million recorded in after the expiration of an option for the buyer to sell the project back to nextera energy resources 
asset sales in include after tax gains of million for the sale of wind development rights  million for the sale of a mw wind project and million for the sale of an interest in the waste to energy project while asset sales in reflect a million after tax gain on the sale of development rights on a natural gas project 
in both and  interest expense  differential membership costs and other reflects higher interest and other costs due to growth of the business and  for  also reflects an after tax writedown of approximately million in the value of certain assets associated with the plans to repower two california wind facilities and the absence of the foreign tax benefit of million which was recorded in in  the foreign tax benefit was offset by other income tax expenses in and the absence of other income tax benefits recorded in the prior year 
operating revenues for the year ended december  increased million primarily due to higher revenues at pmi and nextera energy resources retail electricity provider collectively  approximately million  project additions million  higher gas infrastructure revenues of million  higher revenues in the existing asset portfolio of million primarily due to the absence of an extended outage in at seabrook  favorable generation due to lower curtailments and a higher wind resource across the wind portfolio 
in addition  operating revenues increased due to losses of million on unrealized mark to market non qualifying hedge activity compared to million of such losses in operating revenues for the year ended december  decreased million primarily due to losses of million on unrealized mark to market non qualifying hedge activity in compared to gains on such hedges of million in excluding this mark to market activity  revenues were affected by unfavorable market conditions in the nepool  ercot and pjm markets and an unfavorable wind resource  partly offset by higher operating revenues at pmi and nextera energy resources retail electricity provider collectively  approximately million and project additions million 
operating expenses for the year ended december  increased million reflecting higher fuel costs of approximately million  higher costs for project additions of approximately million and higher other operating expenses of million 
other operating expenses increased due to higher maintenance activities  a write down in the value of certain assets associated with the plans to repower two california wind facilities and additional wells in gas infrastructure 
this was partially offset by million of unrealized mark to market gains from non qualifying hedges compared to million of such gains in operating expenses for the year ended december  decreased million primarily due to lower fuel costs of approximately million partially offset by proj ect additions of million and higher corporate general and administrative expenses of million to support the growth in the business 
in addition  operating expenses reflect million of unrealized mark to market gains from non qualifying hedges compared to million of such gains in nextera energy resources interest expense for the year ended december  and increased million and million  respectively  primarily due to increased borrowings to support the growth of the business  partly offset by lower average interest rates of approximately basis points and basis points  respectively 
gains on disposal of assets net in nextera energy consolidated statements of income for the year ended december   and reflect million  million and million  respectively  of gains on sales of securities held in nextera energy resources nuclear decommissioning funds 
in addition  gains on disposal of assets net for the year ended december  reflect a pretax gain of million on the sale of the waste to energy proje ct and for the year ended december  reflect an approximately million pretax gain on the sale of development rights related to a natural gas project 
ptcs from nextera energy resources wind projects are reflected in nextera energy resources earnings 
ptcs are recognized as wind energy is generated and sold based on a per kwh rate prescribed in applicable federal and state statutes  and were approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  nextera energy effective income tax rate for the years ended december  and was affected by deferred tax benefits associated with convertible itcs of million and million  respectively 
see note nextera energy resources expects its future portfolio capacity growth to come primarily from wind and solar development and from asset acquisitions 
nextera energy resources plans to add approximately  mw to  mw of new wind generation in to  including mw added in and approximately mw to  mw in in addition to wind expansion  nextera energy resources is considering several solar development opportunities in the united states and europe  and plans to add approximately mw to mw of new solar generation during the period through  including mw added in the wind and solar expansions are subject to  among other things  continued public policy support  support for the construction and availability of sufficient transmission facilities and capa city  continued market demand  supply chain expansion and access to capital at reasonable cost and on reasonable terms 
currently  in the united states  approximately states and the district of columbia have rps requiring electricity providers in the state or district to meet a certain percentage of their retail sales with energy from renewable sources 
these standards vary  but the majority include requirements to meet to of the electricity providers retail sales with energy from renewable sources by nextera energy resources believes that these standards will create incremental demand for renewable energy in the future 
competitive wholesale markets in the united states continue to evolve and vary among and within geographic regions 
revenues from electricity sales in these markets vary based on the prices obtainable for energy  capacity and other ancillary services 
some of the factors affecting success in these markets include the ability to operate generating assets efficiently and reliably  the price and supply of fuel  transmission constraints  wind  solar and hydro resources weather conditions  competition from regulated utilities and new sources of generation  effective risk management  demand growth  level of demand  environmental requirements and exposure to legal and regulatory changes 
expanded competition in a frequently changing regulatory environment presents both opportunities and risks for nextera energy resources 
opportunities exist for the selective acquisition of generation assets and for the construction and operation of efficient plants that can sell power in competitive markets 
nextera energy resources seeks to reduce its market risk by having a diversified portfolio by fuel type and location  as well as by contracting for the future sale of a significant amount of the electricity output of its plants 
the combination of new wind and solar projects and asset acquisitions are expected to be the key drivers supporting nextera energy resources growth over the next few years 
nextera energy resources earnings are subject to variability due to  among other things  operational performance  commodity price exposure  counterparty performance  weather conditions and project restructuring activities 
nextera energy resources exposure to commodity price risk is reduced by the degree of contract coverage obtained for and therefore  if nextera energy resources plants do not perform as expected  nextera energy resources could be required to purchase power at potentially higher market prices to meet its contractual obligations 
in addition to the effect of temperature  which is reflected in commodity prices and demand  changes in weather affect production levels of the wind portfolio as well as the hydro and solar units 
in managing its expos ure to commodity prices  nextera energy resources is dependent upon its counterparties to perform under their contractual obligations 
nextera energy resources actively manages the trade off between market risk and credit risk  as well as exposure with individual counterparties as a function of their creditworthiness 
as of december   substantially all of nextera energy resources contracted revenues are with investment grade counterparties 
corporate and other corporate and other is primarily comprised of interest expense  the operating results of fpl fibernet and other business activities  as well as corporate interest income and expenses 
corporate and other allocates non utility interest expense and shared service costs to nextera energy resources 
see summary above and note for a discussion regarding a change  beginning in  in the method of allocating non utility interest expense  the allocation of shared service costs and the restatement of the prior year segment results of corporate and other 
for purposes of allocating non utility interest expense  the deferred credit associated with differential membership interests sold by nextera energy resources subsid iaries is included with debt 
each subsidiary income taxes are calculated based on the separate return method  except that tax benefits that could not be used on a separate return basis  but are used on the consolidated tax return  are recorded by the subsidiary that generated the tax benefits 
any remaining consolidated income tax benefits or expenses are recorded at corporate and other 
the major components of corporate and other results  on an after tax basis  are as follows years ended december  millions interest expense  net of allocations to nextera energy resources interest income federal and state income tax benefits other net income the increase in interest expense in and reflects additional debt outstanding  partly offset by lower average interest rates of approximately basis points and basis points  respectively  and a higher allocation of interest costs to nextera energy resources 
the increase in interest income in and is primarily due to earnings on an energy related loan made to a third party by a capital holdings subsidiary 
the federal and state income tax benefits reflect consolidating income tax adjustments and  in  include a one time income tax benefit of million related to deferred income taxes 
other includes all other corporate income and expenses  as well as other business activities 
the decline in other in is primarily due to an million after tax loss on the s ale of assets held under leveraged leases  the pretax amount million of such loss is reflected in other net in nextera energy consolidated statements of income 
the increase in other in primarily reflects realized and unrealized gains on investments which are reflected in other net in the consolidated statements of income 
liquidity and capital resources nextera energy and its subsidiaries  including fpl  require funds to support and grow their businesses 
these funds are used for  among other things  working capital  capital expenditures  investments in or acquisitions of assets and businesses  payment of maturing debt obligations and  from time to time  redemption or repurchase of outstanding debt or equity securities 
it is anticipated that these requirements will be satisfied through a combination of internally generated funds  short and long term borrowings  and the issuance  from time to time  of short and long term debt and equity securities  consistent with nextera energy and fpl objective of maintaining  on a long term basis  a capital structure that will support a strong investment grade credit rating 
nextera energy  fpl and capital ho ldings rely on access to credit and capital markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements and other operations that are not satisfied by operating cash flows 
the inability of nextera energy  fpl and capital holdings to maintain their current credit ratings could affect their ability to raise short and long term capital  their cost of capital and the execution of their respective financing strategies  and could require the posting of additional collateral under certain agreements 
the global and domestic credit and capital markets experienced unprecedented levels of volatility and disruption in the recent past 
this significantly affected the cost and available sources of liquidity in the financial markets 
fpl and capital holdings have continued to have access to commercial paper and short and long term credit and capital markets 
if capital and credit market conditions change  this could alter spending plans and affect working capital at fpl and nextera energy resources 
available liquidity at december   nextera energy total net available liquidity was approximately billion  of which fpl portion was approximately billion 
the components of each company net available liquidity at december  were as follows maturity date fpl capital holdings nextera energy consoli dated fpl capital holdings millions bank revolving line of credit facilities a b b less letters of credit revolving credit facility less borrowings subtotal cash and cash equivalents less commercial paper net available liquidity a provide for the funding of loans up to  million  million for fpl and the issuance of letters of credit up to  million  million for fpl 
the entire amount of the credit facilities is available for general corporate purposes  including to provide back up liquidity for fpl and capital holdings commercial paper programs and other short term borrowings and to provide additional liquidity in the event of a loss to the companies or their subsidiaries operating facilities including  in the case of fpl  a transmission and distribution property loss 
fpl bank revolving line of credit facilities are also available to support the purchase of million of pollution control  solid waste disposal and industrial development revenue bonds tax exempt bonds in the event they are tendered by individual bond holders and not remarketed prior to maturity 
b million of fpl and million of capital holdings bank revolving line of credit facilities expire in the remaining portion of bank revolving line of credit facilities for fpl and capital holdings expires in as of february   banks participate in fpl and capital holdings bank revolving line of credit facilities and fpl revolving credit facility  with no one bank providing more than of the combined bank revolving line of credit facilities and fpl revolving credit facility 
pursuant to a guarantee agreement  nextera energy guarantees the payment of capital holdings debt obligations under the bank revolving line of credit facilities 
as a precondition for capital holdings to borrow or to issue letters of credit under the terms of its bank revolving line of credit facilities  among other things  nextera energy ratio of funded debt to total capitalization must not exceed a stated ratio 
the capital holdings bank revolving line of credit facilities also contain default and related acceleration provisions relating to  among other things  nextera energy ratio of funded debt to total capitalization exceeding the specified ratio 
similarly  as a precondition for fpl to borrow or to issue letters of credit under the terms of its bank revolving line of credit facilities and revolving credit facility  among other things  fpl ratio of funded debt to total capitalization must not exceed a stated ratio 
the fpl bank revolving line of credit facilities and revolving credit facility also contain default and related acceleration provisions relating to  among other things  fpl ratio of funded debt to total capitalization exceeding the specified ratio 
at december   each of nextera energy and fpl was in compliance with its required ratio 
in december  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of nextera energy resources the borrower entered into two canadian million  variable rate  three year bank revolving credit agreements that expire in both credit agreements can be extended for up to one additional year with the lenders consent 
under one of the credit agreements  if the borrower receives sufficient commitment offers from other interested lenders  the borrower may elect to increase the principal amount of credit available under the credit agreement to an amount not to exceed canadian million 
under both credit agreements  subject to satisfying certain preconditions  the borrower has the option at the end of the revolving credit term to convert any outstanding borrowings into a one year term loan 
borrowings under the credit agreements can be used for the borrower general corporate purposes  including the purchase  development  construction  and or operation of canadian electricity generating assets  including the repayment of debt assumed in connection with the purchase of such assets 
all borrowings under the credit agreements are guaranteed by capital holdings  which payment obligations are in turn guaranteed by nextera energy pursuant to the guarantee agreement with capital holdings 
as a precondition to borrow or issue letters of credit under the terms of the credit agreements  among other things  nextera energy ratio of funded debt to total capitalization must not exceed a stated ratio 
the credit agreements also contain default and related acceleration provisions relating to  among other things  nextera energy ratio of funded debt to total capitalization exceeding the specified ratio 
as of december   canadian million approximately us million had been borrowed under one of the credit agreements see cash flow below 
as of february   a total of canadian million approximately us million had been borrowed under the two credit agreements 
also  two indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of nextera energy resources have each established an million letter of credit facility 
one of the facilities expires in and serves as security for certain obligations of the subsidiary under commodity hedge agreements 
the other facility expires in and serves as security for certain obligations of the subsidiary under power purchase agreements 
in december  nextera energy completed the program it commenced in january under which it offered and sold  from time to time  nextera energy common stock having a gross sales price of up to million 
during and  nextera energy received gross proceeds through the sale and issuance of common stock under this program of approximately million and million  respectively 
at december   fpl had the capacity to absorb up to approximately million in future prudently incurred storm restoration costs without seeking recovery through a rate adjustment from the fpsc or filing a petition with the fpsc

the dodd frank act was enacted into law in july which  among other things  provides for the regulation of the otc derivatives market 
while the legislation is broad and detailed  substantial portions of the legislation require implementing rules to be adopted by federal governmental agencies including  but not limited to  the sec and the cftc 
the dodd frank act generally requires certain otc derivative transactions including asset backed otc derivatives used to hedge risks associated with commodity and interest rate exposure to be executed by certain types of entities through an exchange or to be centrally cleared 
however  the dodd frank act provides an exemption from mandatory clearing requirements for transactions entered into by non swap dealers or non major swap participants and other non financial entities  as defined in the dodd frank act  that are used to hedge or mitigate commercial risk 
the dodd frank act also includes provisions under which the cftc may impose capital and margin requirements on certain entities for transactions  including those that are used to hedge or mitigate commercial risk 
however  key legislators and regulators have indicated that it is not their intention to impose capital and margin requirements on counterparties that are eligible to use transactions to hedge or mitigate commercial risk 
final rules on otc derivative related provisions of the dodd frank act are required to be established through cftc and sec rulemakings within days after the date of enactment 
if  as a result of the rulemaking associated with the dodd frank act  fpl and nextera energy resources do not qualify for an exemption related to clearing and margining requirements  fpl and nextera energy resources would be subject to higher margin requirements 
it is possible that portions of nextera energy resources business may be subject to capital  reporting  recordkeeping and business conduct requirements and standards in addition to the already mentioned margin requirements 
depending on the outcome of these rules  system upgrades and business process modifications would likely be necessary to comply 
nextera energy and fpl cannot predict the final rules that will be adopted to implement the otc derivatives market provisions of the dodd frank act 
those rules could negatively affect nextera energy s and fpl s ability to hedge their commodity and interest rate risks  which could have a material adverse effect on nextera energy s and fpl s financial results 
the rules also could require nextera energy resources to restructure part of its energy marketing and trading operations or to discontinue certain portions of its business 
in addition  if the rules require nextera energy and fpl to post cash collateral with respect to swap transactions  nextera energy  s and fpl s liquidity could be materially adversely affected  and their ability to enter into otc derivatives to hedge commodity and interest rate risks could be significantly limited 
reporting and compliance requirements of the rules also could significantly increase operating costs and expose nextera energy and fpl to penalties for non compliance 
letters of credit  surety bonds and guarantees nextera energy and fpl obtain letters of credit and surety bonds  and issue guarantees to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties and financings 
at december   nextera energy had approximately million of standby letters of credit million for fpl  approximately million of surety bonds million for fpl and approximately billion notional amount of guarantees million for fpl  of which approximately billion million for fpl letters of credit and guarantees have expiration dates within the next five years 
an aggregate of approximately million million for fpl of the standby letters of credit at december  were issued under fpl s and capital holdings credit facilities 
see available liquidity above 
letters of credit  surety bonds and guarantees support  among other things  the buying and selling of wholesale energy commodities  debt and related reserves  nuclear activities  capital expenditures for wind development and other contractual agreements 
each of nextera energy and fpl believe it is unlikely that it would incur any liabilities associated with these letters of credit  surety bonds and guarantees 
accordingly  at december   nextera energy and fpl did not have any liabilities recorded for these letters of credit  surety bonds and guarantees 
in addition  nextera energy has guaranteed certain payment obligations of capital holdings  including most of its debt and all of its debentures and commercial paper issuances  as well as most of its payment guarantees  and capital holdings has guaranteed certain debt and other obligations of nextera energy resources and its subsidiaries 
see note commitments 
shelf registration in august  nextera energy  capital holdings  fpl and certain affiliated trusts filed a shelf registration statement with the sec for an unspecified amount of securities 
the amount of securities issuable by the companies is established from time to time by their respective boards of directors 
as of february   securities that may be issued under the registration statement  which became effective upon filing  include  depending on the registrant  senior debt securities  subordinated debt securities  junior subordinated debentures  first mortgage bonds  preferred trust securities  common stock  preferred stock  stock purchase contracts  stock purchase units  warrants and guarantees related to certain of those securities 
as of february   nextera energy and capital holdings had approximately billion issuable by either or both of them up to such aggregate amount of board authorized available capacity  and fpl had billion of board authorized available capacity 
credit ratings nextera energy and fpl liquidity  ability to access credit and capital markets  cost of borrowings and collateral posting requirements under certain agreements are dependent on their credit ratings 
at february   moody investors service  inc moody  standard poor ratings services s p and fitch ratings fitch had assigned the following credit ratings to nextera energy  fpl and capital holdings moody a s p a fitch a nextera energy b corporate credit rating baa a a fpl b corporate credit rating a a a first mortgage bonds aa a aa pollution control  solid waste disposal and industrial development revenue bonds vmig a a commercial paper p a f capital holdings b corporate credit rating baa a a debentures baa bbb a junior subordinated debentures baa bbb bbb commercial paper p a f a a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities and should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
the rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization 
b the outlook indicated by moody  s p and fitch is stable  stable and negative  respectively 
nextera energy and its subsidiaries  including fpl  have no credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt 
a change in ratings is not an event of default under applicable debt instruments  and while there are conditions to drawing on the fpl  capital holdings and canadian credit facilities  the maintenance of a specific minimum credit rating is not a condition to drawing on these credit facilities 
commitment fees and interest rates on loans under these credit facilities agreements are tied to credit ratings 
a ratings downgrade also could reduce the accessibility and increase the cost of commercial paper and other short term debt issuances and additional or replacement credit facilities 
in addition  a ratings downgrade could result in the re quirement that nextera energy subsidiaries  including fpl  post collateral under certain agreements  including those related to fuel procurement  power sales and purchases  nuclear decommissioning funding  debt related reserves and trading activities 
fpl and capital holdings credit facilities are available to support these potential requirements

cash flow the changes in cash and cash equivalents are summarized as follows nextera energy fpl years ended december  millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents nextera energy cash and cash equivalents increased for the year ended december  reflecting cash generated by operating activities  net issuances of long term debt  issuance of common stock  proceeds from the sale of differential membership interests and cash grants received under the recovery act 
these inflows were partially offset by capital investments by fpl and nextera energy resources  a net decrease in short term debt and the payment of common stock dividends to nextera energy shareholders 
nextera energy cash flows from operating activities for the year ended december  reflect cash generated by net income and derivative related activities  including margin cash collateral provided from nextera energy resources counterparties as a result of changing energy prices  prepaid option premiums and settlements 
these inflows were partially offset by cash outflows related to fpl cost recovery clauses and franchise fees  primarily the fuel clause 
nextera energy cash flows from investing activities for the year ended december  reflect capital investments  including nuclear fuel purchases  of approximately billion by fpl to expand and enhance its electric system and generating facilities to continue to provide reliable service to meet the power needs of present and future customers and investments in independent power projects  including nuclear fuel  of approximately billion by nextera energy resources 
nextera energy cash flows from investing activities also include approximately million comprised of million and million at nextera energy resources and fpl  respectively of cash grants under the recovery act  the purchase and sale of restricted securities held in the special use funds  including the reinvestment of fund earn ings and new contributions by nextera energy resources  as well as other investment activity  primarily at capital holdings

covenants nextera energy charter does not limit the dividends that may be paid on its common stock 
as a practical matter  the ability of nextera energy to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent upon  among other things  dividends paid to it by its subsidiaries 
during the first quarter of  nextera energy increased the quarterly dividend on its common stock from to per share 
in february  nextera energy announced that it would increase the quarterly dividend on its common stock from to per share 
fpl pays dividends to nextera energy in a manner consistent with fpl long term targeted capital structure 
the mortgage securing fpl first mortgage bonds contains provisions which  under certain conditions  restrict the payment of dividends to nextera energy and the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds 
in light of fpl current financial condition and level of earnings  management does not expect that planned financing activities or dividends would be affected by these limitations 
under the mortgage  in some cases  the amount of retained earnings that fpl can use to pay cash dividends on its common stock is restricted 
the restricted amount may change based on factors set out in the mortgage 
other than this restriction on the payment of common stock dividends  the mortgage does not restrict fpl use of retained earnings 
as of december   no retained earnings were restricted by these provisions of the mortgage 
fpl may issue first mortgage bonds under its mortgage subject to its meeting an adjusted net earnings test set forth in the mortgage  which generally requires adjusted net earnings to be at least twice the annual interest requirements on  or at least of the aggregate principal amount of  fpl first mortgage bonds including those to be issued and any other non junior fpl indebtedness 
as of december   coverage for the months ended december  would have been approximately times the annual interest requirements and approximately times the aggregate principal requirements 
new first mortgage bonds are also limited to an amount equal to the sum of of unfunded property additions after adjustments to offset property retirements  the amount of retired first mortgage bonds or q ualified lien bonds and the amount of cash on deposit with the mortgage trustee 
as of december   fpl could have issued in excess of billion of additional first mortgage bonds based on the unfunded property additions and in excess of billion based on retired first mortgage bonds 
as of december   no cash was deposited with the mortgage trustee for these purposes

critical accounting policies and estimates nextera energy and fpl significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
critical accounting policies are those that nextera energy and fpl believe are both most important to the portrayal of their financial condition and results of operations  and require complex  subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
nextera energy and fpl consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing their consolidated financial statements accounting for derivatives and hedging activities nextera energy and fpl use derivative instruments primarily swaps  options  futures and forwards to manage the commodity price risk inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity  as well as interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with outstanding and forecasted debt 
in addition  nextera energy  through nextera energy resources  uses derivatives to optimize the value of power generation assets 
nextera energy resources provides full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to distribution utilities  which include load following services and various ancillary services  in certain markets and engages in power and gas marketing and trading activities to take a dvantage of expected future favorable price movements 
accounting pronouncements  which require the use of fair value accounting if certain conditions are met  apply not only to traditional financial derivative instruments  but to any contract having the accounting characteristics of a derivative 
derivative instruments  when required to be marked to market  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
fair values for some of the longer term contracts where liquid markets are not available are based on internally developed models based on the forward prices for electricity and fuel 
forward prices represent the price at which a buyer or seller could contract today to purchase or sell a commodity at a future date 
in general  the models estimate the fair value of a contract by calculating the present value of the difference between the contract price and the forward prices 
the near term forward market for electricity is generally liquid and therefore the prices in the early years of the forward curves reflect observable market quotes 
however  in the later years  the ma rket is much less liquid and forward price curves must be developed using factors including the forward prices for the commodities used as fuel to generate electricity  the expected system heat rate which measures the efficiency of power plants in converting fuel to electricity in the region where the purchase or sale takes place  and a fundamental forecast of expected spot prices based on modeled supply and demand in the region 
the assumptions in these models are critical since any changes therein could have a significant impact on the fair value of the contract 
substantially all changes in the fair value of derivatives held by fpl are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled 
upon settlement  any gains or losses will be passed through the fuel or capacity clauses 
in nextera energy non rate regulated operations  predominantly nextera energy resources  changes in derivative fair values are recognized in current earnings  un less the criteria for hedge accounting are met and the company elects to account for the derivative as a hedge 
for those transactions accounted for as cash flow hedges  much of the effects of changes in fair value are reflected in other comprehensive income oci  a component of common shareholders equity  rather than being recognized in current earnings 
for those transactions accounted for as fair value hedges  the effects of changes in fair value are reflected in current earnings offset by changes in the fair value of the item being hedged 
much of the existing accounting guidance related to derivatives focuses on when certain contracts for the purchase and sale of power and certain fuel supply contracts can be excluded from derivative accounting rules  however the guidance does not address all contract issues 
as a result  significant judgment must be used in applying derivatives accounting guidance to contracts 
in the event changes in interpretation occur  it is possible that contracts that currently are excluded from derivatives accounting rules would have to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value  with changes in the fair value recorded in the statement of income 
certain economic hedging transactions at nextera energy resources do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting treatment 
changes in the fair value of those transactions are marked to market and reported in the statement of income  often resulting in earnings volatility 
these changes in fair value are captured in the non qualifying hedge category in computing adjusted earnings 
this could be significant to nextera energy resources results because often the economic offset to the positions which are required to be marked to market such as the physical assets from which power is generated are not marked to market 
as a consequence  net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically linked transactions 
because of this  nextera energy management views result s expressed excluding the unrealized mark to market impact of the non qualifying hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance 
for additional information regarding derivative instruments  see note  results of operations and energy marketing and trading and market risk sensitivity 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits nextera energy sponsors a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employees of nextera energy and its subsidiaries 
nextera energy also has a supplemental executive retirement plan serp which includes a non qualified supplemental defined benefit pension component that provides benefits to a select group of management and highly compensated employees 
the impact of the serp component is included within the pension plan as discussed below 
in addition to pension benefits  nextera energy sponsors a contributory postretirement plan for health care and life insurance benefits other benefits plan for retirees of nextera energy and its subsidiaries meeti ng certain eligibility requirements 
the qualified pension plan has a fully funded trust dedicated to providing the benefits under the plan 
the other benefits plan has a partially funded trust dedicated to providing benefits related to life insurance 
nextera energy allocates net periodic benefit income or cost associated with the pension and other benefits plans to its subsidiaries annually using specific criteria 
nextera energy regulatory assets and liabilities were established in association with the implementation of accounting guidance in a prior year which requires recognition of the funded status of benefit plans in the balance sheet  with changes in the funded status recognized in comprehensive income within shareholders equity in the year in which the changes occur 
since nextera energy is the plan sponsor  and its subsidiaries do not have separate rights to the plan assets or direct obligations to their employees  the results of implementing the accounting guidance were reflected at nextera energy and not allocated to the subsidiaries 
the portion of previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses  prior service costs or credits and transition obligations that were estimated to be allocable to fpl as net periodic benefit income cost in future periods and that otherwise would have been recorded in accumu lated other comprehensive income aoci were classified as regulatory assets and liabilities at nextera energy in accordance with regulatory treatment 
nextera energy income from its pension plan  net of the cost of the other benefits plan  was approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the corresponding amounts allocated to fpl were million  million and million  respectively 
pension income and the cost of the other benefits plan are included in o m expenses  and are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions 
those assumptions include an expected long term rate of return on qualified plan assets of for all years for the pension plan and for all years for the other benefits plan  assumed increases in salary of for all years  and weighted average discount rates of  and for the pension plan and  and for the other benefits plan for the years ended december   and  respectively 
based on current health care costs as related to other benefits  the projected trend assumption used to measure the expected cost of health care benefits covered by the plans for those under age is for medical and for prescription drug benefits and for those age and over is for medical and for prescription drug benefits 
these rates are assumed to decrease over the next years for medical benefits and years for prescription drug benefits to the ultimate trend rate of and remain at that level thereafter 
the ultimate trend rate is assumed to be reached in for medical benefits and for prescription drug benefits 
in developing these assumptions  nextera energy evaluated input from its actuaries  as well as information available in the marketplace 
for the expected long term rate of return on fund assets  nextera energy considered year and year historical median returns for a portfolio with an equity bond asset mix similar to its funds  as well as its funds historical compounded returns 
nextera energy also considered input from its actuaries and consultants  as well as information available in the marketplace 
nextera energy believes that and are reasonable long term rates of return on its pension plan and other benefits plan assets  respectively 
nextera energy will continue to evaluate all of its actuarial assumptions  including its expected rate of return  at least annually  and will adjust them as necessary 
nextera energy bases its determination of pension and other benefits plan expense or income on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period following the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return realized on those assets 
since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period  the future value of assets will be affected as previously deferred gains or losses are recognized 
such gains and losses together with other differences between actual results and the estimates used in the actuaria l valuations are deferred and recognized in determining pension and other benefits plan expense and income only to the extent they exceed of the greater of projected benefit obligations or the market related value of assets 
the following table illustrates the effect on net periodic benefit income of changing the critical actuarial assumptions discussed above  while holding all other assumptions constant decrease in net periodic benefit income change in assumption nextera energy fpl millions expected long term rate of return discount rate salary increase health care cost trend rate a a assumed health care cost trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for postretirement plans providing health care benefits 
however  this effect is somewhat mitigated by the retiree cost sharing structure incorporated in nextera energy other benefits plan 
the fair value of plan assets has increased from billion at december  to billion at december  for the pension plan and remained constant at million at december  and for the other benefits plan 
management believes that  based on the actuarial assumptions and the well funded status of the pension plan  nextera energy will not be required to make any cash contributions to the qualified pension plan in the near future 
in december  million was transferred from the qualified pension plan as reimbursement for eligible retiree medical expenses paid by nextera energy during the year pursuant to the provisions of the internal revenue code 
nextera energy anticipates paying approximately million for eligible retiree medical expenses on behal f of the other benefits plan during with substantially all of that amount being reimbursed through a transfer of assets from the qualified pension plan 
see note carrying value of long lived assets nextera energy evaluates on an ongoing basis the recoverability of its assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is required to be recognized if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows associated with that asset 
the impairment loss to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds the asset fair value 
in most instances  the fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate interest rate 
the amount of future net cash flows  the timing of the cash flows and the determination of an appropriate interest rate all involve estimates and judgments about future events 
in particular  the aggregate amount of cash flows determines whether an impairment exists  and the timing of the cash flows is critical in determining fair value 
because each assessment is based on the facts and circumstances associated with each long lived asset  the effects of changes in assumptions cannot be generalized 
nuclear decommissioning and fossil solar dismantlement the components of nextera energy and fpl decommissioning of nuclear plants  dismantlement of plants and other accrued asset removal costs are as follows fpl nuclear decommissioning fossil solar dismantlement interim removal costs and other nextera energy resources nextera energy december  december  december  december  december  millions aros less capitalized aro asset net of accumulated depreciation accrued asset removal costs a asset retirement obligation regulatory expense difference a accrued decommissioning  dismantlement and other accrued asset removal costs b b b b b b a regulatory liability on nextera energy and fpl consolidated balance sheets 
b represents total amount accrued for ratemaking purposes 
nextera energy and fpl each account for asset retirement obligations and conditional asset retirement obligations collectively  aros under accounting guidance that requires a liability for the fair value of an aro to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if it can be reasonably estimated  with the offsetting associated asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived assets 
see note asset retirement obligations  note decommissioning of nuclear plants  dismantlement of plants and other accrued asset removal costs and note for ratemaking purposes  fpl accrues and funds for nuclear plant decommissioning costs over the expected service life of each unit based on studies that are filed with the fpsc at least every five years 
the most recent studies  filed in  indicate that fpl portion of the future cost of decommissioning its four nuclear units  including spent fuel storage above what is expected to be refunded by the doe under the spent fuel settlement agreement  is approximately billion  or billion in dollars 
the studies reflect  among other things  the expiration dates of the operating licenses for fpl nuclear units 
fpl accrues the cost of dismantling its fossil and solar plants over the expected service life of each unit based on studies filed with the fpsc 
unlike nuclear decommiss ioning  dismantlement costs are not funded 
the most recent studies became effective january  at december   fpl portion of the ultimate cost to dismantle its fossil and solar units is approximately million  or million expressed in dollars 
the majority of the dismantlement costs are not considered aros 
in addition  fpl accrues for interim removal costs over the life of the related assets based on depreciation studies approved by the fpsc 
any differences between the aro amount recorded and the amount recorded for ratemaking purposes are reported as a regulatory liability in accordance with regulatory accounting 
nextera energy resources records a liability for the present value of its expected decommissioning costs which is determined using various internal and external data and applying a probability percentage to a variety of scenarios regarding the life of the plant and timing of decommissioning 
the liability is being accreted using the interest method through the date decommissioning activities are expected to be complete 
at december   the aro for nuclear decommissioning of nextera energy resources nuclear plants totaled approximately million 
nextera energy resources portion of the ultimate cost of decommissioning its nuclear plants  including costs associated with spent fuel storage above what is expected to be refunded by the doe under the spent fuel settlement agreement  is estima ted to be approximately billion  or billion expressed in dollars 
the calculation of the future cost of retiring long lived assets  including nuclear decommissioning and fossil and solar dismantlement costs  involves estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures and making judgments concerning whether or not such costs are considered a legal obligation 
estimating the amount and timing of future expenditures includes  among other things  making projections of when assets will be retired and ultimately decommissioned and how costs will escalate with inflation 
in addition  nextera energy and fpl also make interest rate and rate of return projections on their investments in determining recommended funding requirements for nuclear decommissioning costs 
periodically  nextera energy and fpl are required to update these estimates and projections which can affect the annual expense amounts recognized  the liabilities recorded and the annual funding requirements for nuclear decommissioning costs 
for example  an increase of in the assumed escalation rates would increase nextera energy and fpl aro as of december  by million and million  respectively 
regulatory accounting accounting guidance allows regulators to create assets and impose liabilities that would not be recorded by non rate regulated entities 
regulatory assets and liabilities represent probable future revenues that will be recovered from or refunded to customers through the ratemaking process 
if fpl were no longer subject to cost based rate regulation  the existing regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless regulators specify an alternative means of recovery or refund 
in addition  the fpsc has the authority to disallow recovery of costs that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred 
such costs may include  among others  fuel and o m expenses  the cost of replacing power lost when fossil and nuclear units are unavailable  storm restoration costs and costs associated with the construction or acquisition of new facilities 
the continued applicability of regulatory accounting is assessed at each reporting period 
nextera energy and fpl regulatory assets and liabilities are as follows nextera energy fpl december  december  regulatory assets millions current deferred clause and franchise expenses derivatives other noncurrent securitized storm recovery costs other regulatory liabilities current deferred clause and franchise revenues other noncurrent accrued asset removal costs asset retirement obligation regulatory expense difference other all regulatory assets and liabilities are included in rate base or otherwise earn pay a return on investment during the recovery period 
see note for a discussion of nextera energy and fpl other significant accounting policies 
energy marketing and trading and market risk sensitivity energy marketing and trading certain of nextera energy subsidiaries  including fpl and nextera energy resources  use derivative instruments primarily swaps  options  futures and forwards to manage the commodity price risk inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity 
in addition  nextera energy  through nextera energy resources  uses derivatives to optimize the value of power generation assets 
nextera energy resources provides full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to distribution utilities  which include load following services and various ancillary services  in certain markets and engages in power and gas marketing and trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements 
derivative instruments  when required to be marked to market  are recorded on nextera energy and fpl consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability measured at fair value 
at fpl  substantially all changes in the derivatives fair value are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled  and  upon settlement  any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause or the capacity clause 
for nextera energy non rate regulated operations  predominantly nextera energy resources  unless hedge accounting is applied essentially all changes in the derivatives fair value for power purchases and sales and trading activities are recognized on a net basis in operating revenues  fuel purchases and sales are recognized on a net basis in fuel  purchased power and interchange expe nse  and the equity method investees related activity is recognized in equity in earnings of equity method investees in nextera energy consolidated statements of income

market risk is measured as the potential loss in fair value resulting from hypothetical reasonably possible changes in commodity prices  interest rates  equity prices or currency exchange rates over the next year 
with respect to certain debt issuances and borrowings  capital holdings has entered into three cross currency swaps  two to hedge against currency movements with respect to both interest and principal payments and one to hedge against currency and interest rate movements with respect to both interest and principal payments 
at december  and  the fair value of these cross currency swaps was approximately million and million  respectively 
management has established risk management policies to monitor and manage market risks 
with respect to commodities  nextera energy exposure management committee emc  which is comprised of certain members of senior management  is responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels 
the emc receives periodic updates on market positions and related exposures  credit exposures and overall risk management activities 
nextera energy and its subsidiaries are also exposed to credit risk through their energy marketing and trading operations 
credit risk is the risk that a financial loss will be incurred if a counterparty to a transaction does not fulfill its financial obligation 
nextera energy manages counterparty credit risk for its subsidiaries with energy marketing and trading operations through established policies  including counterparty credit limits  and in some cases credit enhancements  such as cash prepayments  letters of credit  cash and other collateral and guarantees 
credit risk is also managed through the use of master netting agreements 
nextera energy credit department monitors current and forward credit exposure to counterparties and their affiliates  both on an individual and an aggrega te basis 
commodity price risk nextera energy uses a value at risk var model to measure market risk in its trading and mark to market portfolios 
the var is the estimated nominal loss of market value based on a one day holding period at a confidence level using historical simulation methodology 
as of december  and  the var figures are as follows trading non qualifying hedges and hedges in oci and fpl cost recovery clauses a total fpl nextera energy resources nextera energy fpl nextera energy resources nextera energy fpl nextera energy resources nextera energy millions december  december  average for the period ended december  a non qualifying hedges are employed to reduce the market risk exposure to physical assets or contracts which are not marked to market 
the var figures for the non qualifying hedges and hedges in oci and fpl cost recovery clauses category do not represent the economic exposure to commodity price movements 
interest rate risk nextera energy and fpl are exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of their respective issuances of debt  investments in special use funds and other investments 
nextera energy and fpl manage their respective interest rate exposure by monitoring current interest rates  entering into interest rate swaps and adjusting their variable rate debt in relation to total capitalization 
the following are estimates of the fair value of nextera energy and fpl financial instruments december  december  carrying amount estimated fair value carrying amount estimated fair value millions nextera energy fixed income securities special use funds a a other investments a a long term debt  including current maturities b b interest rate swaps net unrealized losses c c fpl fixed income securities special use funds a a long term debt  including current maturities b b a based on quoted market prices for these or similar issues 
b based on market prices provided by external sources 
c based on market prices modeled internally 
the special use funds of nextera energy and fpl consist of restricted funds set aside to cover the cost of storm damage for fpl and for the decommissioning of nextera energy and fpl nuclear power plants 
a portion of these funds is invested in fixed income debt securities carried at their market value 
at fpl  adjustments to market value result in a corresponding adjustment to the related liability accounts based on current regulatory treatment 
the market value adjustments of nextera energy non rate regulated operations result in a corresponding adjustment to oci  except for impairments deemed to be other than temporary which are reported in current period earnings 
because the funds set aside by fpl for storm damage could be needed at any time  the related investments are generally m ore liquid and  therefore  are less sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the nuclear decommissioning funds  in contrast  are generally invested in longer term securities  as decommissioning activities are not scheduled to begin until at least at fpl 
nextera energy and its subsidiaries use a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage interest rate exposure 
interest rate swaps are used to mitigate and adjust interest rate exposure when deemed appropriate based upon market conditions or when required by financing agreements 
at december   the estimated fair value for nextera energy interest rate swaps was as follows notional amount effective date maturity date rate paid rate received estimated fair value millions millions fair value hedges capital holdings june september variable a may november variable b august september variable c total fair value hedges cash flow hedges nextera energy resources december december variable d april december variable d december november variable d january january variable e january september variable d january december variable d january f december variable d january december variable g march december variable d march f december variable d may may variable d may f may variable d december december variable d december f september variable d april january variable e october september variable d december january variable e capital holdings october f june variable d october f september variable d october f june variable d total cash flow hedges total interest rate swaps a three month london interbank offered rate libor plus

based upon a hypothetical decrease in interest rates  which is a reasonable near term market change  the net fair value of nextera energy net liabilities would increase by approximately million million for fpl at december  equity price risk included in the nuclear decommissioning reserve funds of nextera energy are marketable equity securities carried at their market value of approximately  million and  million  million and  million for fpl at december  and  respectively 
a hypothetical decrease in the prices quoted by stock exchanges  which is a reasonable near term market change  would result in a million million for fpl reduction in fair value and corresponding adjustments to the related liability accounts based on current regulatory treatment for fpl  or adjustments to oci for nextera energy non rate regulated operations  at december  credit risk for all derivative and contractual transactions  nextera energy energy marketing and trading operations  which includes fpl energy marketing and trading division  are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these transactions 
relevant considerations when assessing nextera energy energy marketing and trading operations credit risk exposure include operations are primarily concentrated in the energy industry 
trade receivables and other financial instruments are predominately with energy  utility and financial services related companies  as well as municipalities  cooperatives and other trading companies in the united states 
overall credit risk is managed through established credit policies 
prospective and existing customers are reviewed for creditworthiness based upon established standards  with customers not meeting minimum standards providing various credit enhancements or secured payment terms  such as letters of credit or the posting of margin cash collateral 
the use of master netting agreements to offset cash and non cash gains and losses arising from derivative instruments with the same counterparty 
nextera energy policy is to have master netting agreements in place with significant counterparties 
based on nextera energy policies and risk exposures related to credit  nextera energy and fpl do not anticipate a material adverse effect on their financial positions as a result of counterparty nonperformance 
as of december   approximately of nextera energy and of fpl energy marketing and trading counterparty credit risk exposure is associated with companies that have investment grade credit ratings
