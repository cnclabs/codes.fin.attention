all forward looking statements included herein are based on information available to us on the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
we caution you that our business and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
in evaluating our business  you should also carefully consider the information set forth under the caption risk factors contained in item a above in addition to the information contained in this item we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto in item financial statements and supplementary data 
overview we design  manufacture and sell optical networking components and subsystems 
our products expand optical bandwidth  amplify optical signals  monitor and protect wavelength performance  redirect light signals  ensure bandwidth distribution connectivity and provide signal transmission and reception within an optical network 
our products enable greater and higher quality bandwidth over longer distances  which reduces network congestion and transmission cost per bit 
our products also enable optical system manufacturers to provide flexible and scalable bandwidth to support the increase of data traffic on the internet and other public and private networks 
we offer our customers design  integration and optical manufacturing solutions oms for the production and packaging of highly integrated optical subsystems and turnkey solutions  based upon a customer specific product design and specifications 
we also offer solutions with lower levels of component integration for customers that place more value on flexibility than would be provided with turnkey solutions 
our fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to june for presentation purposes  we present each fiscal year as if it ended on june fiscal years and consisted of weeks 
fiscal is a week fiscal year  one week more than a typical fiscal year 
the extra week was included in the first quarter of fiscal revenues 
we generate substantially all of our revenues from the sale of fiber optic components and subsystems 
our products are generally categorized into the four following major groups bandwidth creation products  which include wavelength expansion and optical amplification products  bandwidth management products  which include optical switching products and wavelength performance monitoring and protection products  transmission products  which include fiber optic transmitters  receivers  transceivers and transponders  and optical interconnect products  which include signal connectivity and distribution products 
cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues consists of raw material  salaries including stock compensation expense and related personnel expenses  manufacturing overhead  provisions for excess and obsolete inventories  amortization of intangible assets  and warranty costs 
we expect cost of revenues  as a percentage of revenues  to fluctuate from period to period 
our gross margins will primarily be affected by mix of products sold  salaries and related personnel expenses  manufacturing volume  pricing policies  production yield  costs incurred in improving manufacturing processes  provisions for excess and obsolete inventories and warranty costs 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries including stock compensation expense and related personnel costs  depreciation  non recurring engineering charges and prototype costs  patent filing costs and fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  all of which relate to the design  development  testing  pre manufacturing and significant improvement of our products 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 

table of contents sales and marketing expenses 
our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries including stock compensation expense and related expenses for marketing  sales  customer service and application engineering support personnel  commissions paid to internal and external sales representatives  as well as costs associated with trade shows and other marketing expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries including stock compensation expense and related expenses for executive  finance  accounting  and human resources personnel  professional fees and other corporate expenses 
stock compensation expense 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc  which establishes accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services 
accordingly  stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employee requisite service period 
our stock compensation is generally accounted for as an equity instrument 
stock compensation expense recorded in cost of revenues  research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative is the amortization of the fair value of share based payments made to employees and members of our board of directors  primarily in the form of stock options  restricted stock awards and units rsas and rsus and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan pursuant to the provisions of asc as of june   the unrecorded deferred stock compensation balance related to stock options to purchase oplink common stock was million which will be recognized over an estimated weighted average amortization period of years 
the unrecorded deferred stock compensation balance related to rsus was million which will be recognized over an estimated weighted average amortization period of years 
approximately  of stock compensation was capitalized as inventory at june  and during the year ended june   we granted  stock options and  restricted stock awards and units  with a total grant date fair value of  and million  respectively 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  accounts receivable  inventories  tangible and intangible assets  warranty obligations  stock compensation  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
these estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis and by the audit committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  and our procedures relating to these policies  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our consolidated financial statements and requires us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
these policies may require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates that we could have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
our critical accounting policies cover the following areas revenue recognition and product returns we recognize revenue from product sales upon delivery of the product or customer acceptance  whichever is later  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and no significant obligations remain  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue associated with contract related cancellation payments from customers when a formal agreement is signed or a 
table of contents purchase order is issued by the customer covering these payments and we determine the collectibility of the cancellation payments to be reasonably assured 
in addition  we estimate future product returns based upon actual historical return rates and reduce our revenue by these estimated future returns 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  future estimates could be revised accordingly 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation expenses are computed using the straight line method based upon the useful lives of the assets 
estimated useful lives of to years are used for buildings and to years are used for manufacturing and engineering equipment 
estimated useful lives of to years are used for computer hardware and software 
in addition  we have land occupancy rights for a period of years 
leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method based upon the shorter of the estimated useful lives or the lease term of the respective assets 
land and construction in progress are not depreciated 
improvements and betterments are capitalized if they extend the useful life of the asset 
repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred 
gain loss on sale or disposal of fixed assets is recognized in the period which the gain loss occurs 
accrued warranty we provide reserves for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized based on historical experience of known product failure rates and expected material and labor costs to provide warranty services 
we generally provide a one year warranty on our products 
additionally  from time to time  specific warranty accruals may be made if unforeseen technical problems arise 
alternatively  if estimates are determined to be greater than the actual amounts necessary  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods 
allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable are derived from revenue earned from customers located in the united states  canada  europe  china  japan and other countries 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customer financial condition and currently require no collateral from our customers 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in anticipation of the inability or unwillingness of customers to make required payments 
when we become aware that a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations  such as the result of bankruptcy or deterioration in the customer operating results or financial position  we record a specific allowance equal to the amount due to reflect the level of credit risk in the customer outstanding receivable balance 
we are not able to predict changes in the financial condition of customers  nor are we able to predict whether a customer experiencing financial difficulties will ultimately pay us the amounts owed 
if the condition or circumstances of our customers deteriorates  estimates of the recoverability of trade receivables could be materially affected and we may be required to record additional allowances  which would negatively affect our operating results in that period 
alternatively  if our estimates are determined to be greater than the actual amounts necessary  we may reverse a portion of such allowance in future periods based on actual collection experience  which would positively increase our operating results in future periods 
excess and obsolete inventory we regularly assess the valuation of inventories and write down those inventories which are obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage to their estimated realizable value 
estimates of realizable value are based upon our analysis and assumptions including  but not limited to  forecasted sales levels by product  expected product lifecycle  product development plans and future demand requirements 
if market conditions are less favorable than our forecast or actual demand from customers is lower than our estimates  we may be required to record additional inventory write downs 
at the point of write down  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
if there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we could be required to increase inventory write downs  and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
if demand is higher than expected  we may sell inventories that had previously been written down as was the case in the years ended june   and in such instances  our gross margins were positively impacted by the utilization of previously reserved inventory of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 

table of contents impairment of investments we determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date 
our marketable securities may be classified as either held to maturity or available for sale 
held to maturity securities represent those securities that we have both the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
available for sale securities represent those securities that do not meet the classification of held to maturity or trading securities and are carried at fair value 
should a decline in the fair value of an individual security or securities be judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the security would be written down to fair value and the amount of the write down would be accounted for as a realized loss 
factors considered in determining whether a loss is temporary include the magnitude of the decline in market value  the length of time the fair value has been below the cost basis of the security  our ability and intent to hold the security for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery of fair value up to or beyond the cost of the security  and whether a credit loss exists 
impairment of long lived asset we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of property  plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
these events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a prolonged industry downturn  a significant decline in our market value  or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  we generally compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we would write down such assets based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
fair value is generally determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our weighted average cost of capital  and specific appraisal in certain instances 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rate and terminal growth rates 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of long lived assets  thereby requiring us to write down the assets 
there was no impairment charge related to long lived assets recorded in fiscal  or impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the consideration paid for a business acquisition over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but rather be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
the impairment test is a two step process 
in the event that we determine that the value of goodwill has become impaired  we will record an impairment loss during the fiscal quarter in which the determination is made 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment 
in fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to goodwill acquired as part of oplinkacquisition of optical communication products  inc ocp in fiscal and and f and fibercom optics communication corp fibercom in fiscal we did not record any goodwill impairment charge in fiscal or fair value accounting fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities  which are required to be recorded at fair value  we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  such as inherent risk  transfer restrictions and credit risk 

table of contents the fair value of our level financial assets is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical underlying securities and generally include money market funds 
determining fair value for level instruments generally does not require significant management judgment 
the fair value of our level financial assets is based on inputs observable for the underlying securities other than quoted prices included within level and generally include united states treasury securities  united states government agency debt securities  certificates of deposit  commercial paper  and corporate bonds 
these level instruments require more management judgment and subjectivity compared to level instruments which include determining which instruments are most similar to the instrument being priced  determining whether the market is active and determining which model derived valuations are to be used when calculating fair value 
we do not hold any financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value using level inputs  which requires significant management judgment 
business combinations in fiscal  we adopted asc topic  business combination asc  which revised the accounting guidance that we used to account for our acquisitions prior to fiscal in accordance with asc  we recognize separately from goodwill  the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree generally at their fair values as defined by asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures asc 
goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred  which is generally measured at fair value  and the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
acquisition related transaction costs and costs associated with restructuring activities initiated by us are accounted for as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred 
we record the values of assets and liabilities based on independent valuations and internal estimate 
the determination of fair value requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions  and accordingly  our financial position or results of operations may be affected by changes in these estimates and assumptions 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method  which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial statement reported amounts  and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to taxation in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions 
the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions 
our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses  the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region  and the availability of tax credits and carryforwards 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  and the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
consequently  taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability and or our effective income tax rate 
we are subject to income tax audits by the respective tax authorities in all of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the determination of tax liabilities in each of these jurisdictions requires the interpretation and application of complex and sometimes uncertain tax laws and regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the provisions of asc topic  income taxes asc 
if we ultimately determine that the payment of such a liability is not necessary  then we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which the determination is made that the liability is no longer necessary 
see note income taxes in the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

table of contents stock compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the provision of asc we utilize the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the grant date fair value of employee stock options  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected volatility and expected life 
historical volatility was used in estimating the fair value of our stock compensation awards  while the expected life for our options was estimated based on historical trends 
further  we estimate forfeitures for stock compensation awards that are not expected to vest 
changes in these inputs and assumptions can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our stock compensation 
we expense the estimated fair value to earnings on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the underlying awards  which is generally four years for our stock compensation awards and up to two years for purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
as our stock options and employee stock purchase plan awards have characteristics that differ significantly from traded options  and as changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value  our estimate of fair value may not accurately represent the value assigned by a third party in an arms length transaction 
there currently is no market based mechanism to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates derived from the black scholes option valuation model or other allowable valuation models  nor is there a method to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
while our estimate of fair value and the associated charge to earnings materially affects our results of operations  it has no impact on our cash position 
there are significant variations among allowable valuation models  and there is a possibility that we may adopt a different valuation model or refine the inputs and assumptions under our current valuation model in the future resulting in a lack of consistency in future periods 
our current or future valuation model and the inputs and assumptions we make may also lack comparability to other companies that use different models  inputs  or assumptions  and the resulting differences in comparability could be material 
loss contingencies we are or have been subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
we evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with gaap 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceedings is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based upon management judgment and the best information available to management at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates  which could materially impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
results of operations for fiscal  and revenues years ended percentage years ended percentage june  change change june  change change in thousands  except percentages revenues we acquired emit technology co  ltd 
emit in the third quarter of fiscal the acquisition of emit contributed approximately million and million of revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
excluding the impact of the emit acquisition  revenues for fiscal increased million compared to fiscal the increase was mainly driven by increased unit shipments in all our major product categories  in particular our roadm optical switching and routing products  partially offset by a slight decline in average selling prices  which is a characteristic of the industry in which we operate 
the increase in shipments was largely due to increase in demands from our customers 

table of contents excluding the impact of the emit acquisition which contributed approximately million of revenues in fiscal  revenues for fiscal decreased million compared to fiscal the decrease was mainly due to decreased unit shipments of our line transmission application product  roadm optical switching and routing product and monitoring and conditioning product  partially offset by increased revenues of our multiplexer product and optical amplification product 
a decline in average selling prices also contributed to the decrease in revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal historically  a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue 
our top five customers  although not the same five customers for each period  together accounted for  and of our revenues in the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
we expect that the majority of our revenues will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers 
gross profit years ended percentage years ended percentage june  change change june  change change in thousands  except percentages gross profit gross profit margin the increase in gross profit for fiscal compared to fiscal was mainly driven by higher revenues  partially offset by higher material costs as a result of increased revenues  higher labor costs and manufacturing overhead expenses due to higher employee compensation expenses in china  and lower utilization of previously reserved inventory 
during fiscal  we increased our wage rates at our manufacturing facilities in zhuhai by more than due to government mandated increases in minimum wage levels 
our gross profit for fiscal was positively impacted by sales of inventory that had been previously reserved of million and was positively impacted by the sales of previously reserved inventory of million in fiscal our gross profit margin increased in fiscal compared to fiscal mainly due to lower manufacturing overhead expenses and material costs as a percentage of revenues  partially offset by higher labor costs as a percentage of revenues and lower utilization of previously reserved inventory 
the increase in gross profit for fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflected lower material costs  lower provision for excess and obsolete inventory  higher utilization of previously reserved inventory  and lower manufacturing overhead expenses  partially offset by lower revenues and higher direct labor costs 
the higher labor costs were primarily due to increases in employee headcount and higher employee compensation expenses in china 
we increased our wage rates at our manufacturing facilities in zhuhai by more than due to government mandated increases in minimum wage levels in fiscal in fiscal  we recorded a provision for excess and obsolete inventory of million which was primarily related to our line transmission application product 
our gross profit for fiscal was positively impacted by sales of inventory that had been previously reserved of million  compared to sales of previously reserved inventory of million in fiscal our gross profit margin increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to lower material costs as a percentage of revenues  lower provision for excess and obsolete inventory  and higher utilization of previously reserved inventory  partially offset by higher labor costs and manufacturing overhead expenses as a percentage of revenues 

table of contents research and development years ended percentage years ended percentage june  change change june  change change in thousands  except percentages research and development stock based compensation total expenses research and development expenses increased million for fiscal compared to fiscal the increase mainly reflected higher salary and compensation expenses as a result of increases in headcount  salary and implementation of cash incentive plans and higher costs of materials associated with increase level of product development projects 
research and development expenses decreased  for fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease was mainly driven by cost savings as a result of continued integration of ocp  more research and development programs being transitioned from higher cost facilities in the united states to lower cost facilities in china  and other cost reduction measures 
we believe that developing customer solutions at the prototype stage is critical to our strategic product development objectives 
we further believe that  in order to meet the changing requirements of our customers  we will need to fund investments in several concurrent product development projects and to assign more employees to these projects 
in addition  we intend to devote more resources to development of new products to serve our current market as well as products for expansion into new markets 
as a result  we expect our research and development expenses in fiscal will increase compared to fiscal the research and development process can be expensive and prolonged and entails considerable uncertainty 
as such  we can make no assurances that any of the products we plan to develop will be commercially successful  and there is a substantial risk that our research and development expenditures will fail to generate any meaningful return of the investment of such resources 
sales and marketing years ended percentage years ended percentage june  change change june  change change in thousands  except percentages sales and marketing stock based compensation total expenses sales and marketing expenses increased million for fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was mainly due to higher salary and compensation expenses driven by an increase in headcount and higher sales commission expenses as a result of increased revenues 
our acquisition of emit in the third quarter of fiscal further contributed to the increase in sales and marketing expenses for fiscal compared to sales and marketing expenses increased slightly for fiscal compared to fiscal the acquisition of emit accounted for approximately  of the total increase in sales and marketing expenses 
excluding the impact of the emit acquisition  the increase in sales and marketing expenses was mainly due to higher stock compensation expense

the fair value of stock options and purchase rights granted to purchase our common stock under the employee stock purchase plan is estimated using a black scholes valuation model and is recognized as expense over the employee requisite service period 
the compensation expense incurred for rsas and rsus is based on the closing market price of oplinkcommon stock on the date of grant and is amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
stock compensation expense decreased  in fiscal compared to fiscal  mainly due to canceled or fully vested equity awards  partially offset by additional grants of stock options  rsas and rsus to new and existing employees and our board members in fiscal stock compensation expense increased  in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to additional grants to new and existing employees and our board members during fiscal impairment charge and other costs 
there was no impairment charge in fiscal or oplink had goodwill of million at june   which was acquired as part of oplink acquisition of ocp in fiscal and and f and fibercom in fiscal due to the financial liquidity crisis  the economic recession  changes to our operating results and forecasts  and a significant reduction in our market capitalization  in the second quarter of fiscal  and in connection with our annual goodwill impairment testing  we performed an impairment analysis 
as a result  we concluded that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded its implied fair value and recorded an impairment charge of million in fiscal 
table of contents amortization of intangible assets 
amortization expenses related to acquired intangible assets was approximately million for fiscal and million for each of the years ended june  and million was included in the cost of revenues for each of the years ended june   and gain loss on sale or disposal of assets 
the gain on sales or disposal of assets recorded on our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal was  in fiscal  we recognized a gain of  on sales of certain intellectual property and recorded a gain of approximately  on the dissolution of our subsidiaries 
the gain on the dissolution of our subsidiaries primarily reflected the resolution of liabilities related to employee pension and compensation 
we recorded a loss of  on disposal of fixed assets in fiscal in addition  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized a loss of  on a promissory note 
in january  ocp completed its sale to ds ventures  llc  of its property located at woodland hills  california 
the transaction resulted in a gain on sale of assets of million 
the consideration for a portion of the gain was in the form of a promissory note for  payable in july  of the note was secured by a personal guarantee and was recognized as a gain in the third quarter of fiscal  while the remaining balance of the note was deferred 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that the collectibility of the promissory note was unlikely 
as a result  we recognized a loss of  in our consolidated statement of operations during fiscal interest and other income  net years ended percentage years ended percentage june  change change june  change change in thousands  except percentages interest and other income  net the decrease in interest and other income for fiscal compared to fiscal was mainly due to lower yields on our investments

excluding the impact of these two items  interest and other income for fiscal decreased approximately million compared to fiscal the decrease was mainly due to lower yields on our investments 
benefit provision for income taxes 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to taxation in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions 
the taxation of our business is subject to the application of multiple and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions 
our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses  the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region  and the availability of tax credits and carryforwards 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  and the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
consequently  taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could materially impact our tax liability and or our effective income tax rate 
we account for deferred taxes under asc topic  income taxes asc which involves weighing positive and negative evidence concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction 
after considering evidence such as current and cumulative financial reporting incomes  the sources of future taxable income and tax planning strategies  in the fourth quarter of fiscal management concluded that a valuation allowance is no longer required for the us federal deferred tax assets and a portion of our state deferred tax assets 
therefore  we released the valuation allowance against the us federal deferred tax assets and a portion of the state deferred tax assets at the end of the fiscal year based on historical profits and expectations of future results  we determined that there was sufficient positive evidence to support the release of the valuation allowance against our us federal deferred tax assets and a portion of the state deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents the release of the valuation allowance for the year ended june  resulted in a tax benefit of million 
the remaining valuation allowance as of june  relates mainly to state deferred tax assets and certain foreign deferred tax assets 
we recorded tax benefit of million for fiscal as a result of valuation allowance release of million 
excluding the impact of vthe aluation allowance release  our tax provision for fiscal would have been approximately million  compared to million for fiscal the increase was mainly due to higher taxable income from all jurisdictions 
we recorded a tax provision of million in fiscal the decrease in provision for income taxes for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to decreased income from our foreign jurisdictions  partially offset by higher income in us and a higher effective tax rate 
at june   we have approximately million of federal and million of state net operating loss carryforwards 
as of june   the company conducted an internal revenue code section sec 
analysis with respect to its net operating loss and credit carryforwards and determined that there was no limitation 
it is possible that subsequent ownership changes may limit the utilization of these tax attributes 
quarterly results of operations the following table presents our operating results for the last eight quarters 
the information for each of these quarters is unaudited but has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements

you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 
many of the factors that are likely to cause our quarterly results to vary are discussed in this report in item a risk factors 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through cash generated from operating activities and through issuances of equity  which totaled approximately million in aggregate net proceeds  partially offset by million in common stock repurchases  net of proceeds from exercise of stock options  employee stock purchase plan awards and warrants through june  as of june   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million and working capital of million 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalent and short term and long term investment balances will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
we may use cash and cash equivalents from time to time to fund our acquisition of businesses and technologies 
we may be required to raise funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot assure you that such funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our ability to pursue our business strategy and achieve and maintain profitability

the new guidance also expands the required supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
the guidance is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal and will be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is after the effective date 
we do not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial positions  results of operations or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued additional disclosure requirements for fair value measurements

the additional requirements became effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  the adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as this guidance relates only to additional disclosures 
in addition  the guidance requires a roll forward of activities on purchases  sales  issuance  and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs level fair value measurements 
the changes are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years

in various areas  including revenue recognition  stock option and purchase accounting  accounting standards and practices continue to evolve 
we believe that we are in compliance with all of the rules and related guidance as they currently exist 
however  any changes to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in these areas could impact the future accounting of our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates and in foreign currency exchange rates interest rate exposure the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in are subject to market risk 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and corporate bonds 
as of june   all of our short term investments were in certificates of deposit  high quality corporate bonds and government and government agency debt securities 
we invest our excess cash in short term and long term investments to take advantage of higher yields generated by these investments 
we do not hold any instruments for trading purposes 
as of june   we had  gross unrealized losses on our investments classified as available for sale primarily due to decreases in the fair value of these debt securities as a result of changes in market interest rates 
gross unrealized losses on our investments classified as held to maturity were immaterial 
we have the intent and the ability to hold these investments for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery of fair value up to or beyond the initial cost of the investments 
we expect to realize the full value of all of these investments upon maturity 
in addition  we do not believe that we will be required to sell these securities to meet our cash or working capital requirements or contractual or regulatory obligations 
therefore  we have determined that the gross unrealized losses on our debt securities as of june  are temporary in nature 
however  liquidating investments before maturity could have a material impact on our interest earnings 
declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings for our investment portfolio 
the following table summarizes our investment securities in thousands  except percentages for the last two years carrying average rate carrying average rate value at of return at value at of return at june  june  june  june  annualized annualized investment securities cash equivalents variable rate cash equivalents fixed rate short term investments fixed rate long term investments fixed rate total 
table of contents foreign currency exchange rate exposure we operate in the united states  primarily manufacture in china  and the majority of our sales to date have been made in us dollars 
the majority of expenses from our china operations are incurred in the chinese renminbi rmb 
as a result  currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the rmb could cause foreign currency transaction gains or losses that we would recognize in the period incurred 
a fluctuation in the dollar at june  would have an immaterial impact on our net dollar position in outstanding trade receivables and payables 
we use the us dollar as the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements 
any significant revaluation of the rmb may materially and adversely affect our results of operations upon translation of our chinese subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars 
we generate a significant amount of our revenue in rmb and the majority of our labor and manufacturing overhead expenses are in rmb 
additionally  a significant portion of our operating expenses are in rmb 
therefore  a fluctuation in rmb against the us dollar could impact our gross profit  gross profit margin and operating expenses upon translation to us dollars 
a appreciation or depreciation in rmb against the us dollar would have an immaterial impact on our results of operations for fiscal we expect our international revenues to continue to be denominated largely in us dollars 
we also believe that our china operations will likely expand in the future if our business continues to grow 
as a result  we anticipate that we may experience increased exposure to the risks of fluctuating currencies and may choose to engage in currency hedging activities to reduce these risks 
however  we cannot be certain that any such hedging activities will be effective  or available to us at commercially reasonable rates
