item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial review abbott revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short term receivable arrangements 
patent protection and licenses  technological and performance features  and inclusion of abbott products under a contract or by a pharmacy benefit manager most impact which products are sold  price controls  competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products  and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs 
abbott primary products are prescription pharmaceuticals  nutritional products  diagnostic testing products and vascular products 
sales in international markets are approximately percent of consolidated net sales 
continued robust growth of humira after the worldwide launch of additional indications  the acquisitions of solvay pharmaceuticals business solvay pharmaceuticals  piramal healthcare limited healthcare solutions business  and advanced medical optics  inc  the launch of the xience v drug eluting stent  the conclusion of the tap pharmaceutical products inc joint venture  the loss of patent protection for some pharmaceutical products  and the challenging economic environment in many countries around the world have impacted abbott sales  costs and financial position over the last three years 
pharmaceutical research and development is focused on therapeutic areas that include immunology  oncology  neuroscience  pain management  hepatitis c hcv  chronic kidney disease and women health 
in  abbott began the worldwide launch of humira for rheumatoid arthritis  followed by launches for five additional indications  which increased humira worldwide sales to billion in compared to billion in  and billion in abbott forecasts growth in the low teens for worldwide humira sales in abbott is studying additional indications for humira 
substantial research and development and selling support has been and continues to be dedicated to maximizing the worldwide potential of humira 
increased generic competition has resulted in us depakote sales declining from billion in to million in austerity measures implemented by several european countries reduced healthcare spending and affected pharmaceutical pricing in the second half of and that impact is expected to continue for all of in february  abbott acquired solvay pharmaceuticals which provided abbott with a large and complementary portfolio of pharmaceutical products and expanded abbott presence in key global emerging markets 
the acquisition added approximately billion to abbott total sales  primarily outside the us in  abbott recorded approximately million of expense related to the integration of the solvay business and a restructuring plan announced in september to streamline operations  improve efficiencies and reduce costs primarily in certain solvay sites and functions 
the restructuring plan is further described below 
in september abbott completed the acquisition of piramal healthcare solutions business  propelling abbott to market leadership in the indian pharmaceutical market and further accelerating the company growth in emerging markets 
in  abbott nutritional products businesses were reorganized into a worldwide business to better leverage the opportunities available for strong nutritional brands 
significant efforts have been focused on capturing those opportunities  particularly in developing markets where growth has been strong 
in  abbott received fda approval to market the xience v drug eluting stent in the us and in received european union approval 
xience v became the market leading drug eluting stent in the us in the fourth quarter of in june  xience prime  abbott next generation drug eluting stent  received ce mark approval and was launched in europe in august abbott received approval to market xience v in japan in january and xience v became the market leading drug eluting stent in japan in the second quarter of in  the us government passed health care reform legislation which included an increase in medicaid rebate rates and the extension of the rebate to drugs provided through medicaid managed care 
table of contents organizations beginning in the legislation also imposes annual fees to be paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers and medical device companies beginning in and  respectively  as well as additional rebates related to the medicare part d donut hole beginning in in addition to a one time charge of approximately million to reduce deferred tax assets associated with retiree health care liabilities related to the medicare part d retiree drug subsidy  the legislation negatively impacted abbott performance by more than million in and that is expected to increase to more than million in abbott short and long term debt totaled billion at december   largely incurred to finance acquisitions 
operating cash flows in excess of capital expenditures and cash dividends have partially funded acquisitions over the last three years 
at december   abbott long term debt rating was aa by standard and poor corporation and a by moody investors service 
in april  abbott and takeda concluded their tap pharmaceutical products inc tap joint venture  evenly splitting the value and assets of the joint venture in a tax free exchange 
abbott received tap lupron business in exchange for abbott percent ownership in tap 
lupron us results are included in the pharmaceutical products segment beginning in may abbott also receives payments based on specified development  approval and commercial events being achieved with respect to products retained by takeda and payments from takeda based on sales of products retained by takeda 
in  abbott will focus on several key initiatives 
in the pharmaceutical business  abbott will continue to build its global presence  expand its presence in emerging markets and diversify its sources of growth with the solvay pharmaceuticals and piramal healthcare solutions acquisitions 
abbott will also continue maximizing the market potential for humira 
pharmaceutical research and development efforts will continue to focus a significant portion of expenditures on compounds for immunology  oncology  neuroscience  pain management  hcv  chronic kidney disease and women health 
such compounds include one phase iii compound for multiple sclerosis  one phase iii compound and three phase ii compounds in oncology  three phase ii compounds targeting hcv  three phase ii compounds targeting alzheimer disease or cognitive disorders of schizophrenia  two phase ii compounds targeting chronic kidney disease  and one phase ii compound each in women health and pain management 
in the vascular business  abbott will continue to focus on marketing xience prime in europe and other markets  obtaining regulatory review of xience nano  xience prime  and the mitraclip device in the us and a limited european roll out as well as further clinical development of absorb  its bioresorbable vascular scaffold bvs device 
in the other business segments  abbott will focus on developing or acquiring differentiated technologies in higher growth segments of those markets 
critical accounting policies sales rebates approximately percent of abbott consolidated gross revenues are subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that abbott records as reductions of revenues at the time of sale 
most of these rebates and allowances are in the pharmaceutical products segment and the nutritional products segment 
abbott provides rebates to pharmacy benefit management companies  state agencies that administer the federal medicaid program  insurance companies that administer medicare drug plans  state agencies that administer the special supplemental nutrition program for women  infants  and children wic  wholesalers  group purchasing organizations  and other government agencies and private entities 
rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product 
factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate  which customer or government agency price terms apply  and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate 
using historical trends  adjusted for current changes  abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid  and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when abbott records its sale of the product 
settlement of the rebate generally occurs from two to months after sale 
abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs 
rebates and chargebacks 
table of contents charged against gross sales in  and amounted to approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively  or percent  percent and percent  respectively  based on gross sales of approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively  subject to rebate 
a one percentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales by approximately million in abbott considers a one percentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales 
other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately million  million and million for cash discounts in  and  respectively  and million  million and million for returns in  and  respectively 
cash discounts are known within to days of sale  and therefore can be reliably estimated 
returns can be reliably estimated because abbott historical returns are low  and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods 
management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter 
in the domestic nutritional business  management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel 
management has access to several large customers inventory management data  and for other customers  utilizes data from a third party that measures time on the retail shelf 
these sources allow management to make reliable estimates of inventory in the distribution channel 
except for a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the wic business in a state  inventory in the distribution channel does not vary substantially 
management also estimates the states processing lag time based on claims data 
in addition  internal processing time is a factor in estimating the accrual 
in the wic business  the state where the sale is made  which is the determining factor for the applicable price  is reliably determinable 
estimates are required for the amount of wic sales within each state where abbott has the wic business 
external data sources utilized for that estimate are participant data from the us department of agriculture usda  which administers the wic program  participant data from some of the states  and internally administered market research 
the usda has been making its data available for many years 
internal data includes historical redemption rates and pricing data 
at december   abbott had the exclusive wic business in states 
in the domestic pharmaceutical business  the most significant charges against gross sales are for medicaid and medicare rebates  pharmacy benefit manager rebates and wholesaler chargebacks 
in order to evaluate the adequacy of the ending accrual balances  management uses both internal and external data to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time 
external data sources used to estimate the inventory in the distribution channel include inventory levels periodically reported by wholesalers and third party market data purchased by abbott 
management estimates the processing lag time based on periodic sampling of claims data 
to estimate the price rebate percentage  systems and calculations are used to track sales by product by customer and to estimate the contractual or statutory price 
abbott systems and calculations have developed over time as rebates have become more significant  and abbott believes they are reliable 
the following table is an analysis of the four largest rebate accruals  which comprise approximately percent of the consolidated rebate provisions charged against revenues in remaining rebate 
table of contents provisions charged against gross sales are not significant in the determination of operating earnings 
dollars in millions domestic pharmaceutical products domestic nutritionals wic rebates medicaid and medicare rebates pharmacy benefit manager rebates wholesaler chargebacks balance at january  provisions payments balance at december  provisions payments balance at december  provisions payments balance at december  historically  adjustments to prior years rebate accruals have not been material to net income 
abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it  and where possible  works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts 
for medicaid  medicare and other government agency programs  the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations  which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation 
income taxes abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments 
because abbott operates globally  the nature of the audit items are often very complex  and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country 
abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible 
in accordance with the accounting rules relating to the measurement of tax contingencies  in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit  the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position  and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit 
application of these rules requires a significant amount of judgment 
in the us  abbott federal income tax returns through are settled  and the income tax returns for years after are open 
abbott does not record deferred income taxes on earnings reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries 
pension and post employment benefits abbott offers pension benefits and post employment health care to many of its employees 
abbott engages outside actuaries to assist in the determination of the obligations and costs under these programs 
abbott must develop long term assumptions  the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates  discount rates and the expected return on plan assets 
the discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on high quality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits 
the health care cost trend rates represent abbott expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and is a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date 
a difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates  which will not be known for decades  can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs 
negative asset returns in due to poor market conditions and low interest rates have significantly increased actuarial losses for these plans 
at december   pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and credits recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for abbott defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans were losses of billion and million  respectively 
actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method  in accordance with the rules for accounting for post employment benefits 
differences between the expected long term return on plan 
table of contents assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a five year period 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the impact of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate  however  there can be no certainty that a change would be limited to only one percentage point 
valuation of intangible assets abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that abbott records at fair value 
transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows  risk  the cost of capital  terminal values and market participants 
each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 
abbott engages independent valuation experts who review abbott critical assumptions and calculations for acquisitions of significant intangibles 
abbott reviews definite lived intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach 
if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset  the intangible asset is written down to its fair value  which is usually the discounted cash flow amount 
where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset  the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  which relate to in process research and development acquired in a business combination  are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment occurs 
at december   goodwill and intangibles amounted to billion and billion  respectively  and amortization expense for intangible assets amounted to billion in there were no impairments of goodwill in  or litigation abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification no 
 contingencies 
under asc no 
 loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management best estimate of a loss  or when a best estimate cannot be made  a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded 
these estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known  and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known 
accordingly  abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss  and therefore the minimum amount  which could be zero  is recorded 
as information becomes known  either the minimum loss amount is increased  resulting in additional loss provisions  or a best estimate can be made  also resulting in additional loss provisions 
occasionally  a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected 
abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately million to million for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures 
reserves of approximately million have been recorded at december  for these proceedings and exposures 
these reserves represent management best estimate of probable loss  as defined by fasb asc no 
 contingencies 
stock compensation abbott records the fair value of stock options in its results of operations 
since there is no market for trading employee stock options  management must use a fair value method 
there is no certainty that the results of a fair value method would be the value at which employee stock options would be traded for cash 
fair value methods require management to make several assumptions  the most significant of which are the selection of a fair value model  stock price volatility and the average life of an option 
abbott has readily available grant by grant historical activity for several years in its option administration system that it uses in developing some of its assumptions 
abbott uses the black scholes model to value stock options 
abbott uses both historical volatility of its stock price and the implied volatility of traded options to develop the volatility assumptions 
abbott uses the historical grant activity  combined with expectations about future exercise activity  to develop the average life assumptions 
abbott has also used the historical grant data to evaluate whether certain holders of stock options exercised their options differently than other holders and has not found any differentiating pattern among holders

conclusion of tap pharmaceutical products inc joint venture and sale of abbott spine business on april   abbott and takeda concluded their tap pharmaceutical products inc tap joint venture  evenly splitting the value and assets of the joint venture 
abbott exchanged its percent equity interest in tap for the assets  liabilities and employees related to tap lupron business 
subsequent to the conclusion of the joint venture  tap was merged into two takeda entities 
the exchange of abbott investment in tap for tap lupron business resulted in a gain at closing of approximately million 
the internal revenue service has issued a private letter ruling that the transaction qualifies as tax free for us income tax purposes 

table of contents beginning on may   abbott began recording us lupron net sales and costs in its operating results and no longer records income from the tap joint venture 
tap sales of lupron were million for the four months ended april  abbott also receives payments based on specified development  approval and commercial events being achieved with respect to products retained by takeda and payments from takeda based on sales of products retained by takeda  which are recorded by abbott as other income expense  net when the specified event is achieved or as the applicable sales are made 
the exchange transaction was accounted for as a sale of abbott equity interest in tap and as an acquisition of tap lupron business

this plan streamlines operations  improves efficiencies and reduces costs in certain solvay sites and functions as well as in certain abbott and solvay commercial organizations in various countries 
action plans have been identified and most are expected to be implemented within the next two years 
this plan will result in pretax charges of approximately million to million over the life of the plan 
these charges include employee related costs of approximately million  accelerated depreciation and asset write downs of approximately million  and other related exit costs of up to approximately million  mainly related to discontinuation of certain research and development programs and product transfers

this new system is currently under regulatory review for ce mark approval and a filing for fda approval is expected to be submitted in nutrition abbott is focusing its r d spend on six benefit platforms that span the pediatric  adult and performance nutrition areas immunity  cognition  lean body mass  inflammation  metabolism and tolerance 
numerous new products that build on advances in these benefit platforms are currently under development and are expected to be launched in given the diversity of abbott business  its intention to remain a broad based healthcare company and the numerous sources for potential future growth  no individual project is expected to be material to cash flows or results of operations 
factors considered included research and development expenses projected to be incurred for the project compound or device over the next year relative to abbott total research and development expenses as well as qualitative factors  such as marketplace perceptions and impact of a new product on abbott overall market position 
there were no delays in abbott research and development activities that are expected to have a material impact on operations 
while the aggregate cost to complete the numerous pharmaceutical and medical device projects currently in development is expected to be material  the total cost to complete will depend upon abbott ability to successfully complete each project  the rate at which each project advances  and the ultimate timing for completion 
given the potential for significant delays and the high rate of failure inherent in the research and development of new pharmaceutical and medical device products and technologies  it is not possible to accurately estimate the total cost to complete all projects currently in development 
however  abbott plans to continue to manage our portfolio of projects to achieve research and development spend equal to approximately percent to percent of sales each year

the results of the last impairment test indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value except for the medical optics unit 
while the fair value of the medical optics business exceeds its carrying value  extended economic pressure particularly in the lasik surgery business and longer regulatory approval timelines for products currently under development could result in a valuation in the future where the fair value of the medical optics unit has declined below its carrying value  thereby triggering the requirement to estimate the implied fair value of the goodwill and measure for impairment
