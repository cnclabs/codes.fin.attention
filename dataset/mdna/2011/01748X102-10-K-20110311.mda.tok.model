item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis presents factors that had a material effect on our results of operations during the years ended december   and also discussed is our financial position as of december  and you should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements 
please refer to the section entitled special note about forward looking statements for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
results the year proved to be another highly successful year for the company 
for the eighth straight year we remained profitable  with net income of million per share  diluted  compared to net income of million per share  diluted in we remain very pleased with the strength and flexibility of our model 
our continued focus on capacity management  the ability to drive additional ancillary revenues and the execution of our low fixed  high variable cost model has allowed us to weather the high energy price environment in and the financial crisis recession in during we began to see a slow return of our scheduled service average base fare to pre recession levels 
our achievement of a operating margin on million in operating revenue was driven by a increase in scheduled service passengers and a or increase in our scheduled service average base fare to 
although business and international traffic rebounded nicely in the airline industry during the year  both in the terms of demand and average fare for other domestic carriers  the leisure segment continued to lag behind as high unemployment and rising commodity prices continued to impact the us economy 
although we did see strength in our base airfares compared to  we also experienced an increase in energy prices during which was t he primary factor in the overall decrease in profits 
our fuel expense increased million or to million during as compared with these increases were a result of the rebound of crude oil prices from the late and early lows  along with the expansion of crack spreads due to refining constraints 
our average cost per gallon increased to in in addition to a increase in gallons consumed over ancillary revenues continued to be a primary focus during as our total ancillary revenues increased or million to million 
on the air related side  we implemented an open seating policy during the fourth quarter  which drove the take rate and additional revenue on priority boarding and assigned seat assignments since its implementation 
we were particularly pleased with the ancillary revenue production of our third party products which increased million or to million in we continued to add strategic hotel  ski resort  cruise line and other product partners to enhance our offerings to our leisure customer base 
in addition  we were successful in negotiating attractive unit cost rates by amending certain long term agreements with key hotel partners in las vegas 
the company launched a rebranding effort in which included a marketing campaign for a new low price guarantee 
we now provide customers with a guarantee if they are able to find bundled air hotel packages at a lower price than the offered price on our website 
during  our operating expense per passenger  excluding fuel  increased or to 
overall our costs remained in line with our capacity growth and passenger production with the exception of salary and benefits expense and station operations expense 
cost pressure within salary and benefits expense was primarily related to new pilot and flight attendant agreements put into place in the second and third quarters of  respectively 
the station operations expense increase was attributable to increased costs per turn within our leisure destinations which tend to be more expensive to operate than at our small cities 
as capacity is reduced by other carriers within the leisure destinations we serve  airport fixed costs are spread among existing operators 
operating fleet we reached a company milestone during with the introduction of our th aircraft into our fleet 
we ended the year with aircraft in our operating fleet and took delivery of md aircraft and two boeing aircraft under existing purchase agreements 
during  we placed seven md aircraft into service along with the permanent withdrawal of one md aircraft seat md  which increased our operating fleet to aircraft at december  the following table sets forth the number and type of aircraft in service and operated by us at the dates indicated december  december  december  own a lease c total own a b lease total own a b lease total md s mds d total a does not include aircraft owned  but not added to our operating fleet as of the date indicated 
b includes two aircraft subject to capital leases as of december  and december  in september  we exercised early purchase options and took ownership of these two aircraft 
c in february  we exercised purchase options on two aircraft under operating leases 
in october  we took ownership of these aircraft 
d used almost exclusively for fixed fee flying 
network we were able to significantly grow our network and extend our national footprint during we have increased the number of routes into our leisure destinations from at december  to routes at december  we now serve cities including small cities and destinations through our route network which serves states 
our national footprint is well balanced and is not dependent on one particular market or geographic region 
during  we initiated service on seven routes to phoenix  six routes to the los angeles market includes three routes to long beach which commenced in july and expanded our service into las vegas by five routes 
we also expanded our service to myrtle beach by four routes and punta gorda by three routes  which we serve on a limited basis 
these additional routes  along with other network changes resulted in expansion of our route network by routes a increase compared to the end of the following shows the number of destinations and small cities served as of the dates indicated includes cities served seasonally as of december  as of december  as of december  major leisure destinations other leisure destinations small cities served total cities served routes to las vegas routes to orlando airports a routes to phoenix routes to tampa bay st 
petersburg routes to los angeles includes long beach routes to ft 
lauderdale other routes total routes a in february  we have consolidated our orlando operations back to our original operational base at orlando sanford international airport 
trends and uncertainties global crude oil supply concerns and political unrest in oil producing countries continue to drive up energy prices 
uncertainties surrounding the political structure in egypt and libya have driven crude oil prices up by more than per barrel in early we believe energy costs will continue to rise and we will continue to try to offset high fuel prices by managing our capacity to seek to increase base fares 
given the low fixed  high variable cost structure of our model  we are able to flex up our aircraft utilization to maximize profitability during peak periods and flex down when we experience revenue softness or in extremely high fuel cost environments 
as fuel cost fluctuates  we will continue to refine our market mix and adjust capacity as required to seek to achieve desired levels of profitability 
looking ahead  is expected to be a transition year as we continue to invest significant capital into aircraft and aircraft improvements 
in february  we completed the purchase of our third boeing aircraft under the purchase agreement we have for six boeing aircraft 
of the remaining three boeing aircraft under this purchase agreement  we expect to purchase one aircraft in march and purchase the other two aircraft during the fourth quarter of we continue to work on the completion of the certification process to bring on a second fleet type onto our operating certificate 
we have amended our approach to the certification process and plan to enter one boeing aircraft into revenue service during the third quarter 
initially  we expect this aircraft to be used for charters and possibly long haul scheduled service routes 
subsequently  we plan to refocus our efforts on gaining flag carrier status and completing the etops certification process in order to launch service to hawaii in late we have entered into lease agreements with third parties to lease two boeing aircraft we have acquired as of march  the lease term of these agreements are to months 
we have committed to a seat reconfiguration program which will affect our scheduled service revenue fleet 
all our md aircraft excluding our md aircraft will be reconfigured from seats to seats by standardizing the passenger layout accommodations which will be made possible by removing galleys  relocating lavatories and installing slim line  lightweight seats 
we expect this project to start in the third quarter of and take approximately months to complete 
we believe these additional seats will be accretive to earnings as they will allow us to grow capacity without adding incremental aircraft into our operating fleet 
in addition we will realize material costs savings for the addition of these seats in the form of reduced per passenger costs a nd cost per available seat mile 
we currently have eight md aircraft in storage to provide capacity during the seat reconfiguration project and to facilitate future growth during and on march   we borrowed million under a senior secured term loan facility the term loan 
the term loan matures on march  and bears interest based on the london interbank offered rate libor or prime rate with interest payable quarterly or more frequently until maturity 
in addition to the early payments made on existing debt obligations secured by md aircraft and general corporate purposes  proceeds from the term loan will be used to fund future capital expenditure needs  including the acquisition of the three remaining boeing aircraft under purchase agreement and our md aircraft seat reconfiguration program 
our operating revenue our operating revenue comprises of both air travel on a stand alone basis and bundled with hotels  rental cars and other travel related services 
we believe our diversified revenue streams distinguish us from other us airlines and other travel companies 
scheduled service revenue 
scheduled service revenue consists of air fare for nonstop flights between our small city markets and our leisure destinations 
ancillary revenue 
our ancillary revenue is generated from air related charges and third party products 
air related revenue is generated through charges for use of our website to purchase tickets  checked bags  advance seat assignments  priority boarding and other services provided in conjunction with our scheduled air service 
we also generate revenue from third party products through the sale of hotel rooms  ground transportation rental cars and hotel shuttle products  attraction and show tickets and fees we receive from other merchants selling products through our website 
we recognize our ancillary revenues net of amounts paid to wholesale providers  travel agent commissions and credit card processing fees 
fixed fee contract revenue 
our fixed fee contract revenue consists largely of fixed flying agreements with affiliates of caesars entertainment inc formerly harrah s entertainment inc 
that provide for a predictable revenue stream 
we also provide charter service on a seasonal and ad hoc basis to the department of defense and other customers 
other revenue 
other revenue is primarily generated from aircraft and flight equipment leased to third parties 
seasonality 
our business is seasonal in nature with traffic demand historically being weaker in the third quarter and stronger in the first quarter 
our operating revenue is largely driven by perceived product value  advertising and promotional activities and can be adversely impacted during periods with reduced leisure travel spending  such as the back to school season 
our operating expenses a brief description of the items included in our operating expense line items follows 
aircraft fuel expense 
aircraft fuel expense includes the cost of aircraft fuel  fuel taxes  into plane fees and airport fuel flowage  storage or through put fees 
under the majority of our fixed fee contracts  our customer reimburses us for fuel costs 
these amounts are netted against our fuel expense 
salary and benefits expense 
salary and benefits expense includes wages  salaries  and employee bonuses  sales commissions for in flight personnel  as well as expenses associated with employee benefit plans and employer payroll taxes 
station operations expense 
station operations expense includes the fees charged by airports for the use or lease of airport facilities and fees charged by third party vendors for ground handling services  commissary expenses and other related services such as deicing of aircraft 
maintenance and repairs expense 
maintenance and repairs expense includes all parts  materials and spares required to maintain our aircraft 
also included are fees for repairs performed by third party vendors 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense includes all advertising  promotional expenses  travel agent commissions and credit card discount fees associated with the sale of scheduled service and air related charges 
aircraft lease rentals expense 
aircraft lease rentals expense consists of the cost of leasing aircraft under operating leases with third parties 
also included are maintenance deposits when not considered part of maintenance and repair expense as discussed under critical accounting policies and estimates below 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense includes the depreciation of all fixed assets  including aircraft that we own and amortization of aircraft that we operated under capital leases 
other expense 
other expense includes the cost of passenger liability insurance  aircraft hull insurance and all other insurance policies except for employee welfare insurance 
additionally  this expense includes loss on disposals of aircraft and other equipment disposals  travel and training expenses for crews and ground personnel  facility lease expenses  professional fees  personal property taxes and all other administrative and operational overhead expenses not included in other line items above 
results of operations compared to the table below presents our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue for the periods presented year ended december  total operating revenue operating expenses aircraft fuel salary and benefits station operations maintenance and repairs sales and marketing aircraft lease rentals depreciation and amortization other total operating expenses operating margin operating revenue our operating revenue increased to million in from million in primarily due to a increase in scheduled service revenue and a increase in ancillary revenue 
scheduled service revenue and ancillary revenue increases were primarily driven by a increase in scheduled service passengers on a increase in scheduled service departures 
increased passenger demand from what we believe to be an overall strengthening in the us economy allowed us to increase our average base airfare or to in from system available seat miles asms increased by as a result of a increase in system departures and a increase in system average stage length 
operating revenue per asm rasm increased from during to during as the rate of increase in total operating revenue slightly exceeded the increase in our capacity 
scheduled service revenue 
scheduled service revenue increased to million for  up from million in the increase was primarily driven by a increase in the number of scheduled service passengers  along with an increase in the scheduled service average base fare for compared to passenger growth was driven by a increase in the number of scheduled service departures and a slight increase in scheduled service load factor  up percentage points to 
the increase in departure growth was driven by the increase in routes to our phoenix market  los angeles market with commencement of flying to long beach in july and route expansion of our s easonal service during to myrtle beach and punta gorda 
overall  our route network expanded from routes served at december  to served at december ancillary revenue 
ancillary revenue increased to million in up from million in  driven by a increase in scheduled service passengers and a increase in ancillary revenue per scheduled passenger from to 
the following table details ancillary revenue per scheduled service passenger from air related charges and third party products year ended december  percentage change air related charges third party products total ancillary revenue per scheduled service passenger the increase in air related charges per passenger was primarily attributable to higher baggage fees and booking fees in the comparable periods 
we increased baggage fees  which currently range between and per checked bag  depending on the flight segment  to comparable industry levels 
in addition  we transitioned to an open seating model for customers who do not purchase our assigned seat product 
this resulted in an increase in take rates and overall revenue production for our priority boarding and assigned seat products 
ancillary revenue from third party products increased in on a per passenger basis as a result of increased volume of sales per passenger and increased margins on the sale of hotel rooms compared to the following table details the calculation of ancillary revenue from third party products 
third party products consist of revenue from the sale of hotel rooms  ground transportation rental cars and hotel shuttle products  attraction and show tickets and fees we receive from other merchants selling products through our website year ended december  in thousands change gross ancillary revenue third party cost of goods sold transaction costs a ancillary revenue third party products as percent of gross ancillary revenue third party pp a includes credit card fees and travel agency commissions fixed fee contract revenue 
fixed fee contract revenue decreased to million during from million for increased flying for the department of defense during was more than offset by the cessation in of fixed fee flying under the cuban family charter program and under an agreement with beau rivage resorts  inc fixed fee flying under our agreement with caesars entertainment inc formerly harrah s entertainment inc 
partially offset this decrease as the number of block hours flown under the agreement increased by for compared to other revenue 
we generated other revenue of million for compared to million for during which other revenue was primarily from flight equipment leased to third parties 
all of these leases were terminated by the end of third quarter operating expenses our operating expenses increased to million for compared to million in we primarily evaluate our expense management by comparing our costs per passenger and per asm across different periods which enable us to assess trends in each expense category 
the following table presents operating expense per passenger for the indicated periods per passenger costs 
the table also presents operating expense per passenger  excluding fuel  which represents operating expenses  less aircraft fuel expense  divided by the number of passengers carried 
this statistic provides management and investors the ability to measure and monitor our cost performance absent fuel price volatility 
both the cost and availability of fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control 
year ended december  percentage change aircraft fuel salaries and benefits station operations maintenance and repairs sales and marketing aircraft lease rentals depreciation and amortization other operating expense per passenger operating expense per passenger  excluding fuel despite an increase of in system average stage length and a reduction in average daily departures per aircraft  operating expense per passenger  excluding fuel  increased only from in to in an increase in salary and benefits expense per passenger was the principal contributor to the increase 
the increase in average fuel cost per gallon of and the longer stage length resulted in a increase in fuel expense per passenger from to 
the following table presents unit costs  defined as operating expense per asm casm  for the indicated periods 
the table also presents operating casm  excluding fuel  which represents operating expenses  less aircraft fuel expense  divided by available seat miles 
as on a per passenger basis  excluding fuel on an asm basis provides management and investors the ability to measure and monitor our cost performance absent fuel price volatility 
year ended december  percentage change aircraft fuel salary and benefits station operations maintenance and repairs sales and marketing aircraft lease rentals depreciation and amortization other operating expense per asm casm casm  excluding fuel aircraft fuel expense 
aircraft fuel expense increased million or to million for  up from million in  primarily driven by a increase in the system average cost per gallon from to 
system departure growth of and a increase in system average stage length for resulted in a increase in gallons consumed  which increased from million to million 
salary and benefits expense 
salary and benefits expense increased to million for up from million for excluding accrued employee bonus expense and stock compensation expense  salary and benefits expense increased attributable to a increase in salary and benefits expense per full time equivalent employee and a increase in the number of full time equivalent employees from december  to december  we entered into new compensation agreements with our pilots and flight attendants which went into effect in may and july respectively 
these new compensation arrangements accounted for the majority of the salary and benefits expense per full tim e equivalent employees year over year change 
in addition to these agreements  we experienced higher medical premiums and increased k contributions which are offset by a reduction in employee accrued bonus expense due to a lower level of profitability compared to station operations expense 
station operations expense increased to million in compared to million in as a result of a in system departures and a increase in station operations expense per departure 
our expense per departure increase is primarily attributable to increased airport and common use fees at some of our leisure destination airports 
as capacity is reduced at these airports  which has been the case over the past two years  airports reallocate costs among remaining carriers 
in addition we operated out of orlando international airport since the first quarter which has approximately higher operating costs than those at orlando sanford internati onal airport 
maintenance and repairs expense 
maintenance and repairs expense increased to million for compared to million in as the average number of aircraft in service increased from aircraft during to during the the timing of maintenance events may cause our maintenance and repairs expense to vary significantly from period to period 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense increased to million in compared to million in due to higher credit card transaction costs associated with the increase in scheduled service and ancillary revenue 
the increase in transaction costs were partially offset by reductions in credit card rates and small city advertising expenses 
aircraft lease rentals expense 
aircraft lease rentals expense decreased  from million for to million in for all of and a majority of  we operated four leased aircraft 
in october we took ownership of two of our leased aircraft though the exercise of purchase options 
we continue to have two aircraft under operating leases remaining in our fleet at the end of depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million for from million for  an increase of  driven by a increase in the number of operating aircraft 
we ended with aircraft in revenue service as compared with in additionally  depreciation and amortization expense excluding aircraft and aircraft related parts increased as we continued to invest in our ground service equipment and information technology infrastructure 
other expense 
other expense increased to million for compared to million for  attributable to an increase in administrative expenses associated with our growth  such as facility rent for our corporate headquarters and aircraft insurance 
in addition  we incurred pre operating expenses associated with the certification process for the boeing aircraft type which began in the first quarter of expenses related to this process were approximately million in these increases were offset by a lower loss from the disposal of assets which were million in and million in other income expense other income expense decreased from a net other expense of million for  to a net other expense of million for the change is primarily attributable to a reduction in interest expense due to lower debt balances partially offset by a reduction of interest income earned on cash balances in compared to income tax expense our effective income tax rate was for compared to for the lower effective tax rate for was largely due to the geographic mix of our flying and the impact this had on the state income tax portion of the tax provision 
while we expect our tax rate to be fairly consistent in the near term  it will tend to vary depending on recurring items such as the amount of income we earn in each state and the state tax rate applicable to such income 
discrete items particular to a given year may also affect our effective tax rates 
compared to the table below presents our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue for the periods presented year ended december  total operating revenue operating expenses aircraft fuel salary and benefits station operations maintenance and repairs sales and marketing aircraft lease rentals depreciation and amortization other total operating expenses operating margin we recorded total operating revenue of million  income from operations of million and net income of million for by comparison  in  we recorded total operating revenue of million  income from operations of million and net income of million 
we achieved a operating margin for with system growth in departures of and asms of  despite a reduction in scheduled service revenue of per passenger year over year 
operating revenue our operating revenue increased to million in from million in primarily due to a increase in ancillary revenue from air related charges and a increase in scheduled service revenue  partially offset by a decrease in fixed fee contract revenue 
the ancillary revenue from air related charges and scheduled service revenue increases were primarily driven by a increase in the number of scheduled service passengers 
system asms increased by as a result of a increase in system departures 
rasm decreased by from cents during to cents during the decrease was mainly attributable to a reduction in our scheduled service average base fare offset by an increase in ancillary revenue per passenger 
we decreased scheduled service base fares to maintain load factor in the face of industry wide lower fares and adverse economic conditions 
scheduled service revenue 
scheduled service revenue increased to million for  from million in the increase was a result of a increase in the number of scheduled service passengers offset by a decrease in the scheduled service average base fare of from in to in passenger growth was driven primarily as a result of a increase in departures from  to  in significant contributors to the departure growth were the addition of  departures attributable to our new service to los angeles not operated in and an increase of  departures from route expansion to our phoenix market 
we offered service into phoenix on routes at december  compared to routes at december  remaining departure growth is a result of increased frequency of flying to our other major leisure destinations and departures to new limited service destinations 
our route network consisted of routes at december   an increase from routes at december  ancillary revenue 
ancillary revenue increased to million in up from million in  driven by a increase in scheduled service passengers and a increase in ancillary revenue per scheduled passenger from to 
the following table details ancillary revenue per scheduled service passenger from air related charges and third party products year ended december  percentage change air related charges third party products total ancillary revenue per scheduled service passenger on a per passenger basis  and of our total ancillary revenues consist of air related charges for and  respectively 
the increase in air related charges per passenger was primarily attributable to higher baggage fees as we increased fees to comparable industry levels  an increase in our customer convenience fee  and the effect of a full year of our priority boarding product rolled out in october we increased our customer convenience fee from to in january and to in july third party products declined on a per passenger basis but increased slightly in absolute terms due to las vegas contributing a smaller percentage of our total passengers 
our third party products revenue per passenger for las vegas is higher than our other destinations due to large volume of hotel rooms we sell in las vegas 
the following table details the calculation of ancillary revenue from third party products 
third party products consist of revenue from the sale of hotel rooms  ground transportation rental cars and hotel shuttle products  attraction and show tickets and fees we receive from other merchants selling products through our website year ended december  in thousands change gross ancillary revenue third party cost of goods sold transaction costs a ancillary revenue third party products as percent of gross ancillary revenue third party pp a includes credit card fees and travel agency commissions during  we generated gross revenue of million from third party products  which resulted in net revenue of million 
the majority of the gross revenue was generated from the sale of over  hotel room nights at our leisure destinations packaged to our customers with scheduled air service 
fixed fee contract revenue 
fixed fee contract revenue decreased to million during from million for as we had  block hours of fixed fee flying in compared to  in the decrease is primarily due to a decline in block hours flown under the caesars entertainment inc formerly harrah s entertainment inc fixed fee agreement partially offset by a increase in other fixed fee flying programs for reduction in the caesars fixed fee revenues was also attributable to the impact of a new contract which went into effect january  under the modified caesars contract  caesars reimburses us for the entire amount of fuel costs incurred 
the per block hour r ate we charge caesars is therefore reduced from the rate we charged under the previous caesars contracts under which we had been responsible for a portion of the fuel expenses 
the reno program with caesars was closed in november new fixed fee flying for included agreements for the cuban family charter program  which began in june  flying under an agreement with beau rivage resorts  inc  and fixed fee flying for the department of defense which began in april the cuban family charter program fixed fee flying was permanently ceased in october and the agreement with beau rivage resorts  inc ended in december other revenue 
we generated other revenue of million and million during and  respectively 
the revenue was primarily generated as a result of our april purchase of six md aircraft and three engines on lease to another airline 
the six purchased aircraft have since been returned to us  with all of these aircraft having been placed in service as of december  with the return of all of these aircraft  we are not presently generating significant other revenue 
operating expenses despite a significant increase in departures  our operating expenses decreased by to million in compared to million in as the reduction in fuel expense more than offset expense increases in other line items resulting from increased service and other factors 
the following table presents operating expense per passenger and operating expense per passenger  excluding fuel for the indicated periods per passenger costs 
year ended december  percentage change aircraft fuel salaries and benefits station operations maintenance and repairs sales and marketing aircraft lease rentals depreciation and amortization other operating expense per passenger operating expense per passenger  excluding fuel our per passenger costs decreased primarily due to a decrease in fuel expense per passenger as a result of a increase in the number of system passengers and a reduction in system average cost per gallon for compared to the following table presents the unit costs of casm and operating casm  excluding fuel for the indicated periods 
year ended december  percentage change aircraft fuel salary and benefits station operations maintenance and repairs sales and marketing aircraft lease rentals depreciation and amortization other operating expense per asm casm casm  excluding fuel aircraft fuel expense 
despite our significant year over year expansion of service  aircraft fuel expense decreased to million for  down from million for  driven by a decrease in the system average cost per gallon to from 
system gallons consumed increased to million from million attributable to our system departure growth 
salary and benefits expense 
salary and benefits expense increased to million for up from million for mainly as a result of a significant increase in accrued employee bonus expense and an increase in the number of full time equivalent employees 
the increase in accrued employee bonus expense was driven by the significant year over year increase in operating income 
we employed approximately  full time equivalent employees at december  compared to  at december   a increase in line with our fleet growth from an average number of aircraft in service of in to in excluding accrued employee bonus expense  stock compensation expense and othe r incentives  our salary and benefits expense per average full time equivalent employee increased by only year over year 
station operations expense 
station operations expense increased to million in compared to million in principally attributable to the impact of increased scheduled service departures of 
our station operations expense on a per departure basis increased by only year over year 
maintenance and repairs expense 
maintenance and repairs expense increased  to million for up from million for as the average number of aircraft in service increased from in to in the increase is primarily attributable to scheduled heavy aircraft maintenance checks performed and impact of the growth in our fleet on the repair of rotable aircraft parts for compared to  a non recurring inventory adjustment related to low value usage expendables during the first quarter of  offset by a decrease in the engine maintenance expense from less expensive engine maintenance events 
in comparison with  our scheduled heavy aircraft maintenance checks increased bo th in the number of events and average expense per event  with percentage increases of and  respectively 
our average maintenance and repairs expense per aircraft per month increased from approximately  in to approximately  in sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense increased to million in compared to million in as a result of advertising expenses associated with entrance into new markets including the new major leisure destination of los angeles which launched service in may aircraft lease rentals expense 
aircraft lease rentals expense decreased by to million in down from million in in each of and  we had four aircraft under operating lease agreements 
in  the average expense per aircraft was lower due to the purchase in of two aircraft under lease being replaced by two less expensive aircraft which we began leasing in depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million for from million for  an increase of  as the number of aircraft owned including those leased to a third party or subject to capital lease  increased from as of december  to as of december  the increase was also attributable to the impact of lowering the depreciable lives of our engines at the beginning of and additional depreciation related to non aircraft equipment purchases during other expense 
other expense increased to million for compared to million for the increase is due to an increase of million in losses attributable to dispositions of engines and a reduction in the value of engines held on consignment 
another contributing factor to the increase is from other expenses associated with our growth  such as rent for our company headquarters and aircraft insurance 
other income expense other income expense increased  from a net other expense of million for  to a net other expense of million for the increased expense is primarily attributable to a reduction of interest income earned on cash balances in compared to the same period of partially offset by a reduction in interest expense due to lower debt balances 
income tax expense our effective income tax rate was for compared to for the higher effective tax rate for was largely due to the geographic mix from our flying and the impact this had on the state income tax portion of the tax provision 
while we expect our tax rate to be fairly consistent in the near term  it will tend to vary depending on recurring items such as the amount of income we earn in each state and the state tax rate applicable to such income 
discrete items particular to a given year may also affect our tax rates 
liquidity and capital resources during  our primary source of funds was cash generated by our operations 
our operating cash flows have allowed us to maintain a high level of liquidity while growing our fleet and meeting our short term obligations 
our future capital needs are generally for the purchase of additional aircraft for which we had million of obligations as of december  under existing aircraft purchase agreements 
in addition  our capital needs include a seat reconfiguration program for our md aircraft fleet which is expected to start in the third quarter of on march   we borrowed million under a senior secured term loan facility term loan 
in addition to the early payments made on existing debt obligations secured by md aircraft  proceeds from t he term loan will be used for funding of future capital expenditure programs and general corporate purposes 
we believe we have adequate liquidity resources through our operating cash flows and the proceeds from the term loan to meet our future capital obligations 
current liquidity our total cash  including cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments  totaled million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
restricted cash represents credit card deposits  cash collateral against notes payable  escrowed funds under our fixed fee flying contracts  and cash collateral against letters of credit required by hotel partners for guaranteed room availability  airports and certain other parties 
short term investments represent marketable securities which are available for sale 
during  our restricted cash balance increased by million primarily from the cash collateral associated with the loan secured by two boeing aircraft 
an increase in the number of letters of credit and higher amounts on a number of existing letters of credit issued to our hotel vendors and some airports resulted in an increase in the restricted cash balance at december  under our fixed fee flying contracts  we require our customers to prepay for flights to be provided by us 
the prepayments are escrowed until the flight is completed 
prepayments are recorded as restricted cash and a corresponding amount is recorded as air traffic liability 
sources and uses of cash operating activities 
during  our operating activities provided million of cash compared to million during we generated more cash from operating activities in than as a result of higher net income and a higher increase in our air traffic liability compared to the previous year end 
in addition  cash from operating activities in was reduced by the prepayment of million for access to hotel rooms for sale through an agreement with one of our key las vegas hotel partners 
investing activities 
during  our investing activities provided million compared to the use of million during cash provided in investing activities of million during was primarily due to the proceeds of million from maturities of short term investments  net of purchases  offset by million of cash used in the purchase of property and equipment  including pre delivery deposits 
purchases of property and equipment during consisted of cash purchases of aircraft and induction costs associated with aircraft including payment of pre delivery deposits on four undelivered boeing aircraft 
during  we used million for the purchase of short term investments  net of maturities  and another million for the purchase of property and equipment 
financing activities 
during  we used million in cash for financing activities compared to the use of million during we primarily used cash for the repurchase of our common stock in open market purchases of million  payment on our debt and capital lease obligations of million and the payment of cash dividends to shareholders of million during during  we used million to repurchase our common stock and million for payment of our debt and capital lease obligations 
the cash used in financing activities for both periods was offset by proceeds from the issuance of notes payable associated with a million secured loan during the third quar ter of and a million secured loan during the second quarter of debt our long term debt obligations declined from million as of december  to million as of december  as of december   we had secured debt financing on in service md aircraft and two boeing aircraft which have yet to be added to our in service fleet
