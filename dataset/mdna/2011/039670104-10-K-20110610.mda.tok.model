item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and note thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
executive level overview we continued our improvement in net sales and profitability in fiscal fiscal net sales increased to million from million in fiscal fiscal net earnings were million or per diluted share compared to a net earnings of million or per diluted share in fiscal the increase in net sales was mainly due to increased snowmobile sales and snowmobile related parts  garments and accessory sales 
during the fiscal year  gross margins improved basis points  operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased to  and operating profits increased to million from million 
in addition  we improved our liquidity by ending the fiscal year with million in cash and short term investments driven by a reduction in factory inventory 
industry wide retail sales of snowmobiles in north america increased in fiscal and  similar to last year  snowmobile retail sales out performed many other recreational vehicle categories in north america 
while retail sales of snowmobiles are certainly affected by the economic environment  they are also impacted by snow conditions 
in the us  snow conditions were generally good for the fourth year in a row  which helped snowmobile retail sales out perform many other recreational vehicle categories 
during fiscal we lost two points of market share in north america  however  we were successful in reducing north american dealer inventories 
our focus for fiscal will be regaining market share with our exciting model line up 
industry wide retail sales of atvs again declined throughout the year driven by continued uncertainties in the economy  relatively weak consumer confidence and unemployment figures at near historic levels 
we expect these same factors to impact retail sales of atvs during fiscal as well 
our focus for fiscal will again be gaining market share in certain segments and reducing dealer inventories 
during fiscal  our atv business gained market share in certain segments in north america and our dealer inventories declined by over the prior year 
in view of the current north american economic environment  we do not expect atv retail sales to improve significantly over last year  although we may see a slight uptick in the atv market by the end of fiscal if the economy strengthens

fiscal net earnings were million or per diluted share compared to a net loss of million or per share for fiscal net earnings as a percent of net sales were and in fiscal and  respectively 
the increased earnings are attributable to the reduction in our cost structure through aggressive expense controls  manufacturing efficiencies and low cost sourcing which led to higher gross margins and operating profits in fiscal inflation inflation historically has not significantly impacted our business 
we generally have been able to offset the impact of increasing costs through a combination of productivity gains and product price increases 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of reported assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the 
table of contents consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
we reviewed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and believe the following are the most critical accounting policies that could have an effect on our reported results 
these critical accounting policies and estimates have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue and provide for estimated marketing and sales incentive costs when products are shipped to dealers and distributors pursuant to their order  the price is fixed and collection is reasonably assured 
we have agreements with finance companies to repurchase products repossessed up to certain limits 
our financial exposure to repurchase products is limited to the difference between the amount paid to the finance company and the resale value of the repossessed products 
historically  we have not incurred material losses as a result of repurchases nor has it provided a financial reserve for repurchases 
adverse changes in retail sales could cause this situation to change 
marketing and sales incentive costs we provide for various marketing and sales incentive costs which are offered to our dealers and consumers at the later of when the revenue is recognized or when the marketing and sales incentive program is approved and communicated 
examples of these costs include dealer and consumer rebates  dealer floorplan financing assistance and other incentive and promotion programs 
adverse market conditions resulting in lower than expected retail sales or the matching of competitor programs could cause accrued marketing and incentive costs to materially increase if we authorize and communicate new programs to our dealers 
we estimate marketing and sales incentive costs based on expected usage and historical experience 
the accrual for marketing and sales incentive costs at march  and was million and million  respectively  and is included in accrued marketing in our balance sheet 
the increase in this accrual was a result of current announced and communicated marketing and sales incentive programs and retail market conditions 
historically  marketing and sales incentive program expenses have been within our expectations 
to the extent current experience differs with previous estimates the accrued liability for marketing and sales incentives is adjusted accordingly 
product warranties we generally provide a limited warranty to the owner of snowmobiles for months from the date of consumer registration and for months on atvs 
we provide for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale based on historical rates and trends and makes subsequent adjustments to their estimate as actual claims become known or the amounts are determinable 
adverse changes in actual warranty costs compared to our initial estimates could cause accrued warranty costs to materially change 
the accrual for warranty costs was million at march  and historically  actual warranty costs have been within our expectations 
inventories our inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market  with cost based on a first in  first out basis 
we periodically assess inventories for obsolescence and potential excess 
this assessment is based primarily on assumptions and estimates regarding future production demands  anticipated changes in technology or design  historical and expected future sales patterns 
our inventories consist of materials and products that are subject to changes in our planned production of future snowmobile and atv products and competitive market conditions which may cause lower of cost or market adjustments to our finished goods inventory 
if market conditions or future demand are less favorable than our current expectations  additional inventory write downs or reserves may be required  which could have an adverse effect on our reported results in the period the adjustments are made 
inventory items that are identified as obsolete or excess are fully reserved on our balance sheet and are generally scrapped 
historically  inventory obsolescence and potential excess costs adjustments have been within our expectations 

table of contents product liability and litigation we are subject to product liability claims and other litigation in the normal course of business 
we insure for product liability claims although we retain a self insured retention accrual within the balance sheet caption insurance within accrued expenses 
the estimated costs resulting from any losses over insured amounts are charged to operating expenses when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably determinable 
we utilize historical trends and other analysis to assist in determining the appropriate loss 
adverse changes in the final determination of product liability or other claims made against us could have a material impact on our financial condition 
historically  actual product liability and litigation costs have been within our expectations 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation based on certain assumption inputs within the black scholes model 
these assumption inputs are used to determine an estimated fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant and require subjective judgment 
because employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the employee stock options 
we assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate estimated fair value of stock based compensation on a regular basis 
circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time  which could result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies and thereby materially impact our fair value determination 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  the amount of compensation expense may differ significantly from what was recorded in the current period 
liquidity and capital resources the seasonality of our snowmobile and atv production cycles generates significant fluctuations in our working capital requirements during the year 
the following table represents sales and ending inventories by each quarter in the fiscal years ended march  and first second third fourth total snowmobile atv pg a total sales inventories snowmobile atv pg a total sales inventories as a result of our better matching of atv production to wholesale and retail demand for atv units  our finished goods inventory balance decreased as of march  compared with march  historically  we have financed our working capital requirements out of available cash balances at the beginning and end of the production cycle and with short term bank borrowings during the middle of the cycle 
we believe current available cash and cash generated from operations together with working capital financing through our available 
table of contents line of credit will provide sufficient funds to finance operations on a short and long term basis 
however  there can be no assurance that adequate working capital financing arrangements will remain available or that the costs and other terms of such new financing arrangements will not be significantly less favorable to us than has historically been available 
cash and short term investments cash and short term investments increased to  at march  from  at march  because of improved profitability and working capital management 
our cash balances traditionally peak early in the fourth quarter and then decrease as working capital requirements increase when our snowmobile and spring atv production cycles begin 
our investment objectives are first  safety of principal and second  rate of return 
financing arrangements and cash flows we have operated since november under a  secured bank credit agreement for the documentary and stand by letters of credit and for working capital purposes 
we may borrow up to  during june through november and up to  during all other months of the fiscal year 
the total letters of credit issued at march  were  of which  was issued to suzuki for engine and service parts purchases 
we have agreements with ge commercial distribution finance in the united states and tcf commercial finance canada in canada to provide snowmobile and atv floorplan financing for our dealers 
these agreements improve our liquidity by financing dealer purchases of products without requiring substantial use of our working capital 
we are paid by the floorplan companies shortly after shipment and as part of our marketing programs  we pay the floorplan financing of our dealers for certain set time periods depending on the size of a dealer s order 
the financing agreements require repurchase of repossessed new and unused units and set limits upon our potential liability for annual repurchases 
the aggregate potential liability was approximately  at march  we have incurred no material losses under these agreements 
we believe current available cash and cash generated from operations provide sufficient funding in the event there is a requirement to perform under these guarantee and repurchase agreements 
in fiscal  we invested  in capital expenditures 
we expect that capital expenditures will increase to approximately  in fiscal since  we have repurchased over  shares of our common stock 
there is approximately  remaining on the january repurchase authorization 
we believe that cash generated from operations and available cash will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements on a short and long term basis 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant future contractual obligations at march  in millions payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations we have outstanding purchase obligations with suppliers and vendors at march  for raw materials and other supplies as part of the normal course of business 

table of contents certain information concerning off balance sheet arrangements as of march   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we are  therefore  not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange rates and interest rates during fiscal  approximately of our cost of sales was purchased from japanese yen denominated suppliers 
the majority of these purchases were made from suzuki  which supplies engines for our snowmobiles 
we have an agreement with suzuki for snowmobile engine purchases to share the impact of fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the japanese yen above and below a fixed range contained in the agreement 
this agreement renews annually 
during fiscal  the exchange rate fluctuation between the us dollar and the japanese yen had a modest negative impact on our operating results

the carrying amount of available for sale debt securities approximate related fair value and the associated market risk is not deemed to be significant 
we are a party to a secured bank line of credit arrangement under which we currently may borrow an aggregate of up to  the total letters of credit issued  under this arrangement  at march  were  of which  was issued to suzuki for engine and service parts purchases 
interest is charged at variable rates based on either libor or prime 
because the interest rate risk related to the line of credit is not deemed to be significant  we do not actively manage this exposure
