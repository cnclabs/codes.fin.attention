critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and all known facts and circumstances that we believe are relevant 
actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
we believe the accounting policies discussed below to be most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery or performance has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from products sold directly to end users  or to distributors that are not entitled to price concessions and rights of return  is generally recognized when title and risk of loss has passed to the buyer which typically occurs upon shipment 
all shipping costs are charged to cost of product revenue 
revenue from products sold to distributors with agreements allowing for stock rotations is generally recognized upon shipment 
reserves for stock rotations are estimated based primarily on historical experience and provided for at the time of shipment 
for products sold to distributors with agreements allowing for price concessions and stock rotation rights product returns  we recognize revenue based on when the distributor reports that it has sold the product to its customer 
our recognition of such distributor sell through is based on point of sales reports received from the distributor which establishes a customer  quantity and final price 
revenue is not recognized upon our shipment of the product to the distributor  since  due to certain forms of price concessions  the sales price is not substantially fixed or determinable at the time of shipment 
price concessions are recorded when incurred  which is generally at the time the distributor sells the product to its customer 
additionally  these distributors have stock rotation rights permitting them to return products to us  up to a specified amount for a given period of time 
when the distributor reports that it has sold product to its customer  our sales price to the distributor is fixed 
once we receive the point of sales reports from the distributor  it has satisfied all the requirements for revenue recognition with respect to the product reported as sold and any product returns stock rotation and price concession rights that the distributor has under its distributor agreement with us lapsed at that time 
pursuant to our distributor agreements  older  end of life and certain other products are generally sold with no right of return and are not eligible for price concessions 
for these products  revenue is recognized upon shipment and title transfer assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
at the time of shipment to distributors  we record a trade receivable for the selling price since there is a legally enforceable right to payment  we relieve inventory for the carrying value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributor and until revenue is recognized  we record the gross margin in deferred margin on sale to distributors  a component of current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
deferred margin on the sale to distributor effectively represents the gross margin on the sale to the distributor 
however  the amount of gross margin we recognize in future periods will be less than the originally recorded deferred margin on sales to distributor as a result of negotiated price concessions 
we sell each item in our product price book to all of our distributors worldwide at a relatively uniform list price 
however  distributors resell our products to end customers at a very broad range of individually negotiated price points based on customer  product  quantity  geography  competitive pricing and other factors 
the majority of our distributors resales are priced at a discount from the list price 
often  under these circumstances  we remit back to the distributor a portion of their original purchase price after the resale transaction is completed 
thus  a portion of the deferred margin on the sale to distributor balance represents a portion of distributors original purchase price that will be remitted back to the distributor in the future 
the wide range and variability of negotiated price concessions granted to the distributors does not allow us to accurately estimate the portion of the balance in the deferred margin on the sale to distributors that will be remitted back to the distributors 
in addition to the above  we also reduce the deferred margin by anticipated or determinable future price protections based on revised price lists  if any 

table of contents we derive revenue from the license of our internally developed intellectual property ip 
we enter into ip licensing agreements that generally provide licensees the right to incorporate our ip components in their products with terms and conditions that vary by licensee 
revenue earned under contracts with our licensees is classified as licensing revenue 
our license fee arrangements generally include multiple deliverables and for multiple deliverable arrangements  we follow the guidance in financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standard codification asc no 
 multiple element arrangements revenue recognition  to determine whether there is more than one unit of accounting 
to the extent that the deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting  we allocate the total fee on such arrangements to the individual units of accounting using the residual method  if objective and reliable evidence of fair value does not exist for delivered elements 
we then recognize revenue for each unit of accounting depending on the nature of the deliverable s comprising the unit of accounting in accordance with the revenue recognition criteria mentioned above 
the ip licensing agreements generally include a nonexclusive license for the underlying ip 
fees under these agreements generally include a license fees relating to our ip  b support  typically for one year  and c royalties payable following the sale by our licensees of products incorporating the licensed technology 
the license for our ip has standalone value and can be used by the licensee without support 
further  objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for support 
accordingly  license and support fees are each treated as separate units of accounting 
certain licensing agreements provide for royalty payments based on agreed upon royalty rates 
such rates can be fixed or variable depending on the terms of the agreement 
the amount of revenue we recognize is determined based on a time period or on the agreed upon royalty rate  extended by the number of units shipped by the customer 
to determine the number of units shipped  we rely upon actual royalty reports from our customers when available and rely upon estimates in lieu of actual royalty reports when we have a sufficient history of receiving royalties from a specific customer for us to make an estimate based on available information from the licensee such as quantities held  manufactured and other information 
these estimates for royalties necessarily involve the application of management judgment 
as a result of our use of estimates  period to period numbers are trued up in the following period to reflect actual units shipped 
such true ups have not been significant 
in cases where royalty reports and other information are not available to allow us to estimate royalty revenue  we recognize revenue only when royalty reports are received 
for contracts related to licenses of our technology that involve significant modification  customization or engineering services  we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc no 
 construction type and production type contracts revenue recognition 
revenues derived from such license contracts are accounted for using the percentage of completion method 
we determine progress to completion based on input measures using labor hours incurred by our engineers 
the amount of revenue recognized is based on the total contract fees and the percentage of completion achieved 
estimates of total project requirements are based on prior experience of customization  delivery and acceptance of the same or similar technology and are reviewed and updated regularly by management 
if there is significant uncertainty about customer acceptance  or the time to complete the development or the deliverables by either party  we apply the completed contract method 
if application of the percentage of completion method results in recognizable revenue prior to an invoicing event under a customer contract  we recognize the revenue and record an unbilled receivable assuming collectability is reasonably assured 
amounts invoiced to our customers in excess of recognizable revenues are recorded as deferred revenue 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc no 
 stock compensation initial measurement  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based awards made to employees  directors including employee stock options  restricted stock units rsus  performance share awards and employee stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan espp based on estimated fair values 
following the provisions of fasb asc no 
 employee share purchase plans recognition  our espp is considered a compensatory plan  therefore  we are required to recognize compensation cost for grants made under the espp 
we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model and a single option award approach 
the bsm model requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility  expected option life  and risk free interest rate 
management estimates volatility for a given option grant by evaluating the historical volatility of the period immediately preceding the option grant date that is at least equal in length to the option s expected term 
consideration is also given to unusual events either historical or projected or other factors that might suggest that historical volatility will not be a good indicator of future volatility 
the expected life of an award is based on historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards granted to employees  as well as the potential effect from options that had not been exercised at the time 
in accordance with fasb asc no 
 subsequent measurement of stock compensation  we generally recognize stock based compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures  on a ratable basis for all share based payment awards over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period or the remaining service vesting period 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates 
these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our recorded stock based compensation expense could be different 

table of contents financial instruments cash equivalents and marketable securities all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents 
our investments in debt and marketable equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available for sale 
we determine the appropriate classification of such securities at the time of purchase and we reevaluate such classification as of each balance sheet date 
we classify our marketable debt securities as short term investments because of our intention to sell the securities within a relatively short period of time 
unrealized gains and losses on these investments are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the investments are adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity and such amortization is included in interest income 
we periodically assess whether our investments with unrealized loss positions are other than temporarily impaired 
other than temporary impairment charges exists when we have the intent to sell the security and we will more likely than not be required to sell the security before anticipated recovery or we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security 
we determine other than temporary impairments based on the specific identification method and are reported in the consolidated statements of operations 
derivative financial instruments we account for our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and we carry them at fair value 
derivatives that are not defined as hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings 
for derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the derivative gain loss is reported in each reporting period in other income expense on our consolidated statement of operations 
to receive hedge accounting treatment  cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions 
fair value measurements we apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
we define fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities  which are required to be recorded at fair value  we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  such as inherent risk  transfer restrictions and credit risk 
the fair value measurement standard establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value whereby inputs used in valuation techniques are assigned a hierarchical level 
the assignment to a level is based on whether the market participant assumptions used in determining fair value are obtained from independent sources observable inputs or reflect our own assumptions of market participant valuation unobservable inputs 
categorization within the fair value hierarchy is determined by the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
the following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets that are unadjusted and accessible at the measurement date for identical  unrestricted assets or liabilities  level quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are inactive  quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  or significant inputs that are observable  either directly or indirectly  or level prices or valuations that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement 
we consider an active market to be one in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis  and view an inactive market as one in which there are few transactions for the asset or liability  the prices are not current  or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers 
a financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
allowance for doubtful accounts we review collectability of accounts receivable on an on going basis and provide an allowance for amounts we estimate may not be collectible 
during our review  we consider our historical experience  the age of the receivable balance  the credit worthiness of the customer and the reason for the delinquency 
delinquent account balances are written off after we have determined that the likelihood of collection is remote 

table of contents inventories we record inventories at the lower of actual cost  determined on a first in first out fifo basis  or market 
actual cost approximates standard cost  adjusted for variances between standard and actual 
standard costs are determined based on our estimate of material costs  manufacturing yields  costs to assemble  test and package our products and allocable indirect costs 
we record differences between standard costs and actual costs as variances 
these variances are analyzed and are either included on the consolidated balance sheet or the consolidated statement of operations in order to state the inventories at actual costs on a fifo basis 
standard costs are re evaluated quarterly 
provisions are recorded for excess and obsolete inventory and are estimated based on a comparison of the quantity and cost of inventory on hand to our forecast of customer demand 
customer demand is dependent on many factors and requires us to use significant judgment in our forecasting process 
we also make assumptions regarding the rate at which new products will be accepted in the marketplace and at which customers will transition from older products to newer products 
generally  inventories in excess of six months forecasted demand are written down to zero unless specific facts and circumstances warrant no write down or a write down to a different value and the related provision is recorded as a cost of revenue 
once a provision is established  it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or otherwise disposed of  even if in subsequent periods we forecast demand for the product 
long lived assets including goodwill and other acquired intangible assets we review property and equipment  goodwill and other certain identifiable intangibles for impairment 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if property and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value 
we do not amortize goodwill  rather such asset is required to be tested for impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
in  we determined that our goodwill was impaired and recognized a total impairment charge of million in our consolidated statement of operations under operating expenses  impairment of goodwill  which reduced goodwill to zero as of december  also  in  we made an impairment evaluation of our long lived assets and determined that our investment in certain technology of sunplus technology co  ltd 
the sunplus ip was impaired and recognized an impairment charge of million in our consolidated statement of operations under operating expenses  impairment of intangible assets  which reduced the investment in sunplus ip to zero as of december  there were no goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges recorded in fiscal years and we amortize our intangible assets with definite lives over their estimated useful lives and we review these assets for impairment 
all of our acquired intangible assets were fully amortized as of december income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the fasb asc no 
asc  accounting for income taxes 
we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  tax benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in the subsequent period when such a change in estimate occurs 
we use an asset and liability approach for accounting of deferred income taxes  which requires recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements  but have not been reflected in our taxable income 
estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred income tax assets  which arise from temporary differences and carry forwards 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be realized based on the realization criteria set forth in asc no 
to the extent that we believe any amounts are not more likely than not to be realized  we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets 
in the event we determine that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
similarly  if we subsequently realize deferred income tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable  the respective valuation allowance would be reversed  resulting in an adjustment to earnings in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize and measure potential liabilities based upon criteria set forth in asc based upon these criteria  we estimate whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities may result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if our estimate of tax liabilities is less than the amount ultimately assessed  a further charge to expense would result 
significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence  including past operating results  estimates of future taxable income  and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred income tax assets that could be realized  we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding effect to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
significant judgment is also required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions under asc and determining our provision for income taxes 
although we believe our reserves for uncertain tax positions are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded  such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserves for uncertain tax positions and any changes to the reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest and penalties  if applicable 

table of contents restructuring expenses we record provisions for workforce reduction costs and exit costs when they are probable and estimable 
severance paid under ongoing benefit arrangements is recorded in accordance with fasb asc no 
 nonretirement postemployment benefits recognition 
one time termination benefits and contract settlement and lease costs are recorded in accordance with fasb asc no 
 exit or disposal cost obligations recognition 
at each reporting date  we evaluate our accruals related to workforce reduction charges  contract settlement and lease costs to ensure that these accruals are still appropriate 
restructuring expense accruals related to future lease commitments on exited facilities include estimates  primarily related to sublease income over the lease terms and other costs for vacated properties 
increases or decreases to the accruals for changes in estimates are classified as restructuring expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
loss contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset  or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss  in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we record a charge equal to the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 
from time to time  we are involved in disputes  litigation  and other legal actions 
we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters 
however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and these actions or other third party claims against us may cause us to incur costly litigation and or substantial settlement charges 
in addition  the resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may require us to make royalty payments  which could adversely affect gross margins in future periods 
if any of those events were to occur  our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows could be adversely affected 
the actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to adjust our liability and record additional expenses 
guarantees  indemnifications and warranty liabilities certain of our licensing agreements indemnify our customers for expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of patent  trademark or copyright by third parties related to the intellectual property content of our products 
certain of these indemnification provisions are perpetual from execution of the agreement and  in some instances  the maximum amount of potential future indemnification is not limited 
to date  we have not paid any such claims or been required to defend any lawsuits with respect to a claim 
at the time of revenue recognition  we provide an accrual for estimated costs included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets to be incurred pursuant to our warranty obligation 
our estimate is based primarily on historical experience 
commitments  contingencies and concentrations historically  a relatively small number of customers and distributors have generated a significant portion of our revenue 
for instance  our top five customers  including distributors  generated  and of our revenue in  and  respectively 
the percentage of revenue generated through distributors tends to be significant  since many oems rely upon third party manufacturers or distributors to provide purchasing and inventory management functions 
in  of our revenue was generated through distributors  compared to and in and  respectively

a significant portion of our revenue is generated from products sold overseas 
sales including licensing to customers in asia  including distributors  generated  and of our revenue in  and  respectively 
the reason for our geographical concentration in asia is that most of our products are incorporated into flat panel displays  graphic cards and motherboards  the majority of which are manufactured in asia 
the percentage of our revenue derived from any country is dependent upon where our end customers choose to manufacture their products 
accordingly  variability in our geographic revenue is not necessarily indicative of any geographic trends  but rather is the combined effect of new design wins and changes in customer manufacturing locations 
primarily all revenue to date has been denominated in us dollars 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in december  fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 business combinations asc topic 
the amendments in this update specify that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the amendments also improve the usefulness of the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosures by requiring a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments that are directly attributable to the business combination s 
the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
as we did not enter into any business combinations in fiscal year  we believe that the adoption this update will not have any material impact on our financial statement disclosures 
however  if we enter into material business combinations in the future  the adoption of this update may have significant impact on our financial statement disclosures 
in december  fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other asc topic 
under topic on goodwill and other intangible assets  testing for goodwill impairment is a two step test 
when a goodwill impairment test is performed either on an annual or interim basis  an entity must assess whether the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value step 
if it does  an entity must perform an additional test to determine whether goodwill has been impaired and to calculate the amount of that impairment step 
the amendments in this update modify step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
the qualitative factors require that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is not permitted 
as we do not have any significant intangible assets  we believe that the impact of adopting this update will not be material on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
in april  fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition milestone method asc topic 
the amendments in this update provide guidance on the criteria that should be met for determining whether the milestone method of revenue recognition is appropriate 
a vendor can recognize consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a milestone in its entirety as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone meets all criteria to be considered substantive 
determining whether a milestone is substantive requires judgment that should be made at the inception of the arrangement 
to meet the definition of a substantive milestone  the consideration earned by achieving the milestone would have to be commensurate with either the level of effort required to achieve the milestone or the enhancement in the value of the item delivered  would have to relate solely to past performance  and should be reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement 
no bifurcation of an individual milestone is allowed and there can be more than one milestone in an arrangement 
the amendments in this update are effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
we do not believe the impact of the adoption of this guidance will have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
in january  fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures asc topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
the asu requires new disclosures about transfers into and out of levels and and separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements relating to level measurements 
it also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
other than requiring additional disclosures  the adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position

revenue from our ce products and licensing during the year ended december  increased by million or and million or  respectively  compared to the same period in the million or increase in revenue in compared to from our storage product line also contributed positively to the total revenue in the increase in our ce and storage products was primarily due to an increase in unit product shipments 
our unit shipments during the year ended december  for ce and storage increased by and  respectively  compared to the same period in the higher unit shipments in our ce product line were primarily driven by increased demand for our port processors from the dtv market and higher demand for our mobile products due to the new products we introduced in the increase in unit shipments in our storage product was primarily due to higher demand for our sata controllers 
the impact of the increase in unit shipments to our ce revenue was partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price of our ce products 
our licensing activity is complementary to our product sales and helps us to monetize our intellectual property and accelerate market adoption curves associated with our technology 
ip licensing continues to represent an important part of our overall business 
revenue from licensing accounted for and of our total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
licensing revenue during the year ended december  increased by million or when compared to the same period in the significantly higher licensing revenue during the year ended december  compared to the licensing revenue during the same period in was primarily due to the increase in licensing activities in and to the million additional royalties we recorded during fiscal year as a result of the completion of certain licensing audit activities during that year

another factor that caused the unit shipments to decrease from fiscal year to was the integration of the hdmi and sata functionality into pc chip sets 
we also experienced significant declines in our licensing revenues for the year ended december  as compared to the licensing revenues generated in revenue from licensing accounted for and of our total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in licensing revenues in as compared to was due primarily to the overall softening of demand for consumer products as a result of the deterioration of the global economic climate

global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme disruptions since mid  including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  declines in consumer confidence  declines in economic growth  increases in unemployment rates  and uncertainty about economic stability 
there can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions 
these economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways  making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities 
the current tightening of credit in financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending  which may cause our customers to cancel  decrease or delay their existing and future orders with us 
in addition  financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays  increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including government and corporate securities and money market funds 
these securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we also limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and monitoring clear policies and guidelines of our fixed income portfolios 
the guidelines also establish credit quality standards  limits on exposure to any one issuer and limits on exposure to the type of instrument 
due to the limited duration and credit risk criteria established in our guidelines we do not expect the exposure to interest rate risk and credit risk to be material 
if interest rates rise  the market value of our investments may decline  which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
as of december   we had an investment portfolio of securities as reported in short term investments  including those classified as cash equivalents of approximately million 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of december  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus   or basis points over a twelve month time horizon 
the following represents the potential change to the value of our investments given a shift in the yield curve used in our sensitivity analysis 
as of december   we had an investment portfolio of securities as reported in short term investments  including those classified as cash equivalents of approximately million 
these securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
the following represents the potential change to the value of our fixed income securities given a shift in the yield curve used in our sensitivity analysis 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and short term investments and accounts receivable 
a majority of our cash and investments are maintained with a major financial institutions headquartered in the united states 
as part of our cash and investment management processes  we perform periodic evaluations of the credit standing of the financial institutions and we have not sustained any credit losses from investments held at these financial institutions 
the counterparties to the agreements relating to our investment securities consist of various major corporations and financial institutions of high credit standing 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and may require collateral  such as letters of credit  to secure accounts receivable if deemed necessary 
we maintain an allowance for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable based on our assessment of collectability 

table of contents foreign currency exchange risk a majority of our revenue  expense  and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  certain operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies  primarily the euro  the south korean won  taiwan dollar and the chinese yuan 
additionally  many of our foreign distributors price our products in the local currency of the countries in which they sell 
therefore  significant strengthening or weakening of the us dollar relative to those foreign currencies could result in reduced demand or lower us dollar prices or vice versa  for our products  which would negatively affect our operating results 
cash balances held in foreign countries are subject to local banking laws and may bear higher or lower risk than cash deposited in the united states 
the following represents the potential impact of a change in the value of the us dollar compared to the foreign currencies which we use in our operations 
the following represents the potential impact of a change in the value of the us dollar compared to the euro  british pound  japanese yen  chinese yuan  taiwan dollar and korean won for the years ended december  and this sensitivity analysis aggregates our annual activity in these currencies  translated to us dollars  and applies a change in the us dollar value of  and fiscal year million million million fiscal year million million million
