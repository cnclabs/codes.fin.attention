table of contents critical accounting policies overview 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements based on the selection of certain accounting policies  generally accepted accounting principles and customary practices in the banking industry 
these policies  in certain areas  require us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
our accounting policies are described in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included as part of this document 
we consider a policy critical if i the accounting estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the accounting estimate  and ii different estimates that could reasonably have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on our financial statements 
using these criteria  we believe that the accounting policies most critical to us are those associated with our lending practices  including the accounting for the allowance for loan losses  foreclosed assets  investments  intangible assets  income taxes and stock options 
investments 
securities available for sale are reported at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity and other comprehensive income loss  net of taxes 
securities that are held as available for sale are used as a part of our asset liability management strategy 
securities that may be sold in response to interest rate changes  changes in prepayment risk  the need to increase regulatory capital  and other similar factors are classified as available for sale 
loans receivable not covered by loss share and allowance for loan losses 
substantially all of our loans receivable not covered by loss share are reported at their outstanding principal balance adjusted for any charge offs  as it is management s intent to hold them for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff  except for mortgage loans held for sale 
interest income on loans is accrued over the term of the loans based on the principal balance outstanding 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged against income 
the allowance represents an amount that  in management s judgment  will be adequate to absorb probable credit losses on identifiable loans that may become uncollectible and probable credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio 
the amounts of provisions for loan losses are based on management s analysis and evaluation of the loan portfolio for identification of problem credits  internal and external factors that may affect collectability  relevant credit exposure  particular risks inherent in different kinds of lending  current collateral values and other relevant factors 
the allowance consists of allocated and general components 
the allocated component relates to loans that are classified as impaired 
for those loans that are classified as impaired  an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows  or collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan 
the general component covers non classified loans and is based on historical charge off experience and expected loss given default derived from the bank s internal risk rating process 
other adjustments may be made to the allowance for pools of loans after an assessment of internal or external influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss or risking rating data 
loans considered impaired  under fasb asc formerly sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures  are loans for which  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the aggregate amount of impairment of loans is utilized in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and amount of provisions thereto 
losses on impaired loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when in the process of collection it appears likely that such losses will be realized 
the accrual of interest on impaired loans is discontinued when  in management s opinion  the borrower may be unable to meet payments as they become due 
when accrual of interest is discontinued  all unpaid accrued interest is reversed 
groups of loans with similar risk characteristics are collectively evaluated for impairment based on the group s historical loss experience adjusted for changes in trends  conditions and other relevant factors that affect repayment of the loans 

table of contents loans are placed on non accrual status when management believes that the borrower s financial condition  after giving consideration to economic and business conditions and collection efforts  is such that collection of interest is doubtful  or generally when loans are days or more past due 
loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely 
accrued interest related to non accrual loans is generally charged against the allowance for loan losses when accrued in prior years and reversed from interest income if accrued in the current year 
interest income on non accrual loans may be recognized to the extent cash payments are received  although the majority of payments received are usually applied to principal 
non accrual loans are generally returned to accrual status when principal and interest payments are less than days past due  the customer has made required payments for at least nine months  and we reasonably expect to collect all principal and interest 
acquisition accounting  covered loans and related indemnification asset 
beginning in  the company accounts for its acquisitions under asc topic  business combinations  which requires the use of the purchase method of accounting 
all identifiable assets acquired  including loans  are recorded at fair value 
no allowance for loan losses related to the acquired loans is recorded on the acquisition date as the fair value of the loans acquired incorporates assumptions regarding credit risk 
loans acquired are recorded at fair value in accordance with the fair value methodology prescribed in asc topic  exclusive of the shared loss agreements with the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
the fair value estimates associated with the loans include estimates related to expected prepayments and the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal  interest and other cash flows 
over the life of the acquired loans  the company continues to estimate cash flows expected to be collected on pools of loans sharing common risk characteristics  which are treated in the aggregate when applying various valuation techniques 
the company evaluates at each balance sheet date whether the present value of its pools of loans determined using the effective interest rates has decreased and if so  recognizes a provision for loan loss in its consolidated statement of income 
for any increases in cash flows expected to be collected  the company adjusts the amount of accretable yield recognized on a prospective basis over the pool s remaining life 
because the fdic will reimburse the company for certain acquired loans should the company experience a loss  an indemnification asset is recorded at fair value at the acquisition date 
the indemnification asset is recognized at the same time as the indemnified loans  and measured on the same basis  subject to collectability or contractual limitations 
the shared loss agreements on the acquisition date reflect the reimbursements expected to be received from the fdic  using an appropriate discount rate  which reflects counterparty credit risk and other uncertainties 
the shared loss agreements continue to be measured on the same basis as the related indemnified loans 
because the acquired loans are subject to the accounting prescribed by asc topic  subsequent changes to the basis of the shared loss agreements also follow that model 
deterioration in the credit quality of the loans immediately recorded as an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses would immediately increase the basis of the shared loss agreements  with the offset recorded through the consolidated statement of income 
increases in the credit quality or cash flows of loans reflected as an adjustment to yield and accreted into income over the remaining life of the loans decrease the basis of the shared loss agreements  with such decrease being accreted into income over the same period or the life of the shared loss agreements  whichever is shorter 
loss assumptions used in the basis of the indemnified loans are consistent with the loss assumptions used to measure the indemnification asset 
fair value accounting incorporates into the fair value of the indemnification asset an element of the time value of money  which is accreted back into income over the life of the shared loss agreements 
upon the determination of an incurred loss the indemnification asset will be reduced by the amount owed by the fdic 
a corresponding  claim receivable is recorded until cash is received from the fdic 
foreclosed assets held for sale 
assets acquired by foreclosure or in settlement of debt and held for sale are valued at estimated fair value as of the date of foreclosure  and a related valuation allowance is provided for estimated costs to sell the assets 
management evaluates the value of foreclosed assets held for sale periodically and increases the valuation allowance for any subsequent declines in fair value 
changes in the valuation allowance are charged or credited to gain or loss on oreo 

table of contents intangible assets 
intangible assets consist of goodwill and core deposit intangibles 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business acquisitions 
the core deposit intangible represents the excess intangible value of acquired deposit customer relationships as determined by valuation specialists 
the core deposit intangibles are being amortized over to months on a straight line basis 
goodwill is not amortized but rather is evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis 
we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and core deposit intangibles as required by fasb asc  intangibles goodwill and other in the fourth quarter 
income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with income tax accounting guidance asc  income taxes 
the income tax accounting guidance results in two components of income tax expense current and deferred 
current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period by applying the provisions of the enacted tax law to the taxable income or excess of deductions over revenues 
the company determines deferred income taxes using the liability or balance sheet method 
under this method  the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and enacted changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which they occur 
deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods 
deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits  that the tax position will be realized or sustained upon examination 
the term more likely than not means a likelihood of more than percent  the terms examined and upon examination also include resolution of the related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the determination of whether or not a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold considers the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date and is subject to the management s judgment 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of evidence available  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company and its subsidiaries file consolidated tax returns 
its subsidiaries provide for income taxes on a separate return basis  and remits to the company amounts determined to be currently payable 
stock options 
in accordance with fasb asc  compensation stock compensation and fasb asc  equity based payments to non employees  the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant 
the company recognizes compensation expense for the grant date fair value of the option award over the vesting period of the award

fdic assisted acquisitions the acquisitions of old southern bank  key west bank  coastal community bank  bayside savings bank  wakulla bank and gulf state community bank are seen as attractive by home bancshares 
the transactions provide the ability to expand into opportunistic markets and increase market share in florida 
the transactions are anticipated to be profitable due to the pricing associated with the acquired loan portfolio and the establishment of the indemnification asset 
the ability to add immediate deposit growth helps to supplement organic deposit growth 
also  reduction in the duplication of efforts and centralization of functions within the organizations is expected to lead to increased efficiencies and increased profitability 
should the acquired markets not perform as expected  the losses associated with the covered assets significantly exceed expectations  the operational efforts required to integrate the acquisitions and manage the loss share require significantly more resources than anticipated or the overall financial performance of the acquired institutions may not reach expectations and may adversely affect the overall financial performance of our company 
fdic assisted acquisitions true up our purchase and assumption agreements in connection with our fdic assisted acquisitions allow the fdic to recover a portion of the loss share funds previously paid out under the indemnification agreements in the event losses fail to reach the expected loss under a claw back provision 
should the markets associated with any of the banks we acquired through fdic assisted transactions perform better than initially projected  the bank is required to pay this clawback or true up payment to the fdic on a specified date following the tenth anniversary of such acquisition the true up measurement date 

table of contents specifically  in connection with the old southern and key west acquisitions  such true up payments would be equal to of the excess  if any  of i of a stated threshold of million in the case of old southern and million in the case of key west  less ii the sum of a of the asset premium discount plus b of the cumulative shared loss payments defined as the aggregate of all of the payments made or payable to centennial bank minus the aggregate of all of the payments made or payable to the fdic plus c the period servicing amounts for any twelve month period prior to and ending on the true up measurement date defined as the product of the simple average of the principal amount of shared loss loans and shared loss assets other than shared loss securities at the beginning and end of such period times 
in connection with the coastal bayside  wakulla and gulf state acquisitions  the true up payments would be equal to of the excess  if any  of i of an intrinsic loss estimate of million in the case of coastal  million in the case of bayside  million in the case of wakulla and million in the case of gulf state  less ii the sum of a of the net loss amount the sum of all losses less the sum of all recoveries on covered assets plus b of the asset premium discount plus c of the total loans subject to loss sharing under the loss sharing agreements as specified in the schedules to the agreements 
future acquisitions in our continuing evaluation of our growth plans for the company  we believe properly priced bank acquisitions can complement our organic growth and de novo branching growth strategies 
in the near term  our principal acquisition focus will be to expand our presence in florida  arkansas and other nearby markets through pursuing additional fdic assisted acquisition opportunities 
while we seek to be a successful bidder to the fdic on one or more additional failed depository institutions within our targeted markets  there is no assurance that we will be the winning bidder on other fdic assisted transactions 
we will continue evaluating all types of potential bank acquisitions to determine what is in the best interest of our company 
our goal in making these decisions is to maximize the return to our investors 
branches we intend to continue opening new commonly referred to de novo branches in our current markets and in other attractive market areas if opportunities arise 
during no de novo branches were opened 
during  we opened a branch location in the arkansas community of heber springs 
during  we opened two de novo branch locations 
these branch locations are located in the arkansas communities of morrilton and cabot 
presently  we are evaluating additional opportunities but have no firm commitments for any additional de novo branch locations 
as a result of the evaluation process for cost saving opportunities as part of our aspirations to improve efficiencies  three existing arkansas branches were closed during the second quarter of and one existing florida branch was closed during the fourth quarter of the arkansas locations closed were located in new edinburg  kingsland and one of our two heights neighborhood locations in little rock 
the florida branch closed was located in duck key 
during  centennial bank entered into six loss sharing agreements with the fdic 
through these six transactions  the company has added a total of thirty six branch locations in florida 
these branch locations include one in the florida keys  six in the greater orlando msa  and twenty nine in the florida panhandle  which contains seven locations in the panama city msa and ten locations in the tallahassee msa 
the company is currently evaluating the branch locations acquired from the fdic 
although the company plans to keep most of the acquired branches  final determinations are still in progress 
the company  however  does expect eight strategic branch closures to occur during the first part of these include one branch in port st 
joe and one grocery store branch in each of the crawfordville and blountstown locations 
the remaining five strategic branch closures during the first part of are the branches associated with the gulf state acquisition

net interest income net interest income  our principal source of earnings  is the difference between the interest income generated by earning assets and the total interest cost of the deposits and borrowings obtained to fund those assets 
factors affecting the level of net interest income include the volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  yields earned on loans and investments and rates paid on deposits and other borrowings  the level of non performing loans and the amount of non interest bearing liabilities supporting earning assets 
net interest income is analyzed in the discussion and tables below on a fully taxable equivalent basis 
the adjustment to convert certain income to a fully taxable equivalent basis consists of dividing tax exempt income by one minus the combined federal and state income tax rate

 accounting for contingencies and no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
specific allocations are determined for loans considered to be impaired and loss factors are assigned to the remainder of the loan portfolio to determine an appropriate level in the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance is increased  as necessary  by making a provision for loan losses 
the specific allocations for impaired loans are assigned based on an estimated net realizable value after a thorough review of the credit relationship 
the potential loss factors associated with the remainder of the loan portfolio are based on an internal net loss experience  as well as management s review of trends within the portfolio and related industries 
during these tough economic times  the company continues to follow our historical conservative procedures for lending and evaluating the provision and allowance for loan losses 
we have not and do not participate in higher risk lending such as subprime 
our practice continues to be primarily traditional real estate lending with strong loan to value ratios 
while there have been declines in our collateral value  particularly florida  these declines have been addressed in our assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 

table of contents generally  commercial  commercial real estate  and residential real estate loans are assigned a level of risk at origination 
thereafter  these loans are reviewed on a regular basis 
the periodic reviews generally include loan payment and collateral status  the borrowers financial data  and key ratios such as cash flows  operating income  liquidity  and leverage 
a material change in the borrower s credit analysis can result in an increase or decrease in the loan s assigned risk grade 
aggregate dollar volume by risk grade is monitored on an on going basis 
our management reviews certain key loan quality indicators on a monthly basis  including current economic conditions  delinquency trends and ratios  portfolio mix changes  and other information management deems necessary 
this review process provides a degree of objective measurement that is used in conjunction with periodic internal evaluations 
to the extent that this review process yields differences between estimated and actual observed losses  adjustments are made to the loss factors used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses 
our company is primarily a real estate lender in arkansas and florida 
as such we are subject to declines in asset quality when real estate prices fall during a recession 
the current recession has harshly impacted the real estate market in florida 
during  many real estate values declined in the plus percent range in florida 
the florida real estate prices continue to decline but the rate of decline has slowed down in and compared to the arkansas economy in our markets has been stable over the past several years with no boom or bust 
as a result  the arkansas economy has fared much better with only low single digit declines in real estate values annually since during the first quarter of  we began to experience a decline in our asset quality  particularly in the florida market 
in  non performing non covered loans started the year at million but ended the year at million 
as of december  and  non performing non covered loans were million and million  respectively 
the provision for loan losses represents management s determination of the amount necessary to be charged against the current period s earnings  to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that is considered adequate in relation to the estimated risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
the provision was million for the year ended december   million for december   and million for our provision for loan losses increased million  or to million for the year ended december   from million for the net loans charged off for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the same period in the provision for loan losses in our florida market was approximately million for the increase in the provision for loan losses is primarily associated with the million in net charges for impairment during to certain loans or a million increase from of the million net charged off for the impaired loans  approximately million is from our florida market

the  aggregate decrease in mortgage servicing income was related to the sale of the mortgage servicing portfolio during the year

the  aggregate decrease in dividends from fhlb  frb bankers bank is primarily the result of lower yields in the current economic recession 
the equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate was related to the interest in white river bancshares that we purchased during because the investment in white river bancshares is accounted for on the equity method  we recorded our share of white river bancshares operating earnings 
white river bancshares repurchased our interest in their company on march  this resulted in a one time gain on the sale of the equity investment of million 
the million loss on oreo in is primarily the result of a million write down on oreo related to a foreclosure on an owner occupied commercial rental center in the florida market

table of contents because the fdic will reimburse us for certain acquired loans should we experience a loss  an indemnification asset was recorded at fair value at the acquisition date 
the difference between the fair value recorded at the acquisition date and the gross reimbursements expected to be received from the fdic are accreted into income over the life of the indemnification asset using an appropriate discount rate  which reflects counterparty credit risk and other uncertainties 
during the second quarter of  we sold our mortgage servicing portfolio to a third party 
this transaction resulted in a gain of approximately  and was recorded as other income 
the servicing portfolio historically did not provide a material amount of profit or loss nor was it expected to in the future 
the sale will allow management to focus more of its time to community banking 
plus  it will reduce our balance sheet risk from exposure to an impairment of the mortgage servicing rights

when management determines that a loan is no longer performing  and that collection of interest appears doubtful  the loan is placed on non accrual status 
loans that are days past due are placed on non accrual status unless they are adequately secured and there is reasonable assurance of full collection of both principal and interest

our bank subsidiary recognizes income principally on the accrual basis of accounting 
when loans are classified as non accrual  the accrued interest is charged off and no further interest is accrued  unless the credit characteristics of the loan improve 
if a loan is determined by management to be uncollectible  the portion of the loan determined to be uncollectible is then charged to the allowance for loan losses 
the florida franchise contains approximately and of our non performing non covered loans as of december  and  respectively 
since december   the weakened real estate market  particularly in florida  has and may continue to increase our level of non performing non covered loans 
while we believe our allowance for loan losses is adequate at december   as additional facts become known about relevant internal and external factors that affect loan collectability and our assumptions  it may result in us making additions to the provision for loan losses during troubled debt restructurings tdr generally occur when a borrower is experiencing  or is expected to experience  financial difficulties in the near term 
as a result  the bank will work with the borrower to prevent further difficulties  and ultimately to improve the likelihood of recovery on the loan 
in this current real estate crisis  for the nation in general and florida in particular  it has become more common to restructure or modify the terms of certain loans under certain conditions 
in those circumstances it may be beneficial to restructure the terms of a loan and work with the borrower for the benefit of both parties  versus forcing the property into foreclosure and having to dispose of it in an unfavorable and depressed real estate market 
when we have modified the terms of a loan  we usually either reduce the monthly payment and or interest rate for generally about three to twelve months 
we have not forgiven any material principal amounts on any loan modifications to date 
only non performing restructured loans are included in our non performing non covered loans 
as of december   we had million of non covered restructured loans that are in compliance with the modified terms and are not reported as past due or non accrual in table of the million in non covered restructured loans  million are also reported as non covered impaired loans 
our florida market contains million of these non covered restructured loans 

table of contents to facilitate this process  a loan modification that might not otherwise be considered may be granted resulting in classification as a troubled debt restructuring 
these loans can involve loans remaining on non accrual  moving to non accrual  or continuing on an accrual status  depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower 
generally  a non accrual loan that is restructured remains on non accrual for a period of six months to demonstrate that the borrower can meet the restructured terms 
however  performance prior to the restructuring  or significant events that coincide with the restructuring  are considered in assessing whether the borrower can pay the new terms and may result in the loan being returned to an accrual status after a shorter performance period 
if the borrower s ability to meet the revised payment schedule is not reasonably assured  the loan will remain in a nonaccrual status 
the majority of the bank s loan modifications relate to commercial lending and involve reducing the interest rate  changing from a principal and interest payment to interest only  a lengthening of the amortization period  or a combination of some or all of the three 
in addition  it is common for the bank to seek additional collateral or guarantor support when modifying a loan 
the amount of troubled debt restructurings increased during and  as the bank continued to work with borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties 
and of all restructured loans were performing to the terms of the restructure as of december  and  respectively

table of contents total non performing non covered loans were million as of december   compared to million as of december  for an increase of million 
the increase in non performing loans is primarily from our arkansas market 
non performing loans at december  are million and million in the arkansas and florida markets  respectively 
if the non accrual non covered loans had been accruing interest in accordance with the original terms of their respective agreements  interest income of approximately million for the year ended december   million in  and million in would have been recorded 
interest income recognized on the non accrual non covered loans for the years ended december   and was considered immaterial 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that we will not receive all amounts due according to the contracted terms of the loans 
impaired loans may include non performing loans loans past due days or more and non accrual loans and certain other loans identified by management that are still performing 
as of december   average non covered impaired loans were million compared to million as of december  as of december   non covered impaired loans were million compared to million as of december  for an increase of million 
this increase is the result of the underlying value of collateral on non covered loans continuing to deteriorate in the current unfavorable economic conditions 
as of december   our florida market accounted for million of the non covered impaired loans 
we evaluated loans purchased in conjunction with the acquisitions of old southern  key west  coastal bayside  wakulla and gulf state for impairment in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc topic  loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality 
purchased covered loans are considered impaired if there is evidence of credit deterioration since origination and if it is probable that not all contractually required payments will be collected 
all covered loans acquired in these transactions were deemed to be covered impaired loans 
these loans were not classified as nonperforming assets at december   as the loans are accounted for on a pooled basis and the pools are considered to be performing 
therefore  interest income  through accretion of the difference between the carrying amount of the loans and the expected cash flows  is being recognized on all purchased impaired loans 
non performing loans and impaired loans are defined differently 
some loans may be included in both categories

the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which our management believes is adequate to absorb all probable losses on loans in the loan portfolio 
the amount of the allowance is affected by i loan charge offs  which decrease the allowance  ii recoveries on loans previously charged off  which increase the allowance  and iii the provision of possible loan losses charged to income  which increases the allowance 
in determining the provision for possible loan losses  it is necessary for our management to monitor fluctuations in the allowance resulting from actual charge offs and recoveries and to periodically review the size and composition of the loan portfolio in light of current and anticipated economic conditions 
if actual losses exceed the amount of allowance for loan losses  our earnings could be adversely affected 

table of contents as we evaluate the allowance for loan losses  we categorize it as follows i specific allocations  ii allocations for criticized and classified assets with no specific allocation  iii general allocations for each major loan category  and iv miscellaneous allocations 
specific allocations 
as a general rule  if a specific allocation is warranted  it is the result of an analysis of a previously classified credit or relationship 
typically  when it becomes evident through the payment history or a financial statement review that a loan or relationship is no longer supported by the cash flows of the asset and or borrower and has become collateral dependent  we will use appraisals or other collateral analysis to determine if collateral impairment has occurred 
the amount or likelihood of loss on this credit may not yet be evident  so a charge off would not be prudent 
however  if the analysis indicates that an impairment has occurred  then a specific allocation will be determined for this loan 
if our existing appraisal is outdated or the collateral has been subject to significant market changes  we will obtain a new appraisal for this impairment analysis 
all but one of the company s impaired loans are collateral dependent at the present time  so third party appraisals were used to determine the necessary impairment for these loans 
cash flow available to service debt was used for the other impaired loan 
this analysis will be performed each quarter in connection with the preparation of the analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  and if necessary  adjustments will be made to the specific allocation provided for a particular loan 
as a general rule  when it becomes evident that the full principal and accrued interest of a loan may not be collected  or by law at days past due  we will reflect that loan as nonperforming 
it will remain nonperforming until it performs in a manner that it is reasonable to expect that we will collect the full principal and accrued interest 
when the amount or likelihood of a loss on a loan has been determined  a charge off should be taken in the period it is determined 
if a partial charge off occurs  the quarterly impairment analysis will determine if the loan is still impaired  and thus continues to require a specific allocation 
allocations for criticized and classified assets with no specific allocation 
we establish allocations for loans rated special mention through loss in accordance with the guidelines established by the regulatory agencies 
a percentage rate is applied to each loan category to determine the level of dollar allocation 
general allocations 
we establish general allocations for each major loan category 
this section also includes allocations to loans  which are collectively evaluated for loss such as residential real estate  commercial real estate  consumer loans and commercial and industrial loans 
the allocations in this section are based on a historical review of loan loss experience and past due accounts 
we give consideration to trends  changes in loan mix  delinquencies  prior losses  and other related information

charge offs and recoveries 
total charge offs increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in total recoveries increased slightly to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in net charge offs increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in of the million net charged off for the impaired loans  approximately million is related to arkansas borrowers and million is related to florida borrowers 
specifically  the significant arkansas charge offs consisted of the following a relationship that included several real estate loans and commercial and industrial c i loans 
at the time the loans were made  the real estate loans were supported by independent real estate appraisals indicating the value was within regulatory guidelines 
the most significant c i loans were secured by accounts receivable of a substantial nature and were made within existing policy guidelines 
during december  management was advised by counsel of a substantial change in circumstances regarding the collectability of pledged receivables 
as a result  the board of directors met and determined that charge offs were necessary because the terms and conditions of the loans were unlikely to be met 
in addition  it became apparent that litigation regarding a portion of the receivables would not be resolved in a reasonable period of time 
after reassessment of the collectability of the c i debt and reappraisals of the real estate loans  the charge off on this relationship during the fourth quarter of was million 
after the charge off  this borrower and his related entities have remaining loan balances of million 
of the remaining loan balances  million are collateral dependent and supported by current independent appraisals and million are serviced by other creditworthy borrowers 
a relationship that included several loans secured by both real estate and by rural improvement district bonds 
in the fourth quarter of  it was determined that many of these rural improvement bonds were fraudulent  and after a detailed review of the circumstances surrounding each loan  the fourth quarter charge off on this relationship was million 
the remaining loan balances of million are collateral dependent  and the real estate loans are supported by current independent appraisals 
a relationship that included several loans for real estate development projects that failed in the total charge off for this relationship was million  of which  occurred in the second quarter when the borrower could no longer service the debt related to the projects 
new appraisals were ordered to determine the current value of the collateral dependent loans  and based on these new appraisals  the specific reserve for these credits was placed at  during the fourth quarter of  we took legal action to obtain the related collateral and then charged off the remaining million as expected loss 
this higher than expected charge off was due to unanticipated deterioration in the overall real estate development in which these loans reside that came to light in the fourth quarter 
the remaining balance of million is collateral dependent  in the process of foreclosure  and supported by current independent appraisals 
a relationship that included one c i loan of million 
we charged this loan off in full in the first quarter of after we determined that the collateral securing the loan was worthless 
the loan had a specific reserve of the full amount of million in the quarter prior to the charge off 
a relationship that included one loan of million secured by mixed collateral 
we charged off the loan in full in the third quarter after the borrower could no longer service the debt 
the remaining million in arkansas charge offs consisted of many relationships with no individual relationship consisting of charge offs greater than million 

table of contents specifically  the significant florida charge offs consisted of the following a relationship that included several real estate development loans totaling million 
at the time of the loans  they were supported by independent real estate appraisals indicating the values were within regulatory guidelines  and the projects were supported by development plans that appeared appropriate at the time 
none of the projects were income producing  and all of the developments stalled in in the fourth quarter  we determined that the outside income originally anticipated providing debt service capability was not going to materialize in a reasonable period of time 
therefore  we moved the loans to non accrual status  and new appraisals were ordered to determine the level of impairment 
the new appraisals obtained in november led to a fourth quarter charge off of million 
the remaining collateral dependent loan balance of million is supported by the appraisals obtained in november a relationship consisting of real estate development loans totaling million 
at the time of each loan  the advances were supported by independent real estate appraisals indicating the values were within regulatory guidelines  and the projects were supported by development plans that appeared appropriate at the time 
the largest of the developments reached a point in mid where it could no longer support the million debt associated with the project 
through discussions with the borrower and analysis of the project  we determined that the current income of the project could only support million in debt 
we charged down the loan during the fourth quarter of by million 
the remaining balance of million is supported by the current cash flow of the project and is not considered to be collateral dependent 
in addition  a loan totaling million could no longer be serviced by the borrower  and due to the uncertainty of collectability through liquidation due to an intervening lien  the full balance of million was charged off in the fourth quarter of a relationship of two loans totaling million made for the construction of a single family home for resale 
the initial construction loan of million was made in the loan was supported by an independent real estate appraisal indicating the value was within regulatory guidelines  and the construction was supported by a development plan that appeared appropriate at the time 
construction was not completed with this amount  and an additional loan of  was made to complete the structure in the general decline in the florida market has affected this value  and we began foreclosure proceedings in the fourth quarter of the specific reserve for this credit ranged from million to million in the three quarters prior to the fourth quarter charge off of million 
the remaining balance of  is collateral dependent  in the process of foreclosure  and supported by a current independent appraisal 
a borrower with one commercial real estate loan totaling million 
at the time the loan was made  it was supported by an independent real estate appraisal indicating the value was within regulatory guidelines and a cash flow analysis indicating the ability to service the debt 
the general decline in the florida tourist market affected the cash flow of the project  and the borrower became unable to service the debt in the loan was placed on non accrual status in the second quarter of and we continued to attempt to restructure the debt 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that the current cash flow of the project would only support  a total of million was charged off in the fourth quarter on this credit  and the remaining  has been restructured and is supported by a current independent appraisal and the cash flow of the project 
an individual with one c i loan totaling million 
the loan was secured by the stock in a bank that failed in the fourth quarter of  and a specific reserve for the full balance was maintained at that time 
the individual subsequently died  and the estate had no assets available for our claim  so the loan was charged off in full in the second quarter of the remaining million in florida charge offs consisted of many relationships with no individual relationship consisting of charge offs greater than million

table of contents allocated allowance for loan losses 
we use a risk rating and specific reserve methodology in the calculation and allocation of our allowance for loan losses 
while the allowance is allocated to various loan categories in assessing and evaluating the level of the allowance  the allowance is available to cover charge offs incurred in all loan categories 
because a portion of our portfolio has not matured to the degree necessary to obtain reliable loss data from which to calculate estimated future losses  the unallocated portion of the allowance is an integral component of the total allowance 
although unassigned to a particular credit relationship or product segment  this portion of the allowance is vital to safeguard against the imprecision inherent in estimating credit losses 
the changes for the period ended december  in the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for the individual types of loans are primarily associated with changes in the asc calculations  both individual and aggregate  and changes in the asc calculations 
these calculations are affected by changes in individual loan impairments  changes in asset quality  net charge offs during the period and normal changes in the outstanding loan portfolio  as well any changes to the general allocation factors due to changes within the actual characteristics of the loan portfolio

table of contents investment securities our securities portfolio is the second largest component of earning assets and provides a significant source of revenue 
securities within the portfolio are classified as held to maturity  available for sale  or trading based on the intent and objective of the investment and the ability to hold to maturity 
fair values of securities are based on quoted market prices where available 
if quoted market prices are not available  estimated fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable securities 
as of december  and  we had no held to maturity or trading securities 
securities available for sale are reported at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity as other comprehensive income 
securities that are held as available for sale are used as a part of our asset liability management strategy 
securities may be sold in response to interest rate changes  changes in prepayment risk  the need to increase regulatory capital  and other similar factors are classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities were million as of december   compared to million as of december  the estimated effective duration of our securities portfolio was years as of december  as of december   million  or  of the available for sale securities were invested in mortgage backed securities  compared to million  or  of the available for sale securities in the prior year 
to reduce our income tax burden  million  or  of the available for sale securities portfolio as of december   was primarily invested in tax exempt obligations of state and political subdivisions  compared to million  or  of the available for sale securities as of december  also  we had approximately million  or  in obligations of us government sponsored enterprises in the available for sale securities portfolio as of december   compared to million  or  of the available for sale securities in the prior year 
certain investment securities are valued at less than their historical cost 
these declines are primarily the result of the rate for these investments yielding less than current market rates 
based on evaluation of available evidence  we believe the declines in fair value for these securities are temporary 
it is our intent to hold these securities to recovery 
should the impairment of any of these securities become other than temporary  the cost basis of the investment will be reduced and the resulting loss recognized in net income in the period the other than temporary impairment is identified 
during  we became aware fraudulent rural improvement district bonds had been sold to various financial institutions in arkansas 
as a result of the apparent fraud the board of directors authorized a million other than temporary charge to our investment securities

risk based capital 
we as well as our bank subsidiary are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and other discretionary actions by regulators that  if enforced  could have a direct material effect on our financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
our capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators as to components  risk weightings and other factors 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require us to maintain minimum amounts and ratios set forth in the table below of total and tier capital to risk weighted assets  and of tier capital to average assets

table of contents quarterly results during the fourth quarter of  our company reported a net loss of million  or diluted loss per share 
we experienced several large financial items during the quarter 
these items include million in pre tax bargain purchase gains from two fdic assisted acquisitions  a million charge for impairment to certain loans which resulted in us recording a fourth quarter of provision for loan losses of million  a million charge to investment securities as a result of an apparent fraud on bonds sold in arkansas and million of merger expenses from our two fourth quarter fdic assisted acquisitions 
the increased fourth quarter provision for loan loss was primarily attributable to a million charge for impairment to certain loans 
of the amount charged off for the impaired loans  approximately half is related to extensions of credit to several borrowers whose financial condition has deteriorated in our florida market 
the remaining portion relates to loans in our arkansas market  primarily involving two borrowing relationships 
after a review of the loans to one large arkansas borrower  the company determined the terms and conditions of the loan documents are unlikely to be met due to a recent change in circumstances regarding the collectability of pledged collateral 
in addition  fraudulent arkansas loans made to a separate arkansas borrower were associated with the issuance of fraudulent rural improvement district bonds were also included in the loan charge offs for this conclusion with respect to the remainder of the loans was based on the lack of significant economic recovery in certain areas of our florida market combined with our unsuccessful efforts thus far to collect on the loans

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk liquidity and market risk management liquidity management 
liquidity refers to the ability or the financial flexibility to manage future cash flows to meet the needs of depositors and borrowers and fund operations 
maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity allows us to have sufficient funds available for reserve requirements  customer demand for loans  withdrawal of deposit balances and maturities of deposits and other liabilities 
our primary source of liquidity at our holding company is dividends paid by our bank subsidiary 
applicable statutes and regulations impose restrictions on the amount of dividends that may be declared by our bank subsidiary 
further  any dividend payments are subject to the continuing ability of the bank subsidiary to maintain compliance with minimum federal regulatory capital requirements and to retain its characterization under federal regulations as a well capitalized institution 
our bank subsidiary has potential obligations resulting from the issuance of standby letters of credit and commitments to fund future borrowings to our loan customers 
many of these obligations and commitments to fund future borrowings to our loans customers are expected to expire without being drawn upon  therefore the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements affecting our liquidity position 
liquidity needs can be met from either assets or liabilities 
on the asset side  our primary sources of liquidity include cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  available for sale investment securities and scheduled repayments and maturities of loans 
we maintain adequate levels of cash and cash equivalents to meet our day to day needs 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents were million  or of total assets  compared to million  or of total assets  as of december  our investment securities and federal funds sold were million as of december  and million as of december  
table of contents as of december   million  or  of our securities portfolio  excluding mortgage backed securities  matured within one year  and million  or  excluding mortgage backed securities  matured after one year but within five years 
as of december   million  or  of our securities portfolio  excluding mortgage backed securities  matured within one year  and million  or  excluding mortgage backed securities  matured after one year but within five years 
as of december  and  million and million  respectively  of securities were pledged as collateral for various public fund deposits and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
our commercial and real estate lending activities are concentrated in loans with maturities of less than five years 
as of december  and  approximately billion  or  and billion  or  respectively  of our total loans matured within one year and or had adjustable interest rates 
a loan is considered fixed rate if the loan is currently at its adjustable floor or ceiling 
as a result of the low interest rate environment  the company has approximately million of loans that cannot be additionally priced down but could price up if rates were to return to higher levels 
additionally  we maintain loan participation agreements with other financial institutions in which we could participate out loans for additional liquidity should the need arise 
on the liability side  our principal sources of liquidity are deposits  borrowed funds  and access to capital markets 
customer deposits are our largest sources of funds 
as of december   our total deposits were billion  or of total assets  compared to billion  or of total assets  as of december  we attract our deposits primarily from individuals  business  and municipalities located in our market areas 
we may occasionally use our fed funds lines of credit in order to temporarily satisfy short term liquidity needs 
we have fed funds lines with three other financial institutions pursuant to which we could have borrowed up to million and million on an unsecured basis as of december  and december   respectively 
these lines may be terminated by the respective lending institutions at any time 
we also maintain lines of credit with the federal home loan bank 
our fhlb borrowed funds were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
all of the outstanding balance was issued as long term advances 
our fhlb borrowing capacity was million and million as of december  and december  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our current operations 
market risk management 
our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of our assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  other than those which possess a short term to maturity 
we do not hold market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
asset liability management 
our management actively measures and manages interest rate risk 
the asset liability committees of the boards of directors of our holding company and bank subsidiary are also responsible for approving our asset liability management policies  overseeing the formulation and implementation of strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and earnings  and reviewing our interest rate sensitivity position 
one of the tools that our management uses to measure short term interest rate risk is a net interest income simulation model 
this analysis calculates the difference between net interest income forecasted using base market rates and using a rising and a falling interest rate scenario 
the income simulation model includes various assumptions regarding the re pricing relationships for each of our products 
many of our assets are floating rate loans  which are assumed to re price immediately  and proportional to the change in market rates  depending on their contracted index 
some loans and investments include the opportunity of prepayment embedded options  and accordingly the simulation model uses indexes to estimate these prepayments and reinvest their proceeds at current yields 
our non term deposit products re price more slowly  usually changing less than the change in market rates and at our discretion 

table of contents this analysis indicates the impact of changes in net interest income for the given set of rate changes and assumptions 
it assumes the balance sheet remains static and that its structure does not change over the course of the year 
it does not account for all factors that impact this analysis  including changes by management to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes or secondary impacts such as changes to our credit risk profile as interest rates change 
furthermore  loan prepayment rate estimates and spread relationships change regularly 
interest rate changes create changes in actual loan prepayment rates that will differ from the market estimates incorporated in this analysis 
changes that vary significantly from the assumptions may have significant effects on our net interest income 
for the rising and falling interest rate scenarios  the base market interest rate forecast was increased and decreased over twelve months by and basis points  respectively 
at december   our net interest margin exposure related to these hypothetical changes in market interest rates was within the current guidelines established by us

our primary business is banking and the resulting earnings  primarily net interest income  are susceptible to changes in market interest rates 
it is management s goal to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risks 
a key element in the financial performance of financial institutions is the level and type of interest rate risk assumed 
the single most significant measure of interest rate risk is the relationship of the repricing periods of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the more closely the repricing periods are correlated  the less interest rate risk we assume 
we use repricing gap and simulation modeling as the primary methods in analyzing and managing interest rate risk 
gap analysis attempts to capture the amounts and timing of balances exposed to changes in interest rates at a given point in time 
our gap position as of december  was asset sensitive with a one year cumulative repricing gap of 
during these periods  the amount of change our asset base realizes in relation to the total change in market interest rate exceeds that of the liability base 
we have a portion of our securities portfolio invested in mortgage backed securities 
mortgage backed securities are included based on their final maturity date 
expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties
