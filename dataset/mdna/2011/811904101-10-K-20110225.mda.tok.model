item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview seacor and its subsidiaries are in the business of owning  operating  investing in and marketing equipment  primarily in the offshore oil and gas  industrial aviation and marine transportation industries 
the company conducts its activities in six primary business segments offshore marine services operates a diversified fleet of offshore support vessels primarily servicing offshore oil and gas exploration  development and production facilities worldwide 
aviation services operates and leases helicopters that provide transportation services supporting offshore oil and gas activities primarily in the united states  air medical services to hospitals in the united states  and international leasing activities 
inland river services is primarily engaged in dry and liquid cargo transportation on the us inland river waterways and the gulf intracoastal waterways for a range of agricultural and industrial products 
marine transportation services operates a fleet of us flag product tankers carrying petroleum  crude oil and chemical products in the us coastwise trade 
environmental services is primarily engaged in the provision of emergency preparedness and response services to oil  chemical  industrial and marine transportation clients in the united states and abroad 
commodity trading and logistics is an integrated business involved in the purchase  storage  transportation and sale of agricultural and energy commodities 
other primarily includes harbor and offshore towing services  various other investments in joint ventures  primarily providing industrial air services  and lending and leasing activities 
the company s business segments  with the exception of environmental services and commodity trading and logistics  are asset related and highly capital intensive 
demand for the company s assets is cyclical in varying degrees due to fluctuations in the activity levels in the industries serviced by those assets  as well as availability of supply 
to manage capital successfully over time  the company continually assesses its asset portfolio and pursues opportunities to realize value from its assets by shifting their operation to other markets or trading them when circumstances warrant 
the company actively leases out and leases in  and buys and sells equipment in the ordinary course of its business 
it also designs  orders  builds  upgrades  operates or re sells newly constructed equipment 
the company typically pursues a strategy of shedding older assets while adjusting its asset mix 
the company also leases assets to other operators and sells assets to financial lessors and leases them back for varying periods of time 
the company believes that maintaining significant liquidity is an important factor that will enable it to take advantage of opportunities as they arise 
in recent years  the company has sought to create balance in its businesses and broaden its asset base by investing outside the oil and gas industry in barges  ships and tugs  and by looking for opportunities to engage in logistics support for movement of agricultural and energy commodities 
the company is exploring opportunities to extend its industrial aviation activities through investments in sales  marketing and distribution of aircraft and specialized parts and services  maintenance and repair facilities and fixed base operations 
in addition  the company continues to look to expand in the chinese and indian markets 

table of contents the company believes that demand for its barges  tankers and tugs is  in part  linked to different factors than those that drive demand for offshore oil and gas exploration and development 
in addition  for barges and tankers  contracts can sometimes be secured with longer terms than those typically available for offshore marine and helicopter services 
the expectation is that over time this strategy of diversification will provide better returns on capital than could be achieved by restricting investment to one specific  highly cyclical  asset class such as vessels supporting offshore oil and gas activity 
the company believes this strategy will afford more opportunities to use capital efficiently  create greater stability of earnings and allow improved margins due to operational synergies that in turn  should yield a lower cost of capital  more sustainable cash flows and increased profitability 
deepwater horizon oil spill response the company s operating results for the year ended december  were significantly impacted by oil spill response activities relating to the bp macondo well incident in the us gulf of mexico following the sinking of the semi submersible drilling rig deepwater horizon in april the oil spill response 
at the height of the oil spill response  four of the company s business segments were actively providing support 
environmental services provided i equipment and people to support clean up activities on shore  ii professional assistance  consulting services and software systems in support of incident management activities at various strategic locations  and iii assistance in the provision of manpower for clean up operations throughout the region 
offshore marine services provided i vessels for a variety of functions including vessel decontamination  skimming  lightering  offshore traffic control and accommodation  and ii technical and video equipment on vessels engaged in the response to allow for instant tracking of assets and surveillance of operations 
aviation services provided i helicopters for air support to us coast guard observers undertaking oil spotting and assessment missions  ii transportation for various other officials requiring overflights to assess the response and recovery efforts  and iii a flight tracking system to monitor the movement of all marine and aviation assets involved in the response 
harbor and offshore towing services provided tugs engaged in the decontamination of vessels transiting the region 
oil spill response activity has significantly diminished since december  the company s remaining involvement consists of limited professional services provided by environmental services 
as an active party to the oil spill response  the company has been named in individual and class action litigations involving environmental damage  business and personal injury claims that may result in financial exposure 
in reaction to the deepwater horizon bp macondo well incident  the us department of the interior issued an order on may  imposing a six month moratorium on all offshore deepwater drilling projects 
a preliminary injunction was issued on june  blocking enforcement of the moratorium  however  the us department of interior issued a new moratorium on july  which was lifted on october  the us department of interior has also implemented additional safety and certification requirements for drilling activities  imposed additional requirements for the approval of development and production activities  and delayed the approval of applications to drill in both deepwater and shallow water areas 
the company s results  in particular those of its offshore marine services and aviation services segments  could be adversely impacted as a consequence of reduced drilling activities in the us gulf of mexico

offshore marine services the market for offshore oil and gas drilling has historically been cyclical 
demand tends to be linked to the price of oil and gas and those prices tend to fluctuate depending on many factors  including global economic 
table of contents activity and levels of inventory 
price levels for oil and gas can in themselves cause additional fluctuations by inducing changes in consumer behavior 
the cyclicality of the market is further exacerbated by the tendency in the industry to order capital assets as demand grows  often resulting in new capacity becoming available just as demand for oil and gas is peaking and activity is about to decline 
in late  offshore activity began to decline following a sharp reduction in oil and gas prices 
the decline continued throughout into and the market was further weakened by overcapacity  particularly internationally  following ongoing deliveries of newly built vessels 
this situation is likely to continue into  although the rate of new deliveries should begin to slow down during the second half of the year 
the dynamics of the us gulf of mexico market were significantly impacted by the sinking of the deepwater horizon in april the subsequent oil spill response created an immediate demand for most vessel types from may until october at its peak  the company had vessels deployed on the response 
beyond this short term increase in activity  the us government imposed moratorium on certain drilling activities has caused a significant decline in demand for all vessel types 
although the moratorium has now been lifted  the revised requirements of the deepwater drilling permit process has created a stagnant environment 
this situation is expected to continue in the immediate term 
the company responded to the weak market conditions by cold stacking a number of vessels in the us gulf of mexico 
as of december   the company had vessels cold stacked in the us gulf of mexico 
the term cold stacked means unmanned and not working 
the company continues to monitor market conditions and will cold stack additional vessels  or place vessels back into service  as it deems appropriate 
the continued flow of newly built vessels into the international market has created a situation of oversupply in the north sea  asia  middle east and west africa regions 
this situation is expected to continue throughout reduced activity  combined with tighter capital and credit markets  has created uncertainty over new construction of offshore equipment 
the order book for new equipment remains large but there are uncertainties as to if and when these assets will be delivered 
many of these assets were ordered without firm contractual commitments for employment and should these assets be delivered and placed into service there could be an adverse impact on market conditions 
over the last several years  offshore marine services has disposed of its old generation equipment while taking delivery of new vessels specifically designed to meet the changing requirements of the market 
since december   the average age of the fleet  excluding standby safety vessels  has been reduced from years to years 
offshore marine services enters with a limited order book for new equipment and believes its diverse fleet and broad geographical distribution of vessels will assist in weathering the effects of the industry downturn 
the company s strong financial position should enable offshore marine services to capitalize on opportunities as they develop for purchasing  mobilizing or upgrading vessels to meet changing market conditions 
as of december   offshore marine services had three vessels one anchor handling tug supply and two fast support under construction in the us gulf of mexico 
the number and type of vessels operated  their rates per day worked and their utilization levels are the key determinants of offshore marine services operating results and cash flows 
unless a vessel is cold stacked removed from operational service  there is little reduction in daily running costs and  consequently  operating margins are most sensitive to changes in rates per day worked and utilization 
the aggregate cost of offshore marine services operations depends primarily on the size and asset mix of the fleet 
offshore marine services operating costs and expenses are grouped into the following categories personnel primarily wages  benefits  payroll taxes  savings plans and travel for marine personnel  repairs and maintenance primarily routine repairs and maintenance and main engine overhauls which are performed in accordance with planned maintenance programs  drydocking primarily the cost of regulatory drydockings performed in accordance with applicable regulations  
table of contents insurance and loss reserves primarily the cost of hull and machinery and protection and indemnity insurance premiums and loss deductibles  fuel  lubes and supplies  leased in equipment includes the cost of leasing vessels from lessors under bareboat charter arrangements and leasing equipment employed on vessels  brokered vessel activity the cost of chartering in third party vessels under time charter arrangements to fulfill a customer requirement that cannot be filled by a company owned or managed vessel  and other communication costs  expenses incurred in mobilizing vessels between geographic regions  third party shipmanagement fees  freight expenses  customs and importation duties  and other

table of contents aviation services a significant portion of aviation services operations involves transportation services provided to offshore oil and gas customers and leasing aircraft to third parties 
as discussed in the offshore marine services segment  the offshore oil and gas market is highly cyclical with demand linked to the price of oil and gas that tends to fluctuate depending on many factors  including global economic activity and levels of inventory 
alaska and the us gulf of mexico represent aviation services major oil and gas markets 
during  the market for aviation services assets in the united states was disrupted by the sinking of the deepwater horizon 
in the short term  aviation services benefited by providing helicopters and software systems to support the oil spill response efforts 
at the same time however  the moratorium on certain offshore drilling projects caused a decrease in demand for helicopters supporting oil and gas activities 
while the moratorium has now been lifted  the process of issuing permits to drill has slowed down and continues to have a negative impact on demand 
aviation services does not expect the slowdown will have a significant impact on its future results as its activities are more dependent on longer term production  maintenance and inspection work than short term exploration and development projects 
exploration and development activities generally require medium size and heavy aircraft  which typically earn higher margins 
production related activities are less sensitive to variations in commodity prices and accordingly provide a more stable demand for services 
aviation services has concentrated its production support in deepwater areas and with pipeline companies 
it performs very little shallow water production support 
in recent years  aviation services offshore oil and gas customers have been seeking modern aircraft that offer enhanced safety features and greater performance 
some customers have also been moving from small single engine aircraft to small twin engine aircraft due to the additional safety afforded from two engines when flying extended range missions in deepwater areas 
demand for leased aircraft is influenced by the overall demand for aircraft and the availability of financing to potential customers 
the recent difficulties in the credit market have increased demand for aviation services leased assets 
aviation services  through one of its joint ventures  offer training services to third parties using a mix of classroom instruction  flight training devices and aircraft 
the demand for these services has increased in line with customers efforts to improve safety 
the aggregate cost of aviation services operations depends primarily on the size and asset mix of the fleet 
aviation services operating costs and expenses are grouped into the following categories personnel wages  benefits  payroll taxes  savings plans  training  crew subsistence and travel for aviation personnel  repairs and maintenance primarily routine activities as well as aircraft refurbishments and engine and major component overhauls that are performed in accordance with planned maintenance programs  insurance and loss reserves the cost of hull and machinery and protection and indemnity insurance premiums and loss deductibles  fuel  leased in equipment includes the cost of leasing helicopters and equipment  and other primarily base expenses  property  sales and use taxes  communication costs  freight expenses  and other 
certain third party vendors maintain the engines and certain components on some aircraft under programs that require aviation services to pay ratably for the service based on actual flight hours flown 
the costs are 
table of contents normally billed on a monthly basis and expensed as incurred 
in the event that aviation services places an aircraft in a program after a maintenance period has begun  it may be necessary to pay an initial buy in charge based on hours flown to date with such charge being amortized over the contract period 
if an aircraft is sold before the scheduled maintenance work is carried out  aviation services may be able to recover part of its expenditure

personnel costs were million lower primarily due to a reduction in workforce in both the us gulf of mexico and air medical services in line with the slow down in activity as discussed above 
these reductions were partially offset by increased personnel costs in alaska in support of additional contracts for oil and gas activity 
repair and maintenance costs were million lower primarily due to the timing of repairs 
fuel expense decreased million primarily due to the reduction in flight hours in the us gulf of mexico and lower activity levels at the fbo following the loss of a significant customer 
other operating expenses were lower in due to the receipt of insurance reimbursements in for expenses incurred following hurricanes gustav and ike in inland river services historically  activity levels for grain exports and non grain imports are the key drivers in determining freight rates 
during  grain exports were marginally higher than in early in  export demand for corn was weak due to cheaper feed grain availability elsewhere 
this decrease in exports coupled with an oversupply of barges led to equipment being idled in the early spring 
the market improved in the early summer as asian demand for corn supported freight values and continued as drought conditions in russia in late july further influenced demand 
market conditions during parts of resulted in more dry cargo barges earning demurrage 
imports were essentially flat  continuing at or near levels  in line with the ongoing economic recession in the united states with low levels of demand for construction related materials and other industrial cargos 
weather conditions presented persistent challenges to the industry during at the start of the year  ice  fog and high water limited operations and caused delays on the illinois and lower mississippi rivers 
another wet spring exacerbated the high water conditions and restricted tow sizes throughout much of the spring and early summer 
in late summer  warm  dry weather throughout much of the midwest allowed for ideal towing conditions but as the dry weather continued into the fall  water levels fell and river conditions deteriorated leading to restricted drafts 
in december  winter arrived early and ice  low water and cold temperatures further hampered operating conditions 
at the end of  the average age of the inland river services dry cargo barge fleet was years old  which the company believes is among the youngest fleets operating on the us inland river waterways system 
inland river services believes that approximately of the dry cargo barge fleet operating on the us inland river waterways is over years old 
inland river services expects the relatively young age of its dry cargo barge fleet to enhance its availability and reliability  reduce downtime for repairs and limit replacement capital expenditures required to maintain its fleet size and revenue generating capacity

marine transportation services demand for the company s tankers is dependent on several factors  including petroleum production and refining activity levels in the united states  domestic consumer and commercial consumption of petroleum products  and chemicals and competition from foreign imports of oil products 
during and  orders placed by industry participants for the construction of new double hulled vessels qualified for operation in the us coastwise trade created uncertainty as to whether the market would be able to absorb such additional capacity 
in response to the uncertainty of both demand and supply factors and in order to secure a portion of the fleet s future earnings  marine transportation services entered into long term arrangements to bareboat charter out four vessels with staggered delivery dates 
the first vessel began its charter in march  the second in september  the third in january  and the fourth in october of as of december   the company believes third parties had contracted to build approximately eight us flag tank vessels that could compete with marine transportation services equipment

the seabulk america contributed operating revenues of million from the beginning of the year through its lay up in august compared with operating revenues

environmental services environmental services charges fees for its consulting and industrial and remediation services on both a time and material basis and on a fixed fee bid basis 
in both cases the total fees charged are dependent upon the scope of work to be accomplished and the labor and equipment required to carry it out 
the margins on time and material services are more predictable and for the most part are larger than for fixed fee work 
the margins on equipment intensive jobs are normally higher than labor intensive jobs 
operating results and cash flows can be very dependent on the number of emergency responses in a given fiscal period  the magnitude of each emergency and the profit margin earned 
consequently  emergency response revenues and related income can vary materially between comparable periods 
the revenues from any one period are not indicative of a trend or anticipated results in future periods 
environmental services operating results were significantly impacted by its involvement in the oil spill response 
costs of emergency response activities can include payments to sub contractors for labor  equipment and materials and or the direct charge of labor  equipment and materials provided by environmental services 
profit margins vary based on the use of the company s personnel and equipment resources versus the use of third party personnel and equipment 
the principal components of environmental services operating expenses are salaries and related benefits for operating personnel  payments to subcontractors  equipment maintenance and depreciation 
these expenses are primarily a function of regulatory requirements and the level of retainer  spill  consulting and other environmental business activities

realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives not designated as hedges are reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of income as derivative gains losses  net

the company records write downs  as needed  to adjust the carrying amount of inventories to the lower of cost or market 
property and equipment 
equipment  stated at cost  is depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset to an estimated salvage value 
with respect to each class of asset  the estimated useful life is typically based upon a newly built asset being placed into service and represents the point at which it is typically not justifiable for the company to continue to operate the asset in the same or similar manner 
from time to time  the company may acquire older assets that have already exceeded the company s useful life policy  in which case the company depreciates such assets based on its best estimate of remaining useful life  typically the next survey or certification date 

table of contents as of december   the estimated useful life in years of each of the company s major classes of new equipment was as follows offshore support vessels helicopters inland river dry cargo and deck barges inland river liquid tank barges inland river towboats us flag tankers harbor and offshore tugs ocean liquid tank barges subject to oil pollution act of opa requirements 
effective april   the company changed its estimated useful life for newly built harbor and offshore tugs from to years and reduced the remaining useful life of certain vessels within its harbor and offshore tug fleet due to the more frequent occurrence of technological advancements in vessel design 
these changes in estimates did not materially impact the comparability of financial information for the periods presented 
equipment maintenance and repair costs and the costs of routine overhauls  drydockings and inspections performed on vessels and equipment are charged to operating expense as incurred 
expenditures that extend the useful life or improve the marketing and commercial characteristics of equipment as well as major renewals and improvements to other properties are capitalized 
certain third party vendors maintain helicopter components and engines on some of the company s helicopters under programs that require the company to pay ratably for the service based on flight hours flown 
these costs are normally billed monthly and expensed as incurred 
in the event the company places a helicopter in a program after a maintenance period has begun  it may be necessary to pay an initial buy in charge based on hours flown to date with such charge being amortized over the contract period

the impact of the entry into and exit from these programs could have a significant impact on the company s repair and maintenance costs 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company performs an impairment analysis of long lived assets used in operations  including intangible assets  when indicators of impairment are present 
if the carrying value of the assets is not recoverable  as determined by the estimated undiscounted cash flows  the carrying value of the assets is reduced to fair value 
generally  fair value is determined using valuation techniques  such as expected discounted cash flows or appraisals  as appropriate 
impairment of or less owned companies 
the company performs regular reviews of each investee s financial condition  the business outlook for its products and services  and its present and projected results and cash flows 
when an investee has experienced consistent declines in financial performance or difficulties in raising capital to continue operations  and when the company expects the decline to be other than temporary  the investment is written down to fair value 
actual results may vary from estimates due to the uncertainty regarding the projected financial performance of investees  the severity and expected duration of declines in value  and the available liquidity in the capital markets to support the continuing operations of the investees in which the company has investments 
goodwill 
goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the company performs an annual impairment test of goodwill and further periodic tests to the extent indicators of impairment develop between annual impairment tests 
the company s impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value  including the goodwill related to the reporting unit 
to determine the fair value of the reporting unit  the company uses a discounted future cash flow approach that uses estimates for revenues  costs and appropriate 
table of contents discount rates  among others 
these estimates are reviewed each time the company tests goodwill for impairment and are typically developed as part of the company s routine business planning and forecasting process 
while the company believes its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  variations from those estimates could produce materially different results 
income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities have been provided in recognition of the income tax effect attributable to the book and tax basis differences of assets and liabilities reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets or liabilities are provided using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which they are expected to be settled or realized
