item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to our financial statements for the year ended december  the application of these policies requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on a combination of historical experience and reasonable judgment applied to other facts 
actual results may differ from these estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
in addition  the use of different assumptions or judgments may result in different estimates 
we believe our critical accounting policies that are subject to these estimates are revenue recognition and accounts receivable reserves  inventory valuation  stock based compensation  and valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable reserves we defer revenue recognition on products sold to distributors until our distributors sell the products to their customers  because our distributors generally have rights to return products to us for stock rotation  stock reduction  or replacement of defective product 
the amount of deferred revenue net of related cost of revenue is classified as deferred income on shipments to distributors on our balance sheet 
we use inventory reports received from our distributors at the end of each reporting period to determine the extent of inventory at the distributor  and thus  the amount of income to defer 
stock rotation and stock reduction from our distributors generally results in a balance sheet adjustment to our deferred income and does not impact our revenue or cost of revenue 
we generally recognize revenues on sales to customers other than distributors upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured  there are no customer acceptance requirements  and there are no remaining significant obligations 
most of our customers other than distributors do not have rights of return except under warranty 
we also earn revenue from an extended warranty service program offered on select products 
revenues from the extended warranty service program are recognized ratably over the life of the extended warranty contract 
the amount of unrecognized warranty service revenue is classified as deferred service revenue and presented on our balance sheet in its short and long term components 
we also earn revenue from services performed in connection with consulting arrangements 
for those contracts that include contract milestones or acceptance criteria we recognize revenue as such milestones are achieved or as such acceptance occurs 
in some instances the acceptance criteria in the contract requires acceptance after all services are complete and all other elements have been delivered  in which case revenue recognition is deferred until those requirements are met 
we estimate the amount of uncollectible receivables at the end of each reporting period based on the aging of the receivable balance  historical trends  and communications with our customers 
if actual bad debts are significantly different from our estimates our operating results will be affected 

table of contents inventory valuation our inventories primarily consist of component parts used to assemble our products after we receive orders from our customers 
we purchase or have manufactured the component parts required by our engineering bill of materials 
the timing and quantity of our purchases are based on order forecasts  the lead time requirements of our vendors  and on economic order quantities 
at the end of each reporting period  we compare our inventory on hand to our forecasted requirements for the next nine month period  and write off the cost of any inventory that is surplus  less any amounts that we believe we can recover from disposal of goods that we specifically believe will be saleable past a nine month horizon 
our sales forecasts are based upon historical trends  communications from customers  and marketing data regarding market trends and dynamics  which we discuss in item  business 
surplus or obsolete inventory can also be created by changes to our engineering bill of materials 
charges for the amounts we record as surplus or obsolete inventory are included in cost of revenue 
stock based compensation on january   we began accounting for share based awards to employees  including grants of employee stock options  in our financial statements based on the fair values of the share based awards 
we use a binomial lattice valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants made on or after january  the binomial lattice model incorporates calculations for expected volatility  risk free interest rates  employee exercise patterns and post vesting employment termination behavior  and these factors affect the estimate of the fair value of the stock option grants 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
a two step test is required to be performed to assess goodwill for impairment 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test requires a determination of whether the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed 
the second step is performed only if the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
the second step involves an analysis reflecting the allocation of fair value determined in the first step as if it was the purchase price in a business combination 
this process may result in the determination of a new amount of goodwill 
if the calculated fair value of the goodwill resulting from this allocation is lower than the carrying value of the goodwill in the reporting unit  the difference is reflected as a non cash impairment loss 
the purpose of the second step is only to determine the amount of goodwill that should be recorded on the balance sheet 
the recorded amounts of other items on the balance sheet are not adjusted 
we have determined that we have one reporting unit for purposes of goodwill testing 
we estimate the fair value of our single reporting unit utilizing up to three valuation methods market capitalization  income approach and market approach 
revenue and expense forecasts used in the evaluation of goodwill are based on trends of historical performance and our estimate of future performance 
we assess the impairment of certain long lived assets  including intangible assets with definite useful lives  at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

table of contents revenues our revenues have been classified into three primary product families for the years ended december    and additionally  we continue to carry legacy plug in connectivity products  and up through carried serial products until the sale of our serial product line in the third quarter of our product revenues are presented in the following table revenues in thousands years ended december  increase decrease vs 
vs 
product family s s s s s s mobile handheld computer products data collection products oem embedded products other connectivity serial interface total our mobile handheld computer product revenues in increased by  or  from mobile handheld computer product revenues in sales of our mobile handheld computer through the first nine months of increased by compared to the same period in  due to an increase in the volume of mobile handheld computer sales combined with an increase in related service revenues as a result of an increased percentage of customers opting to purchase our socketcare extended warranty and accidental breakage coverage in conjunction with their deployments 
however  in the fourth quarter  sales of our mobile handheld computer products were reduced as a result of shortages in the availability of lcd touch screens used in the manufacture of our mobile handheld computer 
beginning in late  major tablet and smartphone manufacturers secured a majority of the lcd touch screen manufacturing capacity causing short term supply disruptions as lcd touch screen manufacturers reprioritized their capacity commitments 
our mobile handheld product revenues in the fourth quarter declined to million from million in the third quarter as a consequence of the supply delays and our inability to ship our customer orders scheduled for shipment in the fourth quarter 
increased revenues in from our mobile handheld computer products reflect higher sales volumes due to a growing customer base with larger average unit deployments compared to although the annual revenues in indicate growth in our mobile handheld computer revenues  we believe this growth was slowed by the worldwide economic slowdown beginning in late  as our customers took longer to make their deployment decisions 
in the second half of mobile handheld computer revenues declined by compared to the first half of due to the completion of a year long roll out to a key customer in the healthcare market early in the third quarter 
declines in sales to this key customer in the second half of were partially offset by growth in sales to existing customers in healthcare and other markets  which grew at a rate of in the second half of compared to the first half 

table of contents our data collection product revenues in decreased by million from data collection revenues in revenue decreases in were primarily from declines of million in sales of our sdio in hand scan card due to reduced sales volumes of this product 
remaining declines in were from reduced sales of our cordless hand scanner and cordless ring scanner 
sales of our compactflash in hand scan card were flat in compared to our data collection product revenues continue to be affected by the worldwide economic slowdown as customers defer their deployment decisions 
a significant sales volume of our plug in scan cards are sold in conjunction with our mobile handheld computer 
in the fourth quarter in particular  supply delays in our mobile handheld computer mentioned previously  adversely impacted our mobile handheld computer sales and consequently the companion plug in scan card revenues as we were forced to defer shipments beyond year end 
in  our data collection product revenues decreased by million from data collection revenues in the decrease was due to a decline of million in sales of our compactflash in hand scan card product  a decline of million in sales of our cordless hand scanner  a decline million in sales of our sdio in hand scan card  and a decline in sales of our cordless ring scanner 
revenue declines in were due primarily to lower sales volumes of these primary scanning products due to the effects of the worldwide economic slowdown which began in the fourth quarter of service revenues from our socketcare extended warranty program were million or of our revenue in and approximately million or percent of our revenue in service revenues were insignificant for increases in socketcare service revenues are due to an increased percentage of customers opting to purchase our socketcare extended warranty and accidental breakage coverage in conjunction with their mobile handheld computer and data collection deployments 
revenues related to our socketcare services have been allocated to the respective mobile handheld computer and data collection revenues for each of the years presented in the table above 
our oem embedded product revenues declined in by million from revenues in approximately half of the revenue decrease was due to reduced sales of bluetooth products 
sales of our bluetooth modules to our oem customers declined as a result of phasing out older bluetooth technology and a last buy purchase program through sales of bluetooth plug in products declined as a result of last buys of these products as we completed the phase out of these products in remaining declines in the were from reductions in sales of our wireless lan plug in cards 
in  our oem embedded product revenues declined by million from revenues in revenue decreases of million in were from reduced sales of our bluetooth modules to our oem customers as a result of phasing out older bluetooth technology and a last buy purchase program mentioned previously 
our oem customers made last buy bluetooth module purchases beginning in the third quarter of  with the majority of these shipments occurring in the latter half of  followed by the final remaining shipments completed primarily in the first quarter of additional declines in of million were from reductions in sales of our wireless lan plug in cards 
remaining declines in were from reduced sales of our bluetooth plug in cards  a trend that continued from  reflecting lower overall requirements for these products by our oem customers and the availability of this wireless technology already built into handheld computers to our non oem customers 
partially offsetting these declines in were increases of million in sales of our wireless lan modules 

table of contents our connectivity product revenues for the three years presented in the above table consist of ethernet plug in cards  modems  and accessory products including our mobile power pack  adapters and cables 
connectivity product revenues in decreased by million from connectivity product revenues in  and connectivity revenues in decreased by million from connectivity product revenues in the decrease in was primarily due to declines in sales of our modem plug in products with remaining declines from reduced sales of our ethernet plug in products 
the decrease in was due primarily to a decline of million from reduced sales of our modem plug in products with remaining declines from reduced sales of our ethernet plug in products 
overall connectivity product revenues have declined in the periods presented  reflecting a trend of year over year reductions in corporate deployments of these wired connection solutions as most users of mobile computing devices now connect to networks wirelessly 
as a result of the sale of our serial product technology and business on september   there are no revenues from serial interface products recognized beyond fiscal our serial interface product revenues declined in by million from revenues in the decrease in was primarily from declines of million in sales of our standard serial pc card products with additional declines due to lower sales of our bluetooth serial adapter product  which were due in part to the sale of our serial product line to quatech  inc on september  see note sale of product line assets for more information 
our standard serial pc card products were primarily sold to connect peripheral devices or other electronic equipment to notebook computers 
overall serial product revenues have declined in the periods presented through the date of sale of the product line  continuing a trend reflecting the gradual replacement of serial technology with usb and other newer connection technologies 
gross margins gross margins for were of revenues compared to gross margins of in and in we generally price our products as a markup from our cost  and we offer discount pricing for higher volume purchases 
declines in overall margins in compared to were due to declines in sales of above average margin products combined with fixed overhead costs which comprised a greater portion of the overall cost of goods sold due to lower revenues in compared to partially offsetting these margin declines in were increases in sales of our mobile handheld computer which comprised a greater portion of our overall revenues combined with improved margins on this particular product in compared to one year ago 
reductions in overall margins in compared to were due primarily to increased sales of our mobile handheld computer which comprised of our revenues in compared to in margins on our mobile handheld computer were below our average product margins  and combined with a greater proportion of our revenues in  resulted in overall margin reductions compared to additional margin declines in were due to our fixed overhead costs  which comprise a greater portion of the overall revenues and cost of goods sold due to lower revenues in compared to 
table of contents research and development expense research and development expense in was million  a decrease of from research and development expense in of million 
research and development expense in decreased by from research and development expense in of million 
in we continued the implementation of cost reduction programs in response to the economic climate 
approximately if the reduction in research and development expense in compared to was due to lower personnel costs primarily from salary reductions 
remaining reductions in research and development expense in were primarily from reduced development costs due to a reduction in product development activities  and reduced equipment costs related to the reductions in product development activities 
sixty three percent of the reduction in research and development expense in was due to reduced personnel costs as the result of a reduction in force action initiated in the fourth quarter of  followed by additional reductions in employee compensation and related expense in in the fourth quarter of the company initiated a range of expense reductions across all departments and functional expense categories in response to the worldwide economic slowdown  with additional reductions following in the first and second quarters of  and a continuation of the reduced expense levels throughout the remaining quarters of additional reductions in research and development expense in were from decreases in development fees due to a reduction in product development activities  and decreases in equipment costs related to the reductions in product development activities 
sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense in was million  a decrease of compared to sales and marketing expense in of million 
sales and marketing expense in decreased by compared to sales and marketing expense in of million 
approximately half of the reduction in sales and marketing expense in was from reduced personnel costs due to salary reductions and realignment of the sales force to emphasize inside sales personnel located at the company newark  ca headquarters to better serve our customer base 
additional declines in were primarily from reduced advertising and promotion expense and travel costs 
seventy five percent of the reduction in sales and marketing expense in was due to reduced personnel costs as a result of the reduction in force action initiated in the fourth quarter of referred to above and further reductions in employee compensation and related expense during additional reductions in sales and marketing expense in were in the categories of advertising and promotion expense  travel  outside services  and equipment costs 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense in was million  an increase of compared to general and administrative expense of million in general and administrative expense in decreased compared to general and administrative expense of million in in the fourth quarter  non recurring expenses totaling million related to the closing of our senior convertible note financing in november  were charged to general and administrative expense 
excluding this fourth quarter non recurring financing cost  remaining general and administrative expenses in decreased from comparable expenses in reductions in comparable general and administrative expense in were primarily from salary reductions  reduced occupancy costs and lower consulting and professional fees 
partially offsetting these reductions in in comparable expenses were increases in fees associated with our bank line of credit through the date of termination on november  and an increase in stock compensation expense related to the stock option exchange completed on july  in  over half of the reduction in expense was due to decreases in payroll costs primarily from reductions in employee compensation expense for the year 
additional reductions in general and administrative expense in compared to  were primarily from decreases in consulting and professional fees and reduced investor relations expense 

table of contents amortization of intangibles in july we acquired a patent which covers the design and functioning of plug in bar code scanners  bar code imagers  and radio frequency identification products 
the patent was purchased for  and has been capitalized as an intangible asset 
the patent is being amortized on a straight line basis over a ten year period 
intangible assets of  remaining from a prior acquisition in consisted of developed software and technology with estimated lives at the time of acquisition of years 
such amount was fully amortized by mid total amortization charges in for all acquired intangibles were  compared to  in  and  in the lower annual amortization charges are due to components of intangible property becoming fully amortized 
future intangible amortization charges are solely related to the patent acquired in  and will be  per quarter going forward until fully amortized in june goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of september th or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our single reporting unit more likely than not exceeds its fair value 
we performed the annual goodwill impairment analysis as of september  we used the two step test as required to assess goodwill for impairment 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test consisted of comparing the carrying value of our reporting unit to its fair value 
we estimated the fair value of our reporting unit using various methods and compared the fair value to the carrying amount net book value to ascertain if potential goodwill impairment existed 
we utilized methods that focused on our ability to produce income income approach and the estimated consideration we would receive if there were a sale of the company market approach 
key assumptions utilized in the determination of fair value in step one of the test included the following our market capitalization  market multiples of comparable companies within our industry  revenue and expense forecasts used in the evaluation were based on trends of historical performance and our estimate of future performance  cash flows utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis were estimated using a weighted average cost of capital determined to be appropriate for the company 
the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and as a result  goodwill was considered not impaired as of september   the date of our annual test for impairment 
during the fourth quarter of  we also performed an update to the goodwill impairment analysis 
we determined goodwill was not impaired as of december  as a result of our analysis 
the factors used in performing a goodwill impairment analysis are highly subjective and may be adversely affected by our future financial results and market conditions  and may result in future impairment write downs 
in the fourth quarter indications of impairment existed subsequent to the annual impairment test at september   and as a result we performed additional impairment testing with the assistance of a third party valuation specialist 
based on the impairment analysis at december   we recorded a preliminary estimate of  of goodwill impairment 
in the quarter ended march   we finalized the impairment analysis without adjustment to the estimated impairment recorded at december  
table of contents interest income and other  and interest expense interest income reflects interest earned on cash balances 
interest income in and was immaterial compared to interest income of  in lower interest income in the comparable periods reflects lower average cash balances combined with lower average rates of return 
interest expense was  in compared to  in  and  in interest expense is primarily related to interest on amounts drawn on our bank lines of credit through the date of termination of the credit lines in november  and in and also included interest related to a term loan outstanding which was repaid in full in december in conjunction with a new credit line agreement at that time 
additional interest expense is related to interest on equipment lease financing obligations in each of the years presented  and beginning in november  interest on our senior convertible note payable and the related amortization of debt discount recognized in interest expense 
higher overall interest expense in compared to is due to the portion of debt discount amortized in higher interest expense in compared to was due to higher average balances outstanding on our bank lines of credit at higher overall interest rates 
if unconverted for the duration of fiscal  the annual interest expense on our senior convertible note will be  and the annual amortization of the related debt discount to be charged to interest expense will be approximately  see note senior convertible note financing for more information 
income taxes deferred tax expense of  in  a deferred tax benefit of  in  and deferred tax expense of  in  and the corresponding deferred tax liability shown on our balance sheet  is related entirely to the deferred tax liability on the portion of our goodwill amortized for tax purposes 
due to the indefinite characteristic of this deferred tax liability  it cannot be offset against deferred tax assets 
goodwill impairment charges recorded at december  on that portion of our goodwill being amortized for tax purposes resulted in the reversal of accumulated deferred tax expense in and the related deferred tax liability  temporarily eliminating the difference between financial and tax reporting at december   and through the first half of beginning in the third quarter  differences between financial and tax reporting resulted in deferred tax expense of  and the corresponding deferred tax liability on our balance sheet at december  we maintain a full valuation allowance for all other components of deferred tax assets 
there can be no assurance that the deferred tax assets subject to the valuation allowance will be realized 
we have not generated taxable income in any periods in any jurisdiction  foreign or domestic 

table of contents quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth summary quarterly statements of operations data for each of the quarters in and this unaudited quarterly information has been prepared on the same basis as the annual information presented elsewhere herein  and  in our opinion  includes all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring entries necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the quarters presented 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period

we generally ship orders as received and therefore quarterly revenue and operating results depend on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
historically  we have recognized a substantial portion of our revenue in the last month of the quarter 
operating results may also fluctuate due to factors such as the demand for our products  the size and timing of customer orders  the introduction of new products and product enhancements by us or our competitors  product mix  timing of software enhancements  manufacturing supply shortages  changes in the level of operating expenses  and competitive conditions in the industry 
because our staffing and other operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue  a substantial portion of which is not typically generated until the end of each quarter  delays in the receipt of orders can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources during the years ended december    and  we incurred net losses of million  million  million  respectively 
as of december   we have an accumulated deficit of million and a working capital deficit of million 
these are conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
these conditions include continuing operating losses and declines in our working capital balances 
our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to establish profitable operations and to increase our capital 
we have been taking steps intended to reduce operating losses and achieve profitability including the introduction of new products  continued close support of our distributors and of our application partners as they establish their mobile applications in key vertical markets  and management of our costs 
we have the ability to reduce expenses further if necessary 
we believe that we will be able to improve liquidity and secure additional sources of financing by managing our working capital balances  improving our operating results to cash positive levels  and raising additional capital as needed  including development funding from development partners and through the issuance of additional equity securities 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving any of these steps  and there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  and any such terms may be dilutive to existing stockholders 
our inability to secure and maintain the necessary liquidity would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to secure the necessary capital for our business  we may need to suspend some or all of our current operations 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
if we can return to revenue growth and attain profitability  we anticipate requirements for cash will include funding of higher receivable and inventory balances  and increased expenses  including more employees to support our growth and increases in salaries  benefits  and related support costs for employees 
we have a history of operating losses and we may continue to be unprofitable in the foreseeable future 
historically we have financed our operations through the sale of equity securities  equipment financing  and revolving bank lines of credit 
since our inception we have raised approximately million in equity capital to fund our operations 
as reflected in our statements of cash flows  net cash used in operating activities was million in compared to million provided from operating activities in  and million used in operating activities in we calculate net cash used in operating activities by reducing our net loss million  million  and million in   and  respectively by those expenses that did not require the use of cash  and reversing gains that did not generate cash 
these items consist of stock based compensation expense  depreciation  amortization of intangible assets  changes in inventory reserves  deferred tax expense  and in in particular  the issuance of common stock for services and the amortization of debt discount  and in in particular  a reversal of deferred tax expense 
these amounts totaled million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
also  in our net loss includes a gain of  from the sale of our serial product line assets in september of see note sale of product line assets for more information and goodwill impairment charges of million 
we adjusted the net loss for to exclude this gain and the impairment charges 
increases in non cash charges in were primarily from increases in deferred tax expense  increases in inventory write downs  and charges related to our senior convertible note financing including amortization of debt discount and common stock warrants issued for services 
partially offsetting these increases in non cash charges in were decreases in depreciation expense due to reductions in the purchasing of equipment and tooling  and decreases in stock based compensation expense compared to reductions in non cash items in were primarily from the deferred tax expense reversal related to the impairment charges on the portion of our goodwill being amortized for tax purposes and reductions in amortization expense due to components of our intangible assets becoming fully amortized  partially offset by an increase in inventory write downs compared to 
table of contents in addition  we report increases in assets and reductions in liabilities as uses of cash and decreases in assets and increases in liabilities as sources of cash  together referred to as changes in operating assets and liabilities

in  changes in operating assets and liabilities resulted in a net source of cash of million and were primarily from reductions in inventory due primarily to planned reductions in stocking levels of our mobile handheld computer from year end inventory levels  reductions in accounts receivable due to lower shipments in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of  and increases in deferred service revenues  partially offset by reductions in accounts payable due to reductions in overall expenses and inventory purchases that create those payables  and reductions in deferred income on shipments to distributors due to lower stocking levels of our products in the distribution channel 
changes in operating assets and liabilities in were primarily from increased levels of inventories due to stocking higher quantities of our mobile handheld computer and increases in accounts receivable due to shipments concentrated in the last month of the fourth quarter of  partially offset by increases in accounts payable due to the purchases that led to the increased levels of inventories  increases in deferred income on shipments to distributors due to increased stocking levels in the domestic distribution channel  and increases in deferred service revenue

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to invested cash and our bank credit line facilities 
our cash is invested in short term money market investments backed by us treasury notes and other investments that mature within one year and whose principal is not subject to market rate fluctuations 
accordingly  interest rate declines would adversely affect our interest income but would not affect the carrying value of our cash investments 
based on a sensitivity analysis of our cash investments during the quarter ended december   a decline of in interest rates would not have had a material effect on our quarterly interest income 
on november   we terminated our bank credit line facility in conjunction with the issuance of a senior convertible note in the note financing subsequently closed on november  see note bank financing arrangements and note senior convertible note financing for more information 
there is no interest rate risk from our credit line facility beyond the termination date 
foreign currency risk a substantial majority of our revenue  expense and purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  we require our european distributors to purchase our products in euros  we pay the expenses of our european employees in euros and british pounds  and we may enter into selected future purchase commitments with foreign suppliers that may be paid in the local currency of the supplier 
we hedge a significant portion of our european receivables balance denominated in euros to reduce the foreign currency risk associated with these assets  and we have not been subject to significant losses from material foreign currency fluctuations 
based on a sensitivity analysis of our net foreign currency denominated assets and expenses at the beginning  during and at the end of the quarter ended december   an adverse change of in exchange rates would have resulted in an increase in our net loss for the fourth quarter of approximately  if left unprotected 
for the fourth quarter of the total net adjustment for the effects of changes in foreign currency on cash balances  collections  payables  and derivatives was a net gain of  we will continue to monitor  assess  and mitigate through hedging activities  the risk associated with these exposures
