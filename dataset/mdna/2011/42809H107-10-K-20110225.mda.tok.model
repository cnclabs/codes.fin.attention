item a 
risk factors related to our business and operations our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risk factors  including those described below 
the risk factors described below could negatively affect our operations  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations  and as a result  holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments 
it is possible additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future 
our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil  natural gas  refined petroleum products and electricity  which can be very volatile 
our estimated proved reserves  revenue  operating cash flows  operating margins  future earnings and trading operations are highly dependent on the prices of crude oil  natural gas  refined petroleum products and electricity  which are influenced by numerous factors beyond our control 
historically these prices have been very volatile 
the major foreign oil producing countries  including members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec  exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products 
their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters has a significant impact on the oil markets 
the commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil  natural gas  refined petroleum products and electricity 
to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to mitigate commodity price volatility  we may not realize the benefit of price increases above the hedged price 
changes in commodity prices can also have a material impact on collateral and margin requirements under our derivative contracts 
in addition  we utilize significant bank credit facilities to support these collateral and margin requirements 
an inability to renew or replace such credit facilities as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity 
if we fail to successfully increase our reserves  our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted 
we own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time 
replacement of oil and gas production and reserves  including proved undeveloped reserves  is subject to successful exploration drilling  development activities  and enhanced recovery programs 
therefore  future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves 
exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data  which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons 
drilling risks include 
table of contents unexpected adverse conditions  irregularities in pressure or formations  equipment failure  blowouts and weather interruptions 
future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates 
the costs of drilling and development activities have increased in recent years which could negatively affect expected economic returns 
reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition 
although due diligence is used in evaluating acquired oil and gas properties  similar risks may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others 
there are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flow  and actual quantities may be lower than estimated 
numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves 
actual future production  oil and gas prices  revenues  taxes  capital expenditures  operating expenses  and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues 
in addition  reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward revisions based on production performance  purchases or sales of properties  results of future development  prevailing oil and gas prices  production sharing contracts  which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase  and other factors 
we are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business 
federal  state  local  territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims  expropriation or nationalization of property  mandatory government participation  cancellation or amendment of contract rights  and changes in import and export regulations  limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities  as well as other political developments may affect our operations 
we also market motor fuels through lessee dealers and wholesalers in certain states where legislation prohibits producers or refiners of crude oil from directly engaging in retail marketing of motor fuels 
similar legislation has been periodically proposed in various other states 
as a result of the accident in april at the bp operated macondo prospect in the gulf of mexico in which the corporation was not a participant and the ensuing significant oil spill  a temporary drilling moratorium was imposed in the gulf of mexico 
while this moratorium has since been lifted  significant new regulations have been imposed and further legislation and regulations may be proposed  including an increase in the potential liability in the event of an oil spill 
uncertainty continues to exist as to the conditions under which future drilling in the gulf of mexico will occur 
however  the new regulatory environment is expected to result in a longer permitting process and higher costs 
political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business 
some of the international areas in which we operate  and the partners with whom we operate  are politically less stable than other areas and partners 
current political unrest in north africa and the middle east may affect our operations in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally 
the threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry 
our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities 
our oil and gas operations  like those of the industry  are subject to environmental risk such as oil spills  produced water spills  gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage 
for example  the accident at the bp operated macondo prospect in april resulted in a significant release of crude oil which caused extensive environmental and economic damage 
our operations are also subject to numerous united states federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations 
non compliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative  civil or criminal penalties  remedial clean ups and natural resource damages or other liabilities 
in addition  increasingly stringent environmental regulations  particularly relating to the production of motor and other fuels  have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general 
concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of unconventional oil and gas resources  particularly using the process of hydraulic fracturing 
while we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment  regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose temporary moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of delaying and increasing the cost of such operations 

table of contents concerns about climate change may result in significant operational changes and expenditures and reduced demand for our products 
we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern 
continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national  regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions 
these agreements and measures may require significant equipment modifications  operational changes  taxes  or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations  which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance  operating  maintenance and remediation costs 
in addition  we manufacture petroleum fuels  which through normal customer use result in the emission of greenhouse gases 
regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce our sales of  and revenues from  these products 
finally  to the extent that climate change may result in more extreme weather related events  we could experience increased costs related to prevention  maintenance and remediation of affected operations in addition to costs and lost revenues related to delays and shutdowns 
our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than us 
the petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive 
we encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities  including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas  and in purchasing and marketing of refined products  natural gas and electricity 
many competitors  including national oil companies  are larger and have substantially greater resources 
we are also in competition with producers and marketers of other forms of energy 
increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets has significantly increased the cost of acquisitions 
in addition  competition for drilling services  technical expertise and equipment has  in the recent past  affected the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs  resulting in increased capital and operating costs 
catastrophic events  whether naturally occurring or man made  may materially affect our operations and financial conditions 
our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets  interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects 
examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes  fires  explosions and blowouts  such as the accident at the macondo prospect operated by bp in the gulf of mexico 
although we maintain a level of insurance coverage consistent with industry practices against property and casualty losses  there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect the corporation against liability from all potential consequences and damages 
moreover  some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable 
item legal proceedings the corporation  along with many other companies engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline  has been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in gasoline 
a series of similar lawsuits  many involving water utilities or governmental entities  were filed in jurisdictions across the united states against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing mtbe  including the corporation 
the principal allegation in all cases is that gasoline containing mtbe is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe 
in  the majority of the cases against the corporation were settled 
in  additional cases were settled  and three new cases were filed 
the six unresolved cases consist of five cases that have been consolidated for pre trial purposes in the southern district of new york as part of a multi district litigation proceeding and an action brought in state court by the state of new hampshire 
in  a pre tax charge of million was recorded to cover all of the known mtbe cases against the corporation 
over the last several years  many refiners have entered into consent agreements to resolve the united states environmental protection agency s epa assertions that refining facilities were modified or expanded without complying with new source review regulations that require permits and new emission controls in certain circumstances and other regulations that impose emissions control requirements 
these consent agreements  which arise out of an epa enforcement initiative focusing on petroleum refiners and utilities  have typically imposed substantial civil fines and penalties and required i significant capital expenditures to install emissions control equipment over a three to eight year time period and ii changes to operations which resulted in increased operating costs 
the capital expenditures  penalties and supplemental environmental projects for individual 
table of contents refineries covered by the settlements can vary significantly  depending on the size and configuration of the refinery  the circumstances of the alleged modifications and whether the refinery has previously installed more advanced pollution controls 
in january  hovensa signed a consent decree with epa to resolve its claims 
under the terms of the consent decree  hovensa will pay a penalty of approximately million and spend approximately million over the next years to install equipment and implement additional operating procedures at the hovensa refinery to reduce emissions 
in addition  the consent decree requires hovensa to spend approximately million to fund an environmental project to be determined at a later date by the virgin islands and  to assist the virgin islands water and power authority with monitoring 
the consent decree has been lodged with the united states district court for the virgin islands and approval is pending 
in addition  substantial progress has been made towards resolving this matter for the port reading refining facility  which is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the corporation s financial position or results of operations 
on september   hovensa received a notice of violation nov pursuant to section a i of the clean air act act from the epa finding that hovensa failed to obtain proper permitting for the construction and operation of its delayed coking unit in accordance with applicable law and regulations 
hovensa believes it properly obtained all necessary permits for this project 
the nov states that the epa has authority to issue an administrative order assessing penalties for violation of the act 
this matter is resolved by the consent decree discussed above  provided that the consent decree is entered by the court 
in december  hovensa received a nov from the epa alleging non compliance with emissions limits in a permit issued by the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources dpnr for the two process heaters in the delayed coking unit 
the nov was issued in response to a voluntary investigation and submission by hovensa regarding potential non compliance with the permit emissions limits for two pollutants 
any exceedances were minor from the perspective of the amount of pollutants emitted in excess of the limits 
this matter is resolved by the consent decree discussed above  provided that the consent decree is entered by the court 
on december   the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources commenced four separate enforcement actions against hovensa by issuance of documents titled notice of violation  order for corrective action  notice of assessment of civil penalty  notice of opportunity for hearing the novs 
the novs assert violations of virgin islands air pollution control laws and regulations arising out of air release incidents at the hovensa refinery in and and propose total penalties of  hovensa intends to vigorously defend this matter 
the corporation received a directive from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower passaic river and njdep is also seeking natural resource damages 
the directive  insofar as it affects the corporation  relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in newark  new jersey now owned by the corporation 
the corporation and over companies entered into an administrative order on consent with the epa to study the same contamination 
njdep has also sued several other companies linked to a facility considered by the state to be the largest contributor to river contamination 
in january  these companies added third party defendants  including the corporation  to that case 
in june  the epa issued a draft study which evaluated six alternatives for early action  with costs ranging from million to billion 
based on adverse comments from the corporation and others  the epa is reevaluating its alternatives 
in addition  the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the passaic river 
given the ongoing studies  remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time 
based on currently known facts and circumstances  the corporation does not believe that this matter will result in a material liability because its terminal could not have contributed contamination along most of the river s length and did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river sediments  and because there are numerous other parties who will likely share in the cost of remediation and damages 
in july  hess oil virgin islands corp 
hovic  a wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation  and hovensa  each received a letter from the commissioner of the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources and natural resources trustees  advising of the trustee s intention to bring suit against hovic and hovensa under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla 
the letter alleges that hovic and hovensa are potentially responsible for damages to natural resources arising 
table of contents from releases of hazardous substances from the hovensa refinery  which had been operated by hovic until october an action was filed on may  in the district court of the virgin islands against hovensa  hovic and other companies that operated industrial facilities on the south shore of st 
croix asserting that the defendants are liable under cercla and territorial statutory and common law for damages to natural resources 
hovic and hovensa do not believe that this matter will result in a material liability as they believe that they have strong defenses to this complaint  and they intend to vigorously defend this matter 
the corporation periodically receives notices from epa that it is a potential responsible party under the superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites 
under this legislation  all potentially responsible parties are jointly and severally liable 
for certain sites  epa s claims or assertions of liability against the corporation relating to these sites have not been fully developed 
with respect to the remaining sites  epa s claims have been settled  or a proposed settlement is under consideration  in all cases for amounts that are not material 
the ultimate impact of these proceedings  and of any related proceedings by private parties  on the business or accounts of the corporation cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of clean up cost estimates  but is not expected to be material 
the corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings  including proceedings relating to other environmental matters 
the corporation cannot predict with certainty if  how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief  if any  may be  particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages 
numerous issues may need to be resolved  including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding 
subject to the foregoing  in management s opinion  based upon currently known facts and circumstances  the outcome of such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the corporation  although the outcome of such proceedings could be material to the corporation s results of operations and cash flows for a particular period depending on  among other things  the level of the corporation s net income for such period

the corporation also completed the acquisition of american oil gas inc american oil gas through the issuance of approximately million shares of the corporation s stock  which further increased its acreage position in the bakken by approximately  net acres 
after these acquisitions  the corporation holds more than  net acres in the bakken 
the properties acquired are located near the corporation s existing acreage 
in september  the corporation completed the exchange of its interests in gabon and the clair field in the united kingdom for additional interests in the valhall and hod fields of and  respectively 
this non monetary exchange  which was recorded at fair value  resulted in a pre tax gain of  million  million after income taxes 
the corporation also completed the acquisition of an additional interest in the valhall field and interest in the hod field for million in cash 
as a result of these transactions  the corporation s interests in the valhall and hod fields increased to and  respectively 
in the fourth quarter  the corporation completed the acquisition of an additional interest in the tubular bells oil and gas field in the gulf of mexico for approximately million 
the corporation now has a working interest and is operator of the field 
in january  the corporation completed the sale of its interest in the jambi merang natural gas development project in indonesia hess for cash proceeds of million 
the transaction resulted in a gain of million 
in march  the corporation agreed to the sale of its interests in a package of natural gas production and transportation assets in the united kingdom north sea 
the package includes the corporation s interests in the easington catchment area hess  the bacton area hess  the everest field hess  the lomond field hess and the central area transmission system cats pipeline hess 
in february  the corporation completed the sale of the producing assets for approximately million  
table of contents after closing adjustments 
the sale of the corporation s interest in the cats pipeline is expected to close in the second quarter of in september  the corporation recorded an impairment charge and dry hole expense totaling million before income taxes million after income taxes to reduce the carrying value of unproved property and suspended well costs relating to its interest in the west mediterranean block concession west med block  located offshore egypt 
in the carnarvon basin offshore western australia  the corporation drilled exploration wells in on wa p block hess 
the corporation has drilled all commitment wells on the block  of which were natural gas discoveries 
in the fourth quarter of  the corporation commenced an appraisal program that includes further drilling and flow testing certain wells 
on the pony project in green canyon block hess in the deepwater gulf of mexico  the corporation has signed a non binding agreement in principle with the owners on the adjacent green canyon block that outlines a proposal to jointly develop the pony and knotty head fields 
the corporation also spud and subsequently suspended an appraisal well on the pony prospect in the corporation is planning to resume drilling of the pony appraisal well in contingent upon receipt of necessary drilling permits 
in november  the third exploration well was spud on block bm s hess offshore brazil which encountered noncommercial quantities of hydrocarbons 
as a result  dry hole expenses totaling million million after tax were recorded relating to this well and the previously suspended azul o well  which was drilled in gulf of mexico update in april  an accident occurred on the transocean deepwater horizon drilling rig at the bp plc bp operated macondo prospect in the gulf of mexico  resulting in loss of life  the sinking of the rig and a significant crude oil spill 
the corporation was not a participant in the well 
as a result of the accident  a temporary drilling moratorium was imposed in the gulf of mexico 
in october  the drilling moratorium was lifted by the united states department of the interior s bureau of ocean energy management  regulation and enforcement boemre provided operators complied with all rules and requirements  including a series of new drilling and safety rules issued by boemre 
the corporation is currently evaluating the impact of these new requirements on its activities in the gulf of mexico  as well as seeking approvals for plans and permits submitted in connection with planned activities 
however  the new regulatory environment is expected to result in a longer permitting process and higher costs 
the moratorium impacted development drilling at the shenzi field  in which the corporation has a interest 
a production well that was being drilled was suspended and the drilling of a second production well that was planned for was postponed 
the corporation estimates that these delays reduced production by approximately  boepd and will likely reduce production by approximately  boepd 
in  the corporation s only operated drilling rig in the gulf of mexico  the stena forth  left the pony project on green canyon as part of a preexisting agreement for a one well farm out of the rig to another operator 
in january  the boemre announced that supplementary environmental reviews will not be required of companies to resume work on the wells that were in progress when the moratorium took effect  including the aforementioned suspended shenzi and pony wells 
however  these projects must comply with the new safety rules and regulations before work can resume 
as a result  the corporation does not anticipate that it will be able to re commence these operations before the second half of additionally  the corporation has filed suspension of operations soo applications with the boemre for several exploration block licenses in the gulf of mexico that are due to expire in and may file additional applications as deemed necessary 
these soo applications seek approval for extension of the lease expiration terms due to circumstances outside the control of the corporation that have delayed activities required to hold the licenses

the items in the table below are explained on pages through millions of dollars exploration and production marketing and refining corporate in the discussion that follows  the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after tax basis 
management reviews segment earnings on an after tax basis and uses after tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings 
management believes that after tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings  since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre tax amount 
after tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre tax amounts

barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence as the equivalent price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil over the recent past 
see the average selling prices in the table above 
united states crude oil and natural gas production in the united states was higher in compared with  primarily due to production from the shenzi  llano  conger and bakken fields 
crude oil and natural gas production was higher in compared with  primarily due to new production from the shenzi field and production resuming after the hurricanes 
hurricane impacts reduced full year production by an estimated  boepd 
europe crude oil production was higher in compared with  due to higher production in russia and an increase in norway following the acquisition of additional interests in the valhall and hod fields  partially offset by lower production in the united kingdom north sea following the exchange of clair for additional norway interests 
crude oil production was comparable in and  as higher production in russia offset lower production in the united kingdom north sea 
natural gas production was lower in compared with  primarily due to downtime at certain united kingdom gas fields 
natural gas production was lower in compared with  primarily due to decline and subsequent cessation of production at the atlantic and cromarty fields 
africa crude oil production decreased in compared with following the exchange of gabon for additional interests in the valhall and hod fields in norway in the third quarter and lower entitlement to algerian production 
crude oil production decreased in compared with  primarily due to lower production from the ceiba field 
asia and other natural gas production in was lower than in  primarily due to downtime at the pangkah field and a temporary shut in at the bumi field in the joint development area of malaysia thailand jda 
natural gas production in was higher than in  primarily due to a full year of phase sales from jda

effective december   the securities and exchange commission sec issued updated standards for oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure 
the new rules allow  among other changes  the use of permitted technology in determining oil and gas reserve estimates 
since it was not practical to calculate reserve estimates under both the old and the new reserve estimation standards  it was not possible to precisely measure the effect of adopting the new sec requirements on total proved reserves at december  however  the corporation estimates that applying the new rules increased income during by approximately million  after income taxes  due to lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense

estimated future purchases amount to approximately billion annually using year end prices  which have been included in the table through in the preceding table  the corporation s supply commitments include its estimated purchases of of hovensa s production of refined products  after anticipated sales by hovensa to unaffiliated parties 
the value of future supply commitments will fluctuate based on prevailing market prices  actual refinery output and the amount of product sold by hovensa to unaffiliated third parties 
under the product sales agreement between the corporation and hovensa  hovensa is entitled to reserve refined products for sale to unaffiliated third parties each month up to a maximum amount set by the executive committee of hovensa annually 
the corporation is obligated to purchase of the remaining refined products produced by hovensa  including amounts reserved for third party sales by hovensa that remain unsold 
the prices at which the corporation purchases refined products are determined by reference to published market prices prevailing at the time of purchase 
the amount of the purchase commitment from hovensa is based on the forecasted refinery output that is expected to be sold to the corporation calculated using year end prices

risk factors related to our business and operations 
accounting policies critical accounting policies and estimates accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities on the corporation s balance sheet and revenues and expenses on the income statement 
the accounting methods used can affect net income  equity and various financial statement ratios 
however  the corporation s accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity 
accounting for exploration and development costs exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method 
costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage  including lease bonuses  brokers fees and other related costs  are capitalized 
annual lease rentals  exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred 
costs of drilling and equipping productive wells  including development dry holes  and related production facilities are capitalized 
in production operations  costs of injected co for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred 
the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found 
exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project 
if either of those criteria is not met  or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project  the capitalized well costs are charged to expense 
indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel  active negotiations for sales contracts with customers  negotiations with governments  operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors 

table of contents crude oil and natural gas reserves the sec revised its oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements effective for year end reporting 
in addition  the financial accounting standards board fasb revised its accounting standard on oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures 
the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities 
the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations  the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment  as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill 
for reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions  operating methods and government regulations 
in addition  government and project operator approvals must be obtained and  depending on the amount of the project cost  senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project 
the corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties 
the corporation s technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells  performance reviews  new technical data and other studies 
to provide consistency throughout the corporation  standard reserve estimation guidelines  definitions  reporting reviews and approval practices are used 
the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review 
the corporation also engages an independent third party consulting firm to audit approximately of the corporation s total proved reserves 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill as explained below there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing 
the corporation reviews long lived assets  including oil and gas fields  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered 
long lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
if the carrying amounts of the long lived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates  the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded 
the amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows 
in the case of oil and gas fields  the present value of future net cash flows is based on management s best estimate of future prices  which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices  applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk adjusted rate 
the projected production volumes represent reserves  including probable reserves  expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures 
the production volumes  prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information 
oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows  since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices 
the corporation s impairment tests of long lived e p producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes including recovery factors  selling prices  operating and capital costs  the timing of future production and other factors  which are updated each time an impairment test is performed 
the corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease  crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly 
the corporation s goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level  which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
the impairment test is conducted annually in the fourth quarter or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable 
the reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed 
the corporation s goodwill is assigned to the e p operating segment and it expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operation of that segment 
the corporation s fair value estimate of the e p segment is the sum of the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments  the estimated risk adjusted present value of exploration assets  and an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential 
table of contents synergies including cost savings  access to new business opportunities  enterprise control  improved processes and increased market share 
the corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar exploration and production companies 
the determination of the fair value of the e p segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves  future prices  timing of future net cash flows and market premiums 
significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the e p segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill 
as there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing  there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the e p segment 
impairment of equity investees the corporation reviews equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary decline in value may have occurred 
the fair value measurement used in the impairment assessment is based on quoted market prices  where available  or other valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows 
differences between the carrying value of the corporation s equity investments and its equity in the net assets of the affiliate that result from impairment charges are amortized over the remaining useful life of the affiliate s fixed assets 
income taxes judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
these judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not  that based on the technical merits  the position will be sustained upon examination 
the corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in several jurisdictions  including the united states  and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits 
additionally  the corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities 
regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized 
if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized 
in evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets  the corporation refers to the reversal periods for available carryforward periods for net operating losses and credit carryforwards  temporary differences  the availability of tax planning strategies  the existence of appreciated assets and estimates of future taxable income and other factors 
estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the corporation s internal business forecasts 
additionally  the corporation has income taxes which have been deferred on intercompany transactions eliminated in consolidation related to transfers of property  plant and equipment remaining within the consolidated group 
the amortization of these income taxes deferred on intercompany transactions will occur ratably with the recovery through depletion and depreciation of the carrying value of these assets 
the corporation does not provide for deferred us income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations 
fair value measurements the corporation s derivative instruments and supplemental pension plan investments are recorded at fair value  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period as appropriate 
the corporation uses various valuation approaches in determining fair value  including the market and income approaches 
the corporation s fair value measurements also include non performance risk and time value of money considerations 
counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances  and the corporation s credit is considered for accrued liabilities 
the corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles 
these fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations  the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of long lived assets  equity method investments or goodwill 
the corporation determines fair value in accordance with the fasb fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure the fair value of financial asset and liabilities based on the source of the input  which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal 
table of contents trading market level to estimates determined using related market data level 
multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value  however  the level of fair value is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy 
details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows fair value measurements based on level inputs measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded 
closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value 
market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity 
the fair value of certain of the corporation s exchange traded futures and options are considered level fair value measurements based on level inputs measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level measurements based on level inputs include over the counter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts 
the corporation utilizes fair value measurements based on level inputs for certain forwards  swaps and options 
the liability related to the corporation s crude oil hedges is classified as level fair value measurements based on level inputs measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations 
for example  in its energy marketing business  the corporation sells natural gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts 
the fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid delivered locations  which are classified as level fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as level derivatives the corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both risk management and trading activities 
in risk management activities  the corporation uses futures  forwards  options and swaps  individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil  natural gas  refined products and electricity  as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates 
in trading activities  the corporation  principally through a consolidated partnership  trades energy commodities and derivatives  including futures  forwards  options and swaps  based on expectations of future market conditions 
all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the corporation s balance sheet 
the corporation s policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative 
the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings 
derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or hedges of firm commitments fair value hedges 
the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings 
changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings 
the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings 
derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an on going basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting 
the prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models  which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices 
retirement plans the corporation has funded non contributory defined benefit pension plans and an unfunded supplemental pension plan 
the corporation recognizes on the balance sheet the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans 

table of contents the determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions  the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations  expected long term rates of return on plan assets  and rate of future increases in compensation levels 
these assumptions represent estimates made by the corporation  some of which can be affected by external factors 
for example  the discount rate used to estimate the corporation s projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of high quality  fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations  while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category  weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category 
changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in the corporation s financial statements 
asset retirement obligations the corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations 
in addition  the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred 
in order to measure these obligations  the corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations 
in determining these estimates  the corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement  timing of settlement  interpretation of legal requirements  inflationary factors and discount rate 
in addition  there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements  fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates  and advances in technology 
as a result  the corporation s estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above 
changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values 
changes in accounting policies effective january   the corporation adopted the amended accounting standards that eliminated the consolidation exception for a qualifying special purpose entity and changed the analysis necessary to determine whether consolidation of a variable interest entity is required 
the adoption of these standards resulted in an increase of approximately million to property  plant and equipment and a corresponding increase to long term debt 
the debt was subsequently repaid during the first quarter of effective december   the fasb adopted accounting standards update asu extractive activities oil and gas asc oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures  which amended the requirements for oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures 
the main provisions of the asu  which align accounting standards with the previously issued securities and exchange commission sec requirements  expand the definition of oil and gas producing activities to include the extraction of resources which are saleable as synthetic oil or gas  to change the price assumption used for reserve estimation and future cash flows to a twelve month average from the year end price and to amend the geographic disclosure requirements for reporting reserves and other supplementary oil and gas data

the corporation and hovensa produce and the corporation distributes fuel oils in the united states 
many states and localities are adopting requirements that mandate a lower sulfur content of fuel oils and restrict the types of fuel oil sold within their jurisdictions 
these proposals could require capital expenditures by the corporation and hovensa to meet the required sulfur content standards or other changes in the marketing of fuel oils 
over the last several years  many refiners have entered into consent agreements to resolve the united states environmental protection agency s epa assertions that refining facilities were modified or expanded without complying with new source review regulations that require permits and new emission controls in certain circumstances and other regulations that impose emissions control requirements 
these consent agreements  which arise out of an epa enforcement initiative focusing on petroleum refiners and utilities  have typically imposed substantial civil fines and penalties and required i significant capital expenditures to install emissions control equipment over a three to eight year time period and ii changes to operations which resulted in increased operating costs 
the capital expenditures  penalties and supplemental environmental projects for individual refineries covered by the settlements can vary significantly  depending on the size and configuration of the refinery  the circumstances of the alleged modifications and whether the refinery has previously installed more advanced pollution controls 
in january  hovensa signed a consent decree with epa to resolve its claims 
under the terms of the consent decree  hovensa will pay a penalty of approximately million and spend approximately million over the next years to install equipment and implement additional operating procedures at the hovensa refinery to reduce emissions 
in addition  the consent decree requires hovensa to spend approximately million to fund an environmental project to be determined at a later date by the virgin islands and  to assist the virgin islands water and power authority with monitoring
