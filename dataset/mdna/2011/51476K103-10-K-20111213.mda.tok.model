item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview landauer is a leading global provider of technical and analytical services to determine occupational and environmental radiation exposure and is the leading domestic provider of outsourced medical physics services 
for over years  the company has provided complete radiation dosimetry services to hospitals  medical and dental offices  universities  national laboratories  nuclear facilities and other industries in which radiation poses a potential threat to employees 
landauer s services include the manufacture of various types of radiation detection monitors  the distribution and collection of the monitors to and from customers  and the analysis and reporting of exposure findings 
these services are provided to approximately million individuals globally 
in addition to providing analytical services  the company may lease or sell dosimetry detectors and reading equipment to large customers that want to manage their own dosimetry programs  or into smaller international markets in which it is not economical to establish a direct service 
landauer s radiation monitoring business is a mature business and growth in numbers of customers is modest 
in recent years  the company s strategy has been to expand into new international markets  primarily by partnering with existing dosimetry service providers with a prominent local presence 
in addition  the company has been developing new platforms and formats for its osl technology  such as inlight  to gain access to markets where the company previously did not have a significant presence  such as smaller in house and commercial laboratories  nuclear power facilities  tactical military monitoring and hospitals to support monitoring of patient exposure to radiation 
revenue growth in recent years has occurred as a result of entry into new markets through joint ventures and acquisitions  modest unit growth  sale of inlight equipment and badges  and new ancillary services and products 
the company believes pricing in the domestic market has become more competitive and opportunities to obtain regular price increases from its customers may be more limited in the future 
the continued economic downturn and uncertain impact of healthcare reform has resulted in increased pricing pressure with the company healthcare customer base  which is expected to continue into the future 
in november  landauer completed the acquisition of gammadata m tteknik ab gdm  a swedish provider of radon measurement services 
gdm is based near stockholm  sweden and provides measurement services throughout the scandinavian region and europe

landauer offers radiation monitoring services in australia  brazil  canada  china  france  japan  mexico  sweden  turkey and the united kingdom 
the company s operations in these markets generally do not depend on significant capital resources 
the company has sufficient cash and cash equivalents available for use in the us to fund current operations without drawing on the permanently reinvested funds held by its foreign operations 
the company is exposed to market risk  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the financial statements of the company s non us subsidiaries are remeasured into non us dollars using the non us dollar as the reporting currency 
the market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rates has historically been immaterial in relation to the company s financial position  results of operations  and cash flows

from time to time  the company may have the opportunity to make investments for acquisitions or other purposes  and borrowings can be made under the current credit facility to fund such investments 
use of non gaap financial measures in evaluating the company s financial performance and outlook  management uses ebitda 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization is a non gaap measure 
management believes that such measure supplements evaluations using operating income  net income  and diluted earnings per share and other gaap measures  and is a useful indicator for investors 
this indicator can help readers gain a meaningful understanding of the company s core operating results and future prospects without the effect of non cash or other one time items and the company s ability to generate cash flows from operations that are available for taxes  capital expenditures  and debt repayment 
investors should recognize that these non gaap measures might not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
these measures should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for or superior to  any measure of performance  cash flows or liquidity prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 

table of contents the following table reconciles net income to ebitda dollars in thousands net income attributed to landauer  inc   add back interest and other expense income income taxes    depreciation and amortization    earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization contractual obligations as of september   the expected resources required for scheduled payment of contractual obligations were as follows schedules payments by fiscal year dollars in thousands total thereafter capital leases operating leases  purchase obligations   dividends   pension and postretirement benefits  revolving credit facility   total obligations     includes accounts payable and other agreements to purchase goods or services including open purchase orders  also includes remaining contractual obligations associated with the company s information systems upgrade

further information regarding the company s income taxes is contained under the footnote income taxes in item of this annual report on form k 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued updated accounting guidance to improve comparability in fair value measurement and disclosure between us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and international financial reporting standards 
the standards update includes changes to the wording used to describe many of the requirements in gaap for measuring fair value and changes to the disclosure of information about fair value measurements 
this guidance is effective for the company in the second quarter of fiscal the company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in june  the fasb issued new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
the guidance  which is intended to increase the prominence of other comprehensive income in financial statements  eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity and instead requires presentation in one continuous statement or two separate but consecutive statements 
this guidance  which must be applied retrospectively  is effective for the company in the first quarter of fiscal the new guidance impacts only the format of financial statement presentation and  therefore upon adoption  will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb approved amended guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity vie 
the guidance requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether a company s variable interest gives it a controlling financial interest in a vie 
a company is required to assess whether it has the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity 
in addition  on going reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie and additional disclosures about an enterprise s involvement in vies are required 
the adoption of this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb approved the issuance of new guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables and arrangements that include software elements 
by providing another alternative for determining the selling price of deliverables  the new guidance allows companies to allocate arrangement consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements in a manner that better reflects the transaction economics and often results in earlier revenue recognition 
in addition  the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration is no longer permitted under the new guidance 
the new guidance for arrangements that include software elements removes non software components of tangible products and certain software components of tangible products from the scope of existing software revenue guidance  resulting in the recognition of revenue similar to that for other tangible products 
the new guidance requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures 
the adoption of this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued amendments to its goodwill impairment guidance 
the amendments provide an option for entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
under these amendments  an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless it determines  based on the qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
the company early adopted the amendments in connection with the performance of its annual goodwill impairment test as of september  inflation the company strives to reflect the inflationary impact of materials  labor and other operating costs and expenses in its prices 
the market for the services and products that the company offers  however  is highly competitive  and in some cases has limited the ability of the company to offset inflationary cost increases

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that management make assumptions and estimates that affect the results of operations and the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements as well as related disclosures 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
below are the critical accounting policies which have been applied in the preparation of the company s financial statements and accompanying notes 
revenue recognition and deferred contract revenue the source of radiation monitoring segment revenues for the company is radiation measuring and monitoring services including other services incidental to measuring and monitoring 
the measuring and monitoring services provided by the company to its customers are of a subscription nature and are continuous 
the company views its business in the radiation monitoring segment as services provided to customers over a period of time and the wear period is the period over which those services are provided 
badge production  wearing of badges  badge analysis  and report preparation are integral to the benefit that the company provides to its customers 
these services are provided to customers on an agreed upon recurring basis monthly  bi monthly  quarterly  semi annually or annually that the customer chooses for the wear period 
revenue is recognized on a straight line basis  adjusted for changes in pricing and volume  over the wear period as the service is continuous and no other discernible pattern of recognition is evident 
revenues are recognized over the periods in which the customers wear the badges irrespective of whether invoiced in advance or in arrears 

table of contents the company  through its medical physics segment  offers full scope medical physics services to hospitals and radiation therapy centers 
services offered include  but are not limited to  clinical physics support in radiation oncology  commissioning services  special projects support and imaging physics services 
delivery of the medical physics services can be of a contracted  recurring nature or as a discrete project with a defined service outcome 
recurring services often are provided on the customer premises by a full time employee or fraction of a full time employee 
these services are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the life of the contract 
fee for service projects revenue is recognized when the service is delivered 
contracted services are billed on an agreed upon recurring basis  either in advance or arrears of the service being delivered 
customers may be billed monthly  quarterly  or at some other regular interval over the contracted period 
the amounts recorded as deferred revenue represent invoiced amounts in advance of delivery of the service 
management believes that the amount of deferred contract revenue fairly represents remaining business activity with customers invoiced in advance 
fee for service revenue is typically associated with much shorter contract periods  or with discrete individual projects 
invoicing is usually done after completion of the project and customer acceptance thereof 
the amounts recorded as deferred contract revenue in the consolidated balance sheets represent invoiced amounts in advance of delivery of the service  and are net of services rendered through the respective consolidated balance sheet date 
such advance billings amounted to million and million  respectively  as of september  and property  plant equipment and other assets maintenance and repairs are charged to expense  and renewals and betterments are capitalized 
plant and equipment and other assets  primarily dosimetry badges  are recorded at cost and are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives  which are primarily years for buildings  three to eight years for equipment  five to eight years for internal software and thirty months to eight years for other assets 
the company assesses the carrying value and the remaining useful lives of its property  plant  equipment  and other assets when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or the estimated useful life may no longer be appropriate 
factors that could trigger this review include competitive conditions  government regulations and technological changes 
the company capitalizes costs of software which is acquired  internally developed  or modified solely to meet the company s internal needs 
in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance  internal and external costs incurred to develop internal use computer software during the application development stage are capitalized 
costs incurred during the preliminary project stage as well as training costs and maintenance costs during the postimplementation operation stage are expensed 
capitalized costs of software amounted to million  million and million  respectively  for fiscal  and in fiscal  all of the capitalized software costs were related to the company s initiative to replace various business processes and replace components of its information technology systems that support customer relationship management and the order to cash cycle 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company s intangible assets include purchased customer lists  licenses  patents  trademarks  tradenames and goodwill 
purchased customer lists are recorded at cost and are amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives  which range from to years 
patents and licenses are also recorded at cost and are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives  which range from to years 
the company acquired goodwill primarily from its acquisitions of landauer europe  sapra landauer and gps as well as other smaller investments 
goodwill as well as trademarks and tradenames have indefinite lives 

table of contents fasb authoritative guidance requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite lives be reviewed periodically for impairment 
reporting units are business components one level below the operating segment level for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by segment management 
per guidance  two or more components of an operating segment should be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics and are economically interdependent  among other factors 
as a result of this aggregation  the company has two reporting units  radiation monitoring and medical physics 
the company performs an impairment test for each of its reporting units with goodwill annually and  for goodwill and other intangible assets that are not being amortized  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
triggering events include  but are not limited to  a current period operating or cash flow loss  a product  technology  or service introduced by a competitor  or a loss of key personnel 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  the company performs a financial analysis of future undiscounted cash flows projections by asset or asset group 
in september  the fasb amended its guidance for testing goodwill for impairment 
under the amended guidance  an entity is permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in the guidance 
the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than percent 
previously  fasb guidance outlined a two step process for determining the impairment of goodwill 
in the first step  the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value is in excess of carrying value  the goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
the testing process is conducted on a disaggregated basis  at the reporting unit level 
the company early adopted the amended guidance at september  landauer first assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units is less than the carrying amounts 
in making its determination  the company considered the following factors  events and circumstances macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  cost factors  overall financial performance  other relevant entity specific events  events affecting a reporting unit  and any sustained decrease in share price 
the company performed the qualitative analysis for each of its individual reporting units  radiation monitoring and medical physics 
as a result of its qualitative analysis  the company determined that it is not likely that the fair value of either the radiation monitoring reporting unit or the medical physics reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  indicating that goodwill is not impaired 
based on amended guidance  the company was not required to calculate the fair value of the reporting units  and no further testing was performed 
to the extent subsequent events arise  market conditions change or the company strategies change  it is possible that the conclusion regarding whether the company goodwill is impaired could change and result in future goodwill impairment charges that will have a material effect on the company consolidated financial position or results of operations 
information regarding the value of goodwill and other intangible assets is presented under the footnote goodwill and other intangible assets in item of this annual report on form k 
income taxes the company estimates the income tax provision for income taxes that are currently payable  and records deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences in tax consequences between the financial statements and tax returns 
temporary differences result from  among other events  revenues  expenses  gains  or losses that are included in taxable income of an earlier or later year than the year in which they are recognized in financial income 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
to the extent that deferred tax assets will not likely be recovered from future taxable income  a valuation allowance is established against such deferred tax assets 

table of contents management exercises significant judgment in the valuation of its current and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the company recognizes the financial statement effects of its tax positions in its current and deferred tax assets and liabilities when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority 
management considers  among other factors  the company s current and past performance  the market environment in which the company operates  and tax planning strategies 
further  the company provides for income tax issues not yet resolved with federal  state and local tax authorities 
the company assesses and updates its tax positions when significant changes in circumstances  which would cause a change in judgment about the likelihood of realizing the deferred items  occur 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
further information regarding the company s income taxes is contained under the footnote income taxes in item of this annual report on form k 
defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans the pension expenses and benefit obligations recorded for the company s defined benefit plans are dependent on actuarial assumptions 
these assumptions include discount rates  expected return on plan assets  interest costs  expected compensation increases  benefits earned  mortality rates  and other factors 
management reviews the plan assumptions on an annual basis to ensure that the most current  relevant information is considered 
if actual results vary considerably from those that are expected or if future changes are made to these assumptions  the amounts recognized for these plans could change significantly 
the weighted average assumed discount rates used to determine plan expenses were for both pension and other benefits in fiscal and for both pension and other benefits in fiscal for fiscal expense  the long term rate of return of plan assets was  unchanged from fiscal in establishing the rate  management considered the historical rates of return and the current and planned asset classes of the plan investment portfolio 
the weighted average discount rate used to determine benefit obligations at september  was compared to the september  rate of  adjusted to reflect the single rate that  when applied to the projected benefit disbursements from the plan  would result in the same discounted value as the array of rates that make up the citigroup pension discount curve as of september the rate of compensation increase was not relevant to the plans in fiscal and due to the plan freeze which occurred in fiscal the company recognizes on its balance sheet the amount by which the projected benefit obligations of its defined benefit plans exceed the fair value of plan assets 
subsequent changes in the funded status of the plans as a result of future transactions and events  amortization of previously unrecognized costs  and changes to actuarial assumptions are recognized as an asset or a liability and amortized as components of net periodic pension cost or accumulated other comprehensive income 
an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside of management s control could have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
information regarding these plans is contained under the footnote employee benefit plans in item of this annual report on form k 

table of contents stock based compensation the company measures and recognizes compensation cost at fair value for all stock based awards  net of the estimated impact of forfeited awards 
the company granted stock options in years prior to fiscal the fair values of options were estimated using a black scholes option pricing model 
in addition to stock options  key employees and or non employee directors are eligible to receive performance shares and restricted stock 
the fair value of performance shares and restricted stock granted under the company s long term incentive plan was based on the average of the company s high and low stock prices on the date of grant 
upon the adoption of the company s incentive compensation plan in february  the fair value of performance shares and restricted stock granted under the new plan is based on the company s closing stock price on the grant date 
the terms of performance share awards allow the recipients of such awards to earn a variable number of shares based on the achievement of the performance goals specified in the awards 
stock based compensation expense associated with performance share awards is recognized based on management s best estimates of the achievement of the performance goals specified in such awards and the resulting number of shares that are expected to be earned 
the company evaluates on a quarterly basis the progress towards achieving the performance criteria 
the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated number of performance share awards expected to be earned is recognized as compensation cost or as a reduction of cost in the period of the revised estimate 
compensation expense for restricted stock is recognized ratably over the vesting period 
forfeitures of awards are estimated at the time of grant and stock based compensation cost is recognized only for those awards expected to vest 
the company uses historical experience to estimate projected forfeitures 
the company recognizes the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the forfeiture rate  or actual forfeitures  as compensation cost or as a reduction of cost in the period of the revision 
if revisions are made to management s assumptions and estimates or if actual results vary considerably from those that are expected  stock based compensation expense could change significantly  impacting the company s results of operations or financial condition 
further information regarding the company s stock based awards is presented under the footnote stock based compensation in item of this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the financial statements of the company s international subsidiaries are remeasured into us dollars using the us dollar as the reporting currency 
to date  the market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rates has not been material in relation to the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
these risks could increase  however  as the company expands in international markets and markets becomes more volatile 
the company estimates that a and adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would have decreased reported net income in fiscal by approximately and  respectively 
historically  the company believes that adverse changes in foreign exchange rates have not materially impacted its financial condition
