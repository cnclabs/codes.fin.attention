item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations overview icad is an industry leading provider of advanced image analysis and workflow solutions that enable radiologists and other healthcare professionals to better serve patients by identifying pathologies and pinpointing cancer earlier 
icad offers a comprehensive range of high performance  expandable computer aided detection cad systems and workflow solutions for mammography film based  digital radiography dr and computed radiography cr  magnetic resonance imaging mri  and computed tomography ct 
icad s solutions aid in the early detection of the most prevalent cancers including breast  prostate and colon cancer 
early detection of cancer is the key to better prognosis  less invasive and lower treatment costs  and higher survival rates 
performed as an adjunct to mammography screening  cad has quickly become the standard of care in breast cancer detection  helping radiologists improve clinical outcomes while enhancing workflow 
computer enhanced breast and prostate mri analysis streamlines case interpretation workflow and generates more robust information for more effective patient treatment 
cad for mammography screening is also reimbursable in the us under federal and most third party insurance programs 
since receiving approval from the fda for the company s first breast cancer detection product in january  over  of icad s cad systems have been placed in mammography practices worldwide 
icad is the only stand alone company offering cad solutions for the early detection of breast cancer 
icad s cad mammography products have been shown to detect up to of the cancers that biopsy proved were missed on the previous mammogram  an average of months earlier 
our advanced pattern recognition technology analyzes images to identify patterns and then uses sophisticated mathematical analysis to mark suspicious areas 
the company s cad systems include proprietary algorithm and other technology together with standard computer and display equipment 
cad systems for the film based analog mammography market also include a radiographic film digitizer  either manufactured by the company or others for the digitization of film based medical images 
the company intends to apply its core competencies in pattern recognition and algorithm development in disease detection to its future product development efforts 
its focus is on the development and marketing of cancer detection products for disease states where there are established or emerging protocols for screening as a standard of care 
icad expects to pursue development or acquisition of products for select disease states that demonstrate one or more of the following it is clinically proven that screening has a significant positive impact on patient outcomes  where there is an opportunity to lower health care costs  where screening is non invasive or minimally invasive and where public awareness is high 
the company also intends to pursue opportunities beyond cad through possible strategic acquisitions as part of its growth strategy  as such the company continues to actively evaluate strategic opportunities in the oncology market that could leverage its opportunities for growth beyond its historic core markets 
icad has applied its patented detection technology and algorithms to the development of cad solutions for use with virtual colonoscopy or ct colonography ctc to improve the detection of colonic polyps 
the company s pattern recognition and image analysis expertise are readily applicable to colonic polyp detection and the company has developed a ctc cad solution 
virtual colonoscopy ctc is a technology that has evolved rapidly in recent years 
based on the results of the national ct colonography trial  the company expects that the market for virtual colonoscopy will grow along with the procedures for early detection of colon cancer 
this trial demonstrated that ctc is highly accurate for the detection of intermediate and large polyps and that the accuracy of ctc is similar to a colonoscopy 
ct colonography or ctc is emerging as an alternative imaging procedure for evaluation of the colon 
the company has developed and commenced marketing veralook  a product for computer aided detection of polyps in the colon using ctc and completed the clinical testing of its ctc cad product in the first quarter of the company filed a k application with the fda in may seeking fda clearance to market veralook in the u 
s and received fda clearance on august  colorectal cancer has been shown to be highly preventable with early detection and removal of polyps 
in july  the company acquired pharmaco kinetic based cad products that aid in the interpretation of contrast enhanced mri images of the breast and prostate and began marketing these products in the fourth quarter of the interpretation of mri exams also benefits from advanced image analysis and clinical decision support tools 
mri is an excellent tool to detect breast cancer as well as prostate cancer 
while mri is a more expensive option than traditional mammography  it enables physicians to view tumors which may have been missed during routine screenings 
mri uses magnets and radio waves instead of x rays to produce very detailed  cross sectional images of the body  and can be used to look specifically at those areas 
the acquisition of xoft  on december   brings an isotope free cancer treatment platform technology to the company s product line 
xoft designs  develops  manufactures  markets and sells electronic brachytherapy ebx products for the treatment of breast and other cancers  used in a broad range of clinical settings 
the portable axxent system which delivers electronically controlled radiation therapy directly to cancer sites with minimal radiation exposure to surrounding healthy tissue is fda cleared 
electronic brachytherapy ebx is a type of brachytherapy that utilizes a miniaturized high dose rate x ray source to apply radiation directly to the cancerous site 
the goal is to direct the radiation dose to the size and shape of the cancerous area  sparing healthy tissue and organs 
the xoft technology de livers similar clinical dose rates to traditional radio active systems 
electronic brachytherapy can be delivered during an operative procedure and may be used as a primary or secondary modality over a course of days 
this technology enables radiation oncology departments in hospitals  clinics and physician offices to perform traditional radiotherapy treatments and offer advanced treatments such as intra operative radiation therapy iort 
current customers for the xoft ebx system include university research and community hospitals  private and governmental institutions  doctors offices and cancer care clinics 
the company s headquarters are located in nashua  new hampshire  with manufacturing and contract manufacturing facilities in new hampshire and massachusetts  a research and development facility in ohio and  with its acquisition of xoft  an operation  research  development  manufacturing and warehousing facility in sunnyvale  california 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows are based on its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates these estimates  including those related to accounts receivable allowance  inventory valuation and obsolescence  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  contingencies and litigation 
additionally  the company uses assumptions and estimates in calculations to determine stock based compensa tion 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory  valuation of long lived and intangible assets  goodwill  stock based compensation  income taxes 
revenue recognition in general the company recognizes revenue when the product ships provided title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are fixed and determinable  collectability is probable and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
the acquisition of xoft had no impact on the company s revenue results for any period presented 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of its digital and film based cad products and services in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  revenue recognition asc  inclusive of asc s  which includes the guidance of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 topic  revenue recognition in financial statements 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of certain of its mri cad products and services in accordance with fasb asc  software  revenue recognition asc 
the company s revenue transactions can  on occasion  include product sales with multiple element arrangements  generally for installation and training 
on those occasions  the company follows the requirements in fasb asc topic multiple element arrangements asc 
for most of icad s product sales the responsibility for the installation process lies with its oem partners  ge healthcare  siemens medical and others 
when icad is responsible for product installation  the installation element is considered a separate unit of accounting because the delivered product has stand alone value to the customer and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered installation element 
the in stallation and training revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
fair value of the installation and training is determined using entity specific and third party evidence 
the company generally recognizes revenue upon shipment of product to customers and the fulfillment of all contractual terms and conditions 
the company uses customer purchase orders that include all terms of the arrangement and in the case of oem customers are also supported by distribution agreements 
the company generally ships free on board shipping point and uses shipping documents and third party proof of delivery to verify delivery and transfer of title 
in addition  the company assesses whether collection is reasonably assured by considering a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer  as obtained from third party credit references 
if the terms of the sale include customer acceptance provisions and compliance with those provisions cannot be demonstrated  all revenues are deferred and not recognized until such acceptance occurs 
the company considers all relevant facts and circumstances in determining when to recognize revenue  including contractual obligations to the customer  the customer s post delivery acceptance provisions  if any  and the installation process 
there are no significant estimates or assumptions used in the company s revenue recognition 
the company defers revenue from the sale of extended service contracts related to future periods and recognizes revenue on a straight line basis in accordance with fasb asc topic  services 
the company provides for estimated warranty costs on original product warranties at the time of sale 
the company believes that revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because it is governed by multiple complex accounting rules and it is important for readers of its financial statements to understand the basis upon which its revenues are recorded 
in addition  the company believes that its investors value the company and track its progress based to a large extent upon revenues 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s policy is to maintain allowances for estimated losses from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial results  stability and payment history of each customer 
where appropriate  the company obtains credit rating reports and financial statements of customers when determining or modifying credit limits 
the company s senior management reviews accounts receivable on a periodic basis to determine if any receivables may potentially be uncollectible 
the company includes any accounts receivable balances that it determines may likely be uncollectible  along with a general reserve for estimated probable losses based on historical experience  in its overall allowance for doubtful account s 
an amount would be written off against the allowance after all attempts to collect the receivable had failed 
based on the information available to the company  it believes the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  is adequate 
inventory inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value  with cost determined by the first in  first out method 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and or obsolete inventory primarily based upon estimated usage of its inventory as well as other factors 
long lived assets long lived assets  other than goodwill  are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of these assets 
when any such impairment exists  the related assets are written down to fair value 
intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of patents  technology intangibles  trade name  customer relationships and distribution agreements purchased in the company s previous acquisitions 
these assets  which include assets acquired from xoft  inc  are amortized on a straight line basis or the pattern of economic benefit over their estimated useful lives of to years 
goodwill the company follows the provision of fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc 
asc requires companies to use the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations initiated after june   and establishes specific criteria for the recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized and are tested for impairment at least annually 
in accordance with asc  the company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of the company is less than its carrying value 
the company s goodwill arose in connection with the acquisition of issi in june  with the acquisition of cadx in december and with the acquisition of xoft in december the company continues to operate in one segment and as one reporting unit since operations will continue to be supported by one central staff and the results of operations will be evaluated as one business unit 
therefore  the company uses market capitalization as the best evidence of fair value market capitalization is calculated using the quoted closing share price of the company s common stock at its annual impairment date of october  multiplied by the number of common shares outstanding of the company 
the company tests goodwill for impairment by comparing its market capitalization fair value and addin g a reasonable control premium to its carrying value 
the fair value of the company is compared to the carrying amount at the same date as the basis to determine if an impairment exists 
no goodwill impairment loss was recorded in  or for and  the company performed the step one fair value comparison as of october  and october  at both dates the company s market capitalization exceeded its carrying value 
at december  and  the company s market capitalization exceeded its carrying value 
the company reviews fair value and goodwill impairment on a quarterly basis and between annual tests if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of the company is less than its carrying value 
events that would indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment include  but are not limited to  current economic and market conditions  changes in its results of operations and changes in its forecasts or market expectation relating to future results 
the company will continue to monitor its goodwill for impairment 
stock based compensation the company maintains stock based incentive plans  under which it provides stock incentives to employees  directors and contractors 
the company grants to employees  directors and contractors  restricted stock and or options to purchase common stock at an option price equal to the market value of the stock at the date of grant 
the company follows fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation  asc  for all stock based compensation that was not vested as of january  the company adopted asc using a modified prospective application  as permitted under asc the company used the black scholes option pricing model which requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates  including estimates of the expected term participants will retain their vested stock options before exercising them  the estimated volatility of its common stock price over the expected term  and the number of options that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements 
application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of the fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
the provisions apply to new stock options and stock options outstanding  but not yet vested  on the date of the company adoption 
stock based compensation expense was included in applicable departmental expense categories in the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal  and periods 
income taxes the company follows the liability method under fasb asc topic  income taxes asc 
the primary objectives of accounting for taxes under asc are to a recognize the amount of tax payable for the current year and b recognize the amount of deferred tax liability or asset for the future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
the company has provided a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets at december  and as it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
asc clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
asc also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  disclosure and transition 
in addition  uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date and the company revaluates these items quarterly  with any adjustments to preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill  provided that the company is within the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date and continues to collect information in order to determine their estimated values 
subsequent to the measurement period or final determination of the tax allowance s or contingency s estimated value  changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances may affect the provision for income taxes presented in the company s statement of operations 
the company does not anticipate any material changes in uncertain tax positions that could have a material impact on the results of operation and financial position as a result of its acquisition of xoft  inc year ended december  compared to year ended december  the consolidated statement of operations does not include the financial results of xoft for any period presented
