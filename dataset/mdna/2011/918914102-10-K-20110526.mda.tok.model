item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general we develop  manufacture and sell advanced energy storage systems utilizing our proprietary phosphate based lithium ion technology for diverse applications  with special emphasis on hybrid and electric fleet vehicles  portable appliances  and other industry and consumer applications 
our mission is to promote the wide adoption of high performance  safe  environmentally friendly energy storage systems 
to accomplish our mission and address the significant market opportunity we believe is available  we utilize the numerous benefits of our latest energy storage technology  worldwide intellectual property portfolio and extensive experience of our management team 
total revenue in fiscal year was million  an increase of compared to the prior fiscal year 
we believe revenue will grow in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  from existing and new customer sales due to the increasing demand in the us and emea europe  middle east and africa markets for alternative energy solution systems 
going concern as a result of our limited cash resources and history of operating losses there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we presently have no further commitments for financing by our chairman carl berg and or his affiliates 
recently  we have depended on sales of our common stock under the at market issuance agreement with wm 
smith co  and to a lesser extent sales of our common stock under the common stock purchase agreement with seaside  lp our agreement with seaside expired in october if we are unable to obtain financing from mr 
berg  wm 
smith co  or others on terms acceptable to us  or at all  we may be forced to cease all operations and liquidate our assets 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of changes in our operations  including the failure to achieve expected revenues  greater than expected expenses  changes in oem relationships  market conditions  the failure to timely realize our product development goals  and other adverse developments 
these events could have a negative effect on our available liquidity sources during fiscal year highlights key financial and product introductions and milestones based on our lithium iron magnesium phosphate technology during fiscal year include we set a revenue record of million in fiscal year  which is a improvement over fiscal year we introduced the volt scalable u charge system we introduced a custom energy storage system for the next generation london double deck hybrid bus we prevailed in a lawsuit regarding the patent infringement of the carbothermal reduction process used in our cathode material manufacturing we were awarded new patents in the us and worldwide patents during the fiscal year continuing development of valence lithium phosphate technology systems in  we successfully produced our first generation lithium iron magnesium phosphate material in  we introduced our lithium iron magnesium phosphate material in a cylindrical construction  and we launched our segway custom pack product 
in  we increased the capacity of our energy cell which was included in our volt u charge scalable modules in  we launched our volt u charge scalable modules in  we launched our volt u charge scalable modules in  we plan to launch several next generation high power custom systems our research and development efforts are focused on the design of new products utilizing our lithium iron magnesium phosphate chemistry  the continuous improvement of the manufacturing process of our second and third generation lithium phosphate technology  the development of different cell constructions to optimize power and size for new applications  as well as developing future materials based on our lithium ion phosphate technology platform 
our business headquarters is in austin  texas 
our materials research and development center is in las vegas  nevada 
our european sales and oem manufacturing support center is in mallusk  northern ireland

result of operations fiscal years ended march  fiscal year  march  fiscal year and march  fiscal year the following table summarizes the results of our operations for the past three fiscal years in thousands except for share data fiscal year ended change increase decrease change increase decrease revenue cost of products sold gross margin operating and other expenses loss on disposal of assets impairments  restructuring  contract settlement charges total operating expenses operating loss other expense  net net loss dividends and accretion on preferred stock net loss available to common stockholders net loss per share available to common stockholders  basic and diluted shares used in computing net loss per share available to common stockholders  basic and diluted revenue and gross margin revenue 
revenue totaled million for the fiscal year ended march   a million  or a increase  compared to million in revenue for the fiscal year ended march  revenue for fiscal year was million  which was a decrease of million  or a decrease  compared to million in revenue for the fiscal year ended march  the increase in revenue during fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  is primarily the result of increased sales to smith electric vehicles  and segway inc segway 
smith electric vehicles and segway sales in fiscal year were million and million  respectively  as compared to million and million  respectively  in fiscal year the decrease in revenue during fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  was primarily the result of decreased sales to segway and smith electric vehicles 
revenue for segway and smith electric vehciles were million and million  respectively  in fiscal year  compared to million and million  respectively  in fiscal year smith electric vehicles sales accounted for   and of our total revenue in fiscal years   and  respectively 
segway sales accounted for   and of our total product sales in fiscal years   and  respectively 
large format battery system sales represented   and  of our total revenue for fiscal years   and  respectively 
we expect sales of our large format battery system to increase during fiscal year  due to the growing demand of alternative energy storage systems and the fulfillment of current sales agreements 
we believe the increase in demand in alternative energy solutions is being driven largely by the sustained high cost of fossil fuels and a market focus on environmentally friendly energy solutions 
we expect sales of our large format battery systems and custom packs to increase during the upcoming fiscal year due to anticipated continued strong demand for our products from a variety of customers 
we did not experience any material effect of inflation on our revenues in the three most recent fiscal years 
gross margin gross margin for the fiscal year ended march  was million  compared to million for fiscal year  and million for fiscal year gross margin as a percentage of revenue was for the fiscal year ended march   compared to for the fiscal year ended march   and for the fiscal year ended march  during fiscal year  gross margin in dollars and as a percentage of revenue increased mainly due to improved manufacturing efficiencies and to the increased absorption of fixed overhead associated with our production facility in china and reduced raw material costs 
during fiscal year  gross margin in dollars and as a percentage of revenue increased mainly due to improved manufacturing efficiencies despite the decrease in overall demand  and the absence of significant material obsolescence charges for discontinued product lines  such as epoch and n charge  which occurred in fiscal year we expect cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  to remain relatively consistent in fiscal year we did not experience any material effect of inflation on our gross margin or operating expense in the three most recent fiscal years 
operating expenses the following table summarizes our operating expenses during each of the past three fiscal years in thousands fiscal year ended change increase decrease change increase decrease operating expenses research and product development sales and marketing general and administrative loss gain on disposal of assets asset impairment charge total operating expenses total operating expenses as a percent total revenue operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to in fiscal year  versus in fiscal year  and in fiscal year the dollar decrease in operating expenses in fiscal year is mainly due to reductions in research and development expense and general and administrative expenses  and the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue is due to higher recorded revenue in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year similarly  the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  is due to the reduced revenue recorded in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year research and product development research and product development expenses consist primarily of personnel  equipment  and materials to support our efforts to develop battery chemistry and products  as well as to improve our manufacturing processes 
research and product development expenses totaled million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year during fiscal year  research and development decreased by million  or  compared to fiscal year the decrease in research and development expenses in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  was primarily due to decreased wage and salary expenses  and reduced share based compensation expenses in fiscal year during fiscal year  research and development remained relatively flat compared to fiscal year during fiscal year  million of share based compensation was allocated to research and development expenses  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year we expect research and development expenses to remain relatively steady as we create and develop new products during fiscal year sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs related to sales and marketing personnel  public relations and promotional materials 
sales and marketing expenses totaled million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year during fiscal year   and sales and marketing expenses remained relatively flat 
during fiscal year  million of share based compensation was allocated to marketing expenses  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year we expect sales and marketing expenses could increase moderately as we focus on growing our revenue during fiscal year general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wage and salary expenses  share based compensation expense  and other related costs for finance  human resources  facilities  information technology  legal  audit  insurance and corporate related expenses 
general and administrative expenses totaled million during fiscal year  million during fiscal year  and million in fiscal year general and administrative expenses decreased during fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  primarily as a result of reduced share based compensation expense in fiscal year  and a reduction in compensation related expenses as the result of the release of a liability for accrued foreign employment taxes related to our ireland operations 
general and administrative expenses increased million in fiscal year  or  compared to fiscal year primarily due to a million increase in legal costs associated with the defense of our intellectual property  and a million increase in share based compensation expenses from the granting of stock option awards to directors and executives in fiscal year in addition  wages and salaries increased million in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  as a result of the addition of several finance and executive level personnel in fiscal year share based compensation expense was million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in line with our associated needs as we grow 
we also expect litigation expenses to increase as the litigation matters continue and advance to trial 
impairment charge impairment charges of approximately million  million  and million were recorded during fiscal years  and  respectively 
the fiscal year and impairment charges related to fixed assets that were purchased for the expansion of our production facilities in china 
these production assets were deemed to be impaired since the additional capacity provided by the acquisition of these assets was determined not to be necessary to meet expected demand until later than initially expected 
the fiscal year impairment charge was the result of our annual fixed asset inventory count and audit for idle or damaged assets in our china production facility 
loss on sale of assets loss on sales of assets amounted to approximately million in fiscal year and resulted primarily from consolidating our china operations into two plants in suzhou  china  and the resulting sale of related equipment that was not required in our manufacturing and development operations in suzhou  china 
interest expense and other expense interest expense interest expense relates to our long term debt with a stockholder and a third party creditor 
interest expense was million  million  and million for the fiscal years   and  respectively 
interest expense fluctuations are a result of changes in the underlying interest rate on one of the loans  which is indexed to the libor rate 
casualty loss property and casualty loss 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  we experienced a fire at an offsite warehouse in suzhou  china  which contained certain fixed assets and inventory 
based upon our initial estimates of the casualty loss and expected insurance recoveries from this incident we recorded a casualty loss of million in the quarter ended september   a receivable for the expected insurance recoveries of million  a reduction of inventory and fixed assets of approximately million  and related accrued liabilities for vat taxes and expected clean up costs of approximately million 
we settled a claim with our insurance carrier during the fourth quarter of fiscal year for million related to this fire  and recorded a million reduction of the casualty loss previously recorded 
liquidity and capital resources at march   our principal source of liquidity was cash and cash equivalents of million 
we do not expect our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital needs for the next twelve months following march   nor do we anticipate that product sales during fiscal year will be sufficient to cover our operating expenses 
historically  we have relied upon management s ability to periodically arrange for additional equity or debt financing to meet our liquidity requirements 
unless our product sales are greater than management currently forecasts or there are other changes to our business plan  we will need to arrange for additional financing to fund operating and capital needs 
this financing could take the form of debt or equity 
given our historical operating results and the amount of our existing debt  as well as the other factors  we may not be able to arrange for debt or equity financing on favorable terms or at all 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of changes in our operations  including our failure to achieve expected revenues  changes in oem relationships  market conditions  the failure to timely realize our product development goals  our stock price  and other adverse developments 
these events could have a negative effect on our available liquidity sources during the next twelve months 
the following table summarizes our statement of cash flows for the fiscal years ended march    and in thousands fiscal year ended march  net cash flows provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of foreign exchange rates net decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash used by operating activities during fiscal years and was million  and million  respectively 
the cash used for operating activities during both fiscal years was primarily for operating losses and working capital requirements 
cash used by operations increased during fiscal year due to a million increase in cash used in our accounts receivable and a million increase in cash used in our inventory 
the increased use of cash for our accounts receivable and inventory in fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  was due to our increased sales and inventory production necessary to support the increased demand of our customers 
cash used for operating activities in fiscal year was higher than in fiscal year primarily due to increased sales activity in the current period  which required additional capital to support increased inventory levels and production salaries 
cash used by investing activities during fiscal years and was million and million  respectively 
the cash used by investing activities in both years was primarily for the acquisition of capital equipment for our china facilities 
we obtained net cash from financing activities of million and million during fiscal years and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year consisted of million of common stock sold under the common stock purchase agreement with seaside  million in sales of our common stock to carl berg  which consisted of cash payments and the settlements of certain promissory notes  as discussed in more detail below in note to notes to the consolidated financial statements  and million of common stock sold under our at market issuance sales agreement with wm 
smith co 
in addition  we made payments on our short term debt to a third party financing company totaling million in fiscal year net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year includes million of common stock sold under the common stock purchase agreement with seaside  million in sales of our common stock to carl berg  million of common stock sold under our at market issuance sales agreement with wm 
smith co  and million received from the exercise of stock options by employees 
we filed a form s registration statement with the sec utilizing a shelf registration process  and such registration statement was declared effective on january  the new registration statement 
under this registration statement  we may sell debt or equity securities described in the accompanying prospectus in one or more offerings up to a total public offering price of million 
the new registration statement replaced our form s registration statement  which was declared effective on january  that expired on january  the expired registration statement 
we believe that the new registration statement provides us additional flexibility with regard to potential financings that we may undertake when market conditions permit or that our financial condition may require 
the shares sold to seaside and the shares sold under the wm 
smith agreement before the new registration statement became effective were registered under the expired registration statement  and the shares which may be sold under the wm 
smith agreement on or after the new registration statement became effective are registered under the new registration statement 
on october   we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with seaside lp  which provides that  upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein  we are required to issue and sell  and seaside to purchase  up to  shares of our common stock once every two weeks  subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions  beginning on october  and ending on or about the date that is weeks subsequent to the initial closing  for an aggregate sale to seaside of up to  shares of common stock

to the at market issuance sales agreement amendment no 
 with the sales agent  which provides  among other things  that the number of shares of our common stock which may be issued and sold through the sales agent increased from  shares to  shares 
on january   we entered into an amendment no 
to at market issuance sales agreement amendment no 
with the sales agent 
amendment no 
provided  among other things  that the shares of our common stock that remain available to be sold under the at market issuance sales agreement as of the amendment date will be registered under the new registration statement 
through march   we had sold million shares with gross proceeds of million under the amended at market issuance sales agreement 
as of the date of this report  we have made no further decisions as to whether or when we may seek to make additional sales under the at market issuance sales agreement 
at march   the redemption obligation for our series c convertible preferred stock and series c convertible preferred stock  all of which is currently held by berg berg  is million  plus accrued dividends  which as of march  totaled approximately million 
the preferred shares are currently subject to redemption or conversion at the holder s discretion 
we do not have sufficient resources to effect this redemption  however  berg berg has agreed that our failure to redeem the series c convertible preferred stock and the series c convertible preferred stock does not constitute a default under the certificate of designations for either the series c convertible preferred stock or the series c convertible preferred stock and has waived the accrual of any default interest applicable 
berg berg also has agreed to defer the payment of dividends on the series c convertible preferred stock and series c convertible preferred stock 
according to our agreement with berg berg  dividends will continue to accrue without interest on the series c convertible preferred stock and the series c convertible preferred stock according to the terms of the applicable certificates of designation  and such dividends are not payable until such time as the parties mutually agree  or upon redemption or conversion in accordance with the terms of the applicable certificates of designation 
we have no present intention to pay dividends on this preferred stock  including the accrued dividends 
the series c convertible preferred stock may be converted  at any time  into shares of our common stock at the lower of or the closing price of our common stock on the conversion date  provided the conversion price can be no lower than  the closing price of the common stock on december  the series c convertible preferred stock may be converted  at any time  into shares of our common stock at the lower of or the closing price of our common stock on the conversion date  provided the conversion price can be no lower than  the closing bid price of our common stock on july  as a result of our limited cash resources and history of operating losses  our auditors have expressed in their report on our consolidated financial statements  included in our audited march  consolidated financial statements  that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of changes in our operations  including the failure to achieve expected revenues  greater than expected expenses  changes in oem relationships  market conditions  the failure to timely realize our product development goals  and other adverse developments 
these events could have a negative effect on our available liquidity sources 
we intend to improve our liquidity by continued monitoring and reduction of manufacturing  facility and administrative costs 
however  there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful or that the anticipated benefits would be realized in the near term 
short term and long term principal and interest repayment obligations at march   our cash obligations for short term and long term debt principal and interest consisted of in thousands march  short term debt current portion of interest on short term debt long term debt to stockholder long term debt to stockholder long term portion of interest on debt total at march   our repayment obligations of short term and long term debt principal are in thousands fiscal year ended march  thereafter total principal repayments we have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness and other obligations 
as of march   we had approximately million of total consolidated indebtedness  including accrued interest 
included in this amount are million of loans outstanding  to an affiliate of carl berg  million of accumulated interest associated with those loans and million of principal and interest outstanding with a third party finance company 
we began making monthly principal payments on the loan to the third party in fiscal year  and the final payment is payable in february the terms of the certificates of designation for the series c convertible preferred stock and the series c convertible preferred stock initially provided that the deadline for redemption was december  pursuant to assignment agreements entered into between the company and berg berg  berg berg waived the requirement that the series c convertible preferred stock and series c convertible preferred stock be redeemed on this date 
there currently are no redemption deadlines 
as set forth above  although dividends are not due  they are continuing to accrue  which was approximately million as of march  if cash flow from operations is not adequate to meet debt obligations  additional debt or equity financing will be required 
there can be no assurance that we could obtain the additional financing

off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
basis of presentation  critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states u 
s 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts 
we believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  inventory reserves  inventory overhead absorption  warranty liabilities  and share based compensation expense 
our accounting policies are described in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements  note  summary of significant accounting policies 
the following further describes the methods and assumptions we use in our critical accounting policies and estimates 
revenue recognition we generate revenues from sales of products including batteries and battery systems  and from licensing fees and royalties under technology license agreements 
product sales are recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  seller s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
for shipments where the transfer of title and risk of loss does not occur until the customer has accepted the product  we rely upon third party shipper notifications and notices of acceptance from the customer to recognize revenue 
for all shipments  we estimate a return rate percentage based upon historical experience 
from time to time we provide sales incentives in the form of rebates or other price adjustments  these are generally recorded as reductions to revenue on the latter of the date the related revenue is recognized or at the time the rebate or sales incentive is offered 
licensing fees are recognized as revenue upon completion of an executed agreement and delivery of licensed information  if there are no significant remaining vendor obligations and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
royalty revenues are recognized upon licensee revenue reporting and when collection is reasonably assured 
impairment of long lived assets we perform a review of long lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate 
if long lived assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value and is recorded in the period the determination was made 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost determined using the first in  first out method or market 
adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value are made  if required  for estimated excess  obsolescence or impaired balances 
warranty we record warranty liabilities at the time of sale for the estimated costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty 
the warranty terms and conditions generally provide for replacement of defective products 
factors that affect the warranty liability calculations include the number of units currently under warranty  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims on those units  and cost per claim to satisfy the warranty obligation 
each quarter  we re evaluate the estimate to assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary 
share based compensation we measure share based compensation expense for all share based awards granted based on the estimated fair value of those awards at grant date 
the fair values of stock option awards are estimated using a black scholes valuation model 
the compensation costs are recognized net of any estimated forfeitures on a straight line basis over the employee requisite service period 
forfeiture rates are estimated at grant date based on historical experience and adjusted in subsequent periods for any differences in actual forfeitures from those estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements on june   the fasb issued asc no 
 consolidation  amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r  which significantly changes the consolidation model for variable interest entities 
asc no 
requires companies to qualitatively assess the determination of the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie based on whether the entity has the power to direct matters that most significantly affect the activities of the vie  and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
the standard shall be effective as of the beginning of each reporting entity s first annual reporting period that begins after november   for interim periods within that first annual reporting period  and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter 
earlier application is prohibited 
we adopted asc no 
on april   and its adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we have implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact our consolidated financial statements and do not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
risk factors see item a of this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
as a result of our foreign operations  we have significant expenses  assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies 
a significant number of our employees are located in asia 
therefore  a substantial portion of our payroll as well as certain other operating expenses are paid in the china rmb 
additionally  we purchase materials and components from suppliers in asia 
while we pay many of these suppliers in us dollars  their costs are typically based upon the local currency of the country in which they operate 
the majority of our revenues are received in us dollars 
as a consequence  our gross profit  operating results  profitability and cash flows are adversely affected when the dollar depreciates relative to other foreign currencies 
we have a particularly significant currency rate exposure to changes in the exchange rate between the rmb and the us dollar 
for example  to the extent that we need to convert us dollars for our operations  appreciation of the rmb against the us dollar would have an adverse effect on the amount we receive from the conversion 
we have not used any forward contracts  currency borrowings or derivative financial instruments for purposes of reducing our exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate sensitivity 
our exposure to interest rate risk primarily relates to a million loan agreement we entered into on july   with istar with an adjustable interest rate equal to the greater of or the sum of the libor rate plus libor was less than at march  
we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the following table presents the principal cash flows by year of maturity for our total debt obligations held at march  in thousands expected maturity date by fiscal year thereafter total fixed rate debt variable rate debt based on borrowing rates currently available to use for loans with similar terms  the carrying value of our debt obligations approximates fair value
