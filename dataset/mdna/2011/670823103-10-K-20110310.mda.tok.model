item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a multi concept restaurant company headquartered in nashville  tennessee 
we own and operate three restaurant concepts under the o charley s  ninety nine and stoney river legendary steaks trade names 
as of december   we operated o charley s company owned restaurants in states in the east  southeast and midwest  ninety nine restaurants in seven states throughout new england and upstate new york  and stoney river restaurants in six states in the east  southeast and midwest 
as of december   we had nine franchised o charley s restaurants in five states in the east  southeast and midwest 
on july   we announced that david w 
head had been named our new president and chief executive officer commencing september  he was also appointed to our board of directors 
prior to joining o charley s and since  mr 
head served as chairman  president and chief executive officer of captain d s seafood kitchen  an operator and franchisor of quick service seafood restaurants 
from to mr 
head served as president  chief executive officer and director of romacorp  inc  which operates and franchises tony roma s casual dining locations 
in addition  effective as of december   our former chief financial officer resigned to accept a position with another company  and r 
jeffrey williams  our chief accounting officer and corporate controller  was appointed to serve as our interim chief financial officer and treasurer and as our principal financial officer  in addition to his other positions with the company 
mr 
williams has served as our chief accounting officer since february and as our corporate controller since february on december   we announced that we closed underperforming o charley s restaurants and five underperforming ninety nine restaurants 
the decision to close the underperforming restaurants was the result of an extensive review of our restaurant portfolio that examined each restaurant s recent and historical financial and operating performance  its position in the marketplace  and other operating considerations 
eight of the closed restaurants were treated as discontinued operations in the company s financial statements 
in addition  we closed one o charley s restaurant and two ninety nine restaurants during the fourth quarter  one of which was treated as discontinued operations 
in total  restaurants were closed during the fourth fiscal quarter  of which nine were treated as discontinued operations 
in response to the macroeconomic conditions of the past several years  much of management s focus has been on improving guest satisfaction  stabilizing and increasing guest counts and sales  controlling margins  reducing overhead costs  maximizing cash flow  and reducing debt 
while we believe that we have made progress in these areas  and that the tools we applied  such as our food  labor  and beverage cost management systems  continue to contribute positively to our operating results  we believe that we still have considerable opportunities to improve our financial performance 
our guest satisfaction index gsi scores have continued to increase in fiscal  which we believe is a barometer signifying our guests intent to return to the restaurant 
the percentage of respondents who gave the highest rating for overall satisfaction improved at all three of our brands during fiscal as compared to the end of the prior fiscal year 
going forward  we believe that our primary focus must be on positioning each of our restaurant concepts to increase guest counts  sales  and profitability 
as discussed below  several initiatives are underway to increase guest frequency and improve the guest experience 
in addition  organizational changes were made during fiscal that are expected to reduce our general and administrative costs going forward 
at our o charley s restaurants  we have conducted market research over the past year to better understand the perceptions of the brand 
based upon this research  we believe that many guests no longer perceive o charley s to have better food and service than our competitors  causing many of them to leave the brand or reduce their frequency of visits 
we also learned that many of our formerly loyal guests have a strong attachment to the brand 
in response  we have a series of initiatives underway to build upon the brand s existing strengths by simplifying the menu and improving the quality of every menu item while actively working with our new advertising agency to evolve from a retail value message to a brand value message 
our turnaround is a multi step process 
first we must provide a compelling value as an incentive for lapsed guests to come back to our restaurants  and new guests to try us for the first time 
we saw some favorable results in through our re introduction of two meals for combined with value priced beverage and appetizer choices  and an opportunity for customers to complete their meal with soup or salad and a dessert for 
in addition  while same stores sales at the o charley s brand did not increase during the year  we saw improved same store sales during the final two fiscal quarters of we also began our re training and re certification program with our restaurant management teams to improve service and execution to convert new and returning guests into loyal o charley s guests 
to support our repositioning efforts  during the latter part of we selected a new advertising agency that we believe will provide creative thinking and a fresh approach to our marketing and advertising efforts 
we expect the turnaround in guest perceptions of o charley s to be gradual 
in the short term  we plan to drive sales by continuing to focus on value with attractively priced entr es  appetizers and cocktails  while we introduce new menu items at higher price points with higher margins 
at our ninety nine restaurants  we continue to focus on our core guests  who we believe appreciate a friendly environment that offers generous portions of high quality traditional fare at moderate prices 
our nine real sized entr es for continues to prove popular with our guests  and we plan to continue to refresh the nine menu items over time 
this offering is now featured in the regular menu rather than as a menu insert as previously placed 
this approach is yielding favorable results as same store sales during the final two fiscal quarters of were positive 
at our stoney river restaurants  in order to provide increased brand relevance to our guests  we have reduced prices on certain menu items  added new menu items and added more affordable choices to our wine list while continuing to offer our signature favorite menu items and outstanding guest service 
we completed the roll out of these repositioning elements last year and are now focused on refreshing our menu choices as well as bringing stoney river s cost structure in line with the lower check average 
our guests continue to respond favorably as the fourth fiscal quarter of was our sixth consecutive quarter of improved operating margins 
in addition  subsequent to our fiscal year end we announced the hiring of fred thimm as the concept president for stoney river 
mr 
thimm has extensive experience in the upscale casual and fine dining market  most notably as president and chief operating officer of the palm restaurants

the royalties are recognized as revenue in the period corresponding to the franchisees sales 
cost of food and beverage primarily consists of the costs of beef  poultry  seafood  and alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages net of vendor discounts and rebates 
the three most significant commodities that may affect our cost of food and beverage are beef  poultry  and seafood which accounted for approximately percent  percent and percent  respectively  of our overall cost of food and beverage in fiscal generally  temporary increases in these costs are not passed on to guests  however  in the past  we have adjusted menu prices to compensate for increased costs of a more permanent nature

based on the size of the investment that we make  the economic penalty incurred by discontinuing use of the leased facility  our historical experience with respect to the length of time a restaurant operates at a specific location  and leases that typically have multiple five year renewal options that are exercised entirely at our discretion  we have concluded that one five year renewal option is reasonably assured

the amount of pre opening costs incurred in any one period includes costs incurred during the period for restaurants opened and under development 
our pre opening costs may vary significantly from period to period primarily due to the timing of restaurant development and openings 
pre opening costs were not material in and are not expected to be material in due to curtailment of development activity 
pre opening costs also include training  supply  and other incremental costs necessary to prepare for the re opening of an existing restaurant as part of re branding or re modeling initiatives

when computing same store sales  guest visits and average check per guest  restaurants open for at least weeks are compared from period to period for company owned restaurants 
the average check per guest is computed using all restaurants open during the year 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year overview the comparison between our financial results in and our financial results in was impacted by a number of developments 
we continued to experience declines in same store sales and average weekly sales at each of our concepts due to the economic environment  however same store sales trends improved in the second half of fiscal as compared to the prior year period 
during fiscal  we closed restaurants  of which nine are considered discontinued operations  and incurred impairment  disposal and restructuring charges of million  of which million is included in loss from discontinued operations  net on our consolidated statement of operations 
the following discussion on year over year results pertains only to those locations included in our continuing operations 
revenues during fiscal  total revenues decreased million  or percent  to million from million in in  average check and same store guest visits decreased at o charley s and ninety nine  and average check decreased and same store guest visits increased at stoney river 
we believe these decreases in average check and same store guest visits are due primarily to weak consumer demand caused by the current economic environment 
as consumers became more value conscious  we offered a greater variety of lower priced menu options and discounts 
restaurant sales for o charley s decreased million  or percent  to million during fiscal  reflecting a decline in same store sales of percent and the closure of ten restaurants since the beginning of the fiscal year 
the closure of the ten restaurants reduced sales in the current year by million 
the same store sales decrease of percent was the result of a percent decrease in average check and a percent decrease in guest counts 
the percent decrease in average check reduced sales by million compared to the prior year period  while the percent decrease in guest counts decreased sales by million compared to the prior year period 
restaurant sales for ninety nine decreased million  or percent  to million during fiscal  reflecting a decline in same store sales of percent  and the closing of five restaurants since the beginning of the fiscal year 
the closure of the five restaurants reduced sales in the current year by million 
the same store sales decrease of percent was the result of a percent decrease in guest counts partly offset by a percent increase in average check 
the percent decrease in guest counts reduced sales by million compared to the prior year period  while the percent increase in average check increased sales by million compared to the prior year period 
restaurant sales for stoney river legendary steaks increased million  or percent  to million during fiscal same store sales decreased percent 
the same store sales decrease of percent was the result of a percent decrease in average check partly offset by a percent increase in guest counts 
the percent decrease in average check decreased sales by million compared to the prior year period  while the percent increase in guest counts increased sales by million compared to the prior year period 
the reduction due to the same store sales decrease was offset by the comparative net sales increase resulting from the timing of store openings and closures 
cost of food and beverage during fiscal  our cost of food and beverage was million  or percent of restaurant sales  compared with million  or percent of restaurant sales  in the same prior year period 
a number of factors contributed to this million decrease in food and beverage costs 
in addition to changes in trends in consumer behavior  we routinely adjust our product offerings  pricing  and promotional incentives among other factors that collectively comprise our product mix during any given period 
during the year  we believe the changes to our product mix increased our cost of food and beverage by approximately million 
this increase was partly offset by a million decrease in cost of food and beverage attributable to our decline in sales and a million decrease attributed to a reduction in our commodity costs for beef and wheat  partly offset by increase in costs for seafood 
payroll and benefits during fiscal  payroll and benefits were million  or percent of restaurant sales  compared to million  or percent of restaurant sales  in payroll and benefit costs as a percentage of restaurant sales was essentially flat when compared to fiscal due to the de leveraging impact of lower average weekly sales offset by net reductions in other payroll and benefits costs 
the million year over year decline is due primarily to lower payroll of million due primarily to lower sales  reduced bonus expense of million due to our operating performance  a reduction in payroll taxes of million primarily related from adoption of the hiring incentives to restore employment hire act  and reduced insurance costs of million  partly offset by an increased investment in training of million  reflecting our retraining and certification efforts 
the hire act was not extended to fiscal  therefore  we do not expect continued reductions in payroll taxes 
restaurant operating costs during fiscal  restaurant operating costs were million  or percent of restaurant sales  compared to million  or percent of restaurant sales  in the million year over year increase is due primarily to a million increase to repair and maintenance costs and a million an increase in our general liability cost due to claims experience 
advertising and marketing expenses during fiscal  advertising and marketing expenditures were million  or percent of total revenues  compared to million  or percent of total revenues  in the million year over year increase is due to increased investment in television  radio  and print media in our efforts to support our value offerings and message 
general and administrative expenses during fiscal  general and administrative expenses were million  or percent of total revenues  compared to million in  or percent of total revenues in this net basis point increase in general and administrative expenses is due to the de leveraging impact of lower sales and million of severance costs related to management changes and reductions in our support center staff 
excluding this severance charge  fiscal general and administrative costs were slightly below fiscal as a percentage of total revenues 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was million  or percent of total revenues  as compared to million  or percent of total revenues  in this reduction in depreciation is primarily due to lower carrying values of assets following restaurant impairment charges recognized in the current and prior year periods 
impairment  disposal and restructuring charges  net impairment  disposal and restructuring charges  net were million  or percent of revenues  in  compared to million  or percent of revenues  in included in are impairment charges of million for o charley s restaurants  seven ninety nine restaurants and three surplus properties 
also included is million for exit and disposal costs relating to restaurant and other facility closures 
the remaining million relates to other net losses on asset disposals 
included in are impairment charges of million on eight o charley s restaurants  six ninety nine restaurants and two stoney river restaurants 
the remaining million charge relates to restructuring costs related to the closing of our bellingham  ma distribution facility and the sale of a non core asset 
pre opening costs pre opening costs during fiscal were insignificant compared to million during fiscal this decrease in pre opening costs was the result of no new restaurant development during the fiscal year 
interest expense  net our net interest expense was million  or percent of total revenues  in  as compared to million  or percent of total revenues  in this million increase is due to charges associated with changes in the value of deferred compensation balances  partly offset by reduced levels of debt 
income taxes for we have recorded income tax benefit of million  compared with million of tax expense in the prior year 
our tax benefit includes only the portion associated with continuing operations 
this reflects a rate of percent applied against our full year pretax loss  adjusting for changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in accruals for uncertain tax positions 
loss from discontinued operations  net during fiscal  we recorded a million loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes  compared to a loss of million in during fiscal  we closed nine restaurants that were treated as discontinued operations 
asset impairment charges related to these closed restaurants were million and exit and disposal costs were million  primarily severance and the present value of future lease obligations  net of expected sublease income 
in addition  these restaurants had a combined net loss from operations of million during fiscal during fiscal  we recorded a million loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes  which included million from asset impairments and a million net loss from operations related to the nine restaurants closed in fiscal year compared with fiscal year overview the comparison between our financial results in and our financial results in was impacted by a number of developments in such years 
we continued to experience declines in same store sales and average weekly sales at each of our concepts due to the economic environment during fiscal during fiscal  there were impairment  disposal and restructuring charges of million and charges of million of additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets 
during fiscal  there were goodwill impairment charges of million  charges of million to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and million of impairment  disposal and restructuring charges 
the following discussion on year over year results pertains only to those locations included in our continuing operations 
revenues the economic environment negatively impacted our sales and guest counts in during fiscal  total revenues decreased million  or percent  to million from million in in  average check and guest visits decreased at all of our concepts 
we believe that the decrease in guest counts and average weekly check was due primarily to weak consumer demand caused by the current economic environment 
as consumers became more value conscious  we offered a greater variety of lower priced menu options and discounts 
we opened two company owned restaurants and closed two company owned restaurants during fiscal restaurant sales for o charley s decreased million  or percent  to million during fiscal  reflecting a decline in same store sales of percent 
the same store sales decrease of percent was the result of a percent decrease in guest counts and a percent decrease in average check 
the percent decrease in guest counts reduced sales by million compared to the prior year period  while the percent decrease in average check decreased sales by million compared to the prior year period 
this decrease in sales was partly offset by million attributed to the net impact from the timing of store openings and closures during fiscal and restaurant sales for ninety nine decreased million  or percent  to million during fiscal  reflecting a decrease in same store sales of percent 
the same store sales decrease of percent was the result of a percent decrease in average check and a percent decrease in guest counts 
the percent decrease in average check decreased sales by million compared to the prior year period  while the percent decrease in guest counts reduced sales by million compared to the prior year period 
this decrease in sales was partly offset by million attributed to the net impact from the timing of store openings and closures during fiscal and restaurant sales for stoney river legendary steaks decreased million  or percent  to million during fiscal  reflecting a same store sales decrease of percent 
the same store sales decrease of percent was the result of a percent decrease in guest counts and a percent decrease in average check 
the percent decrease in guest counts decreased sales by million compared to the prior year period  while the percent decrease in average check reduced sales by million compared to the prior year period 
this decrease in sales was partly offset by million attributed to the net impact from the timing of store openings and closures during fiscal and cost of food and beverage during fiscal  our cost of food and beverage was million  or percent of restaurant sales  compared with million  or percent of restaurant sales  in the same prior year period 
a number of factors contributed to this million decrease in food and beverage costs 
in addition to changes and trends in consumer behavior  we routinely adjust our product offerings  pricing and promotional incentives among other factors that collectively comprise our product mix during any given period 
during fiscal  we believe the change to our product mix increased our cost of food and beverage by approximately million 
this increase was partly offset by million decrease in costs of food and beverage attributable to our decline in sales and a million decrease attributed to a reduction in our commodity costs for beef  dairy and cheese  partly offset by an increase in costs for poultry 
payroll and benefits during fiscal  payroll and benefits were million  or percent of restaurant sales  compared to million  or percent of restaurant sales in the increase in payroll and benefit costs as a percentage of restaurant sales was due to the de leveraging impact of lower average weekly sales of basis points  partially offset by the positive impact of our labor cost management system  reduced turnover resulting in lower training expense  and reduction in the cost of our employee benefit plans of basis points 
restaurant operating costs during fiscal  restaurant operating costs were million  or percent of restaurant sales  compared to million  or percent of restaurant sales in reductions in general liability insurance expense  employee procurement and training costs due to reduced levels of employee turnover  as well as reductions in our utility costs  resulted in a basis point improvement as a percentage of restaurant sales 
this improvement was partly offset by the de leveraging impact of reduced sales on rent and other fixed costs of basis points 
advertising and marketing expenses during fiscal  advertising and marketing expenditures were million  or percent of total revenues  compared to million  or percent of total revenues in advertising and marketing expenditures  as a percent of total revenues  were essentially flat over the prior year 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased percent to million in from million in  and as a percentage of total revenues  decreased to percent from percent in the prior year 
this net basis point decrease in general and administrative expenses is the result of the reduction in support staffing late in  a company wide salary freeze implemented at the end of fiscal  and other reductions in spending of basis points  partly offset by increases in the value of deferred compensation from investment performance of the participant s self directed accounts of basis points 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was million or percent of total revenues  as compared to million  or percent of total revenues  in this reduction in expense is primarily due to lower carrying values of assets following restaurant impairments charges recognized in the prior year  as well as reduced capital expenditures compared to the prior year 
impairment  disposal and restructuring charges  net impairment  disposal and restructuring charges  net were million or percent of revenue in  compared to million or percent of revenue in included in are impairment charges of million on eight o charley s restaurants  six ninety nine restaurants and two stoney river restaurants 
the remaining million charge relates to restructuring costs related to the closing of our bellingham  ma distribution facility and the sale of a non core asset 
included in are impairment charges of million on five o charley s restaurants  eight ninety nine restaurants and two stoney river restaurants 
in addition  we sold our airplane and incurred other immaterial charges 
this impairment charge was partially offset by net gains on disposal of assets of million 
goodwill impairment due to the negative economic environment  the declining financial performance of other casual dining restaurant companies  as well as lower sales and higher commodity costs during fiscal  we believed the goodwill related to the acquisitions of the ninety nine and stoney river restaurants had indicators of impairment 
therefore  during  we tested for and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million related to our ninety nine restaurants and million related to our stoney river restaurants 
as a result  all related goodwill was written off in fiscal pre opening costs during fiscal  our pre opening costs decreased million to million  or percent of total revenues  compared with million  or percent of total revenues  in this decrease in pre opening costs was the result of fewer new restaurant openings and the suspension of our re branding initiatives 
during fiscal we opened one new ninety nine restaurant and one new stoney river restaurant and closed one ninety nine and one stoney river restaurant 
interest expense  net our net interest expense was million or percent of total revenues in  as compared to million  or percent of total revenues in this basis point improvement is primarily due to an approximate basis point increase in earnings in the value of deferred compensation related to investment performance of the participant s self directed accounts  offset by the net reduction in interest income from swap arrangements which ended in fiscal during fiscal  we paid off our revolver balance of million  paid down our capital lease obligations by million  and paid down other borrowings by approximately million 
income taxes for fiscal  we recorded income tax expense of million  compared with million of tax expense in fiscal our tax expense includes only the portion associated with continuing operations 
the effective tax rate for is unusually high due to tax expense exceeding the pretax loss 
in addition  the impact of having tax expense on a pretax loss produces a negative rate consistent with the prior year 
tax expense is primarily attributable to state taxes  disallowed stock compensation expense and the change in valuation allowance  offset by tax credits 
loss from discontinued operations  net during fiscal  we closed nine restaurants that were treated as discontinued operations 
during fiscal  we recorded a million loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes  compared to a loss of million during fiscal during fiscal  we recorded asset impairment charges of million and a million net loss from operations related to these nine restaurants 
during fiscal  we recorded asset impairment charges of million and a million net loss from operations related to these nine restaurants 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of capital have historically been cash provided by operations  borrowings under our credit facilities and capital leases 
our principal capital needs have historically arisen from property and equipment additions  acquisitions  and payments on long term debt and capitalized lease obligations 
in addition  we lease a substantial number of our restaurants under operating leases and have substantial operating lease obligations 
like many restaurant companies  our working capital has historically had current liabilities in excess of current assets due to collection of our sales being received in four days or less while our typical accounts payable turnover  excluding food invoices  averages thirty days 
we do not believe this indicates a lack of liquidity 
we have slowed our restaurant development in recent years in order to focus on improving the performance of our existing restaurants and reducing our debt 
as a result of these reductions in investment  our cash balances have increased  at december  and december   and our working capital deficit has decreased by million since the end of fiscal we did not open any company owned restaurants at any of our concepts in and we have no plans to develop any new restaurants in the following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the last three years in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities decreased in from by approximately percent or million 
this reduction in net cash provided by operating activities is due to a million reduction in net earnings  after adjusting for non cash charges  partly offset by a million net increase in the change in working capital and other long term assets and liabilities over the prior year 
the million increase is primarily due to partly offsetting changes in accounts payable and inventory 
the change in accounts payable is primarily due to the large reduction in payables in due to reductions to credit balances with certain financial institutions  the outsourcing of our bellingham  massachusetts distribution operations during  and lower construction payables due to less construction activity at the end of as compared to partly offsetting the changes in accounts payable were changes in inventory due to the phase out of our bellingham  massachusetts distribution operations and the use of inventory resulting from previous buying opportunities 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased in from by approximately percent or million  from million to million 
this reduction in net cash provided by operating activities is due to a million reduction in net earnings  after adjusting for non cash charges  and a million net reduction in the change in working capital and other long term assets and liabilities over the prior year 
the million is primarily due to partly offsetting changes in accounts payable and inventory 
accounts payable decreased due to reductions to credit balances with certain financial institutions  the outsourcing of our bellingham  massachusetts distribution operations during  and lower construction payables due to less construction activity at the end of as compared to partly offsetting accounts payables were reductions in inventory due to the phase out of our bellingham  massachusetts distribution operations and the use of inventory resulting from buying opportunities 
we believe that our various sources of capital  including cash flow from operating activities  availability under our credit facility  and the ability to acquire additional financing  are adequate to fund our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
as of the end of fiscal year  the balances on our revolving credit facility and capital lease obligations were million and million  respectively 
as of the end of fiscal  there were no amounts outstanding on our revolving credit facility and million outstanding on our capital lease obligations 
as of the end of fiscal  there were no amounts outstanding on our revolving credit facility and million outstanding on our capital lease obligations 
we do not expect to rely on our credit facility as a significant source of funds during fiscal year on january   we amended our credit agreement to enhance our financial flexibility 
the maximum borrowing capacity was reduced from million which was already scheduled to be reduced to million on april  to million 
the maximum adjusted leverage ratio was reduced from to 
the definitions of adjusted leverage ratio and senior secured ratio were changed  and the limit on expansion capital expenditures is percent of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda in and percent of ebitda in subsequent years 
under the amended credit agreement  we are permitted to repurchase our senior subordinated notes due in  subject to certain limitations 
the amended credit agreement also reduced the number of our company owned restaurants subject to collateral mortgages from to the amended credit agreement also reset the restricted payments basket for dividends and bond repurchases  however  such payments are currently restricted by the bond indenture governing our senior subordinated notes due in the amended credit agreement also permits sale leaseback transactions  subject to certain limitations 
in the event of a disruption or cessation of operations by one or more participants in our credit facility  rendering them unable to fund their portion of any credit facility drawings  we believe that the available capacity from the other banks in the credit facility would be sufficient to permit us to continue meeting our current obligations and funding our operating activities 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all covenants included in the amended credit agreement 
we have four separate lease agreements that cover an aggregate of of our ninety nine restaurants  each of which contains a fixed charge covenant calculation 
each of the four restaurant groups are subject to an annual fixed charge coverage ratio of to 
each of these lease agreements were in compliance with this covenant as of the end of fiscal in  and  net cash flows used by investing activities included capital expenditures incurred principally for improvements to existing restaurants and improvements in our information systems 
we did not finance any capital expenditures during capital expenditures for  and  excluding new computer equipment financed through capital lease obligations in  were as follows in thousands new restaurant capital expenditures re model capital expenditures other capital expenditures total capital expenditures we project capital expenditures of between million and million for fiscal during fiscal  net cash used in financing activities was million primarily related to the repurchase of million of our senior notes  million for capital lease and other debt payments and million of debt issuance costs related to our third amended and restated credit agreement entered into during the first fiscal quarter of during fiscal  net cash used in financing activities was million primarily related to the payoff of our revolving credit balance of million and capital lease and other debt payments of million  partly offset by payments from the counterparties of our swap agreements to exit the agreement in exchange for million 
during fiscal  net cash used in financing activities was million primarily related to the repurchase of shares of our common stock for million  capital lease and other debt payments of million and dividend payments of million  partly offset by drawings on our credit facility of million 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables set forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  in thousands payments due by period less more than than contractual obligation total yr yrs yrs years long term debt  excluding credit facility long term debt interest capitalized lease obligations operating leases uncertain tax positions unconditional purchase obligations total contractual obligations amount of commitment expiration per period less more than than other commercial commitments total yr yrs yrs years line of credit this interest primarily relates to million in outstanding principal amount of senior subordinated notes with stated interest rate of percent 
these purchase obligations are primarily food obligations with fixed commitments in regards to the time period of the contract with annual price adjustments that can fluctuate and a fixed beverage contract with an annual price adjustment 
in situations where the price is based on market prices  we use the existing market prices at december  to determine the amount of the obligation 
total unconditional purchase obligations shown are based on variable pricing that is adjusted annually 
the company has a million line of credit at december  at december   we had no amounts outstanding on this credit facility 
we had million of outstanding letters of credit as of december  as of december   we had million of remaining borrowing capacity under our credit facility 
franchise arrangements on december   we entered into a multi unit franchise agreement with meritage hospitality group  inc meritage  which currently operates three o charley s restaurants in michigan 
on july   we entered into a termination and release agreement terminating the development agreement with meritage 
previously paid fees for future development of  were forfeited by meritage and recognized as franchise revenue during fiscal on may   we entered into a development agreement with o candall group  inc and sam covelli 
under the terms of the agreement  o candall group  inc and or certain of its affiliates have the right to develop and operate up to new o charley s restaurants by november the development plans focus on the tampa  florida  orlando  florida  western pennsylvania  northwest west virginia and northern ohio markets 
as of december   the o candall group  inc operates five o charley s restaurants 
the franchising arrangement requires us to provide access to certain contractual arrangements that we have with our vendors in order for the franchisee to benefit from those contracts 
the development fees for the franchisee are  each for the initial restaurants and  each for the remaining restaurants in each of its five granted areas 
the franchisee is also required to pay a franchise fee and marketing fund fee that are based on a percentage of sales 
pursuant to the arrangement  the franchisee was required to pay  as development fees at the closing of the agreement  which represents a portion of the fees associated with the restaurants agreed upon 
the franchisee is required to pay the remaining amount of the development fees to us as each new restaurant opens 
no development fees for new restaurant openings were recognized in the company recognized income of  in development fees in for the opening of two restaurants and  in development fees for fiscal related to the opening of a franchised restaurant in each of those fiscal years 
the remaining development fees paid have been deferred and will be recognized in income as each restaurant opens

the fees for the franchisee were  for the restaurant 
the franchisee is also required to pay a franchise fee that is based on a percentage of sales 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period see note to our consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are as follows lease accounting share based compensation property and equipment trademarks impairment of long lived assets income taxes lease accounting our policy for lease accounting involves recognizing rent on a straight line basis from the time we are committed to a leased property  which is when all contingencies associated with the delivery of the property by the landlord are taken care of  to the end of the estimated lease term  which may include one or more renewal periods 
the useful life over which leasehold improvements are depreciated is the shorter of the estimated useful life or the estimated lease term  which may include one or more renewal periods 
we also recognize tenant allowances as a deferred rent liability and amortize them over the estimated lease term  which may include one or more renewal periods 
based upon the size of the investment that we make at a restaurant site  the economic penalty incurred by discontinuing use of the leased facility  our historical experience with respect to the length of time a restaurant operates at a specific location  and leases that typically have multiple five year renewal options that are exercised entirely at our discretion  we have concluded that one five year renewal option is reasonably assured 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with fasb asc  compensation stock compensation  fasb asc  requires the measurement and recognition of compensation cost at fair value for all share based payments including stock options 
share based compensation for fiscal years   and includes compensation expense  recognized over the applicable vesting periods for share based awards granted prior to these fiscal years  as well as awards granted during these fiscal years 
we use the black scholes merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options on their grant dates 
the black scholes merton option pricing model requires various assumptions including the risk free rate  the expected term  the expected dividend yield  and the stock price volatility 
if any of these assumptions used in the model change  share based compensation expense may differ in the future from that recorded in the current period 
the company s policy is to recognize compensation cost for restricted awards with only service conditions and a graded vesting schedule on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
compensation expense is recognized for only the portion of options and restricted awards that are expected to vest 
therefore  an estimated forfeiture rate derived from historical employee terminations is applied against share based compensation expense 
the forfeiture rate is applied on a straight line basis over the service vesting period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was in substance  multiple awards 
property and equipment  net the company had million of property and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  at december  our property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over the following estimated useful lives building and improvements years  and furniture  fixtures and equipment to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the asset s estimated useful life or the expected lease term  inclusive of one renewal period 
equipment under capital leases is amortized to its expected residual value at the end of the lease term 
gains or losses are recognized upon the disposal of property and equipment  and the asset and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts 
maintenance  repairs and betterments that do not enhance the value of or increase the life of the assets are expensed as incurred 
we capitalize all direct external costs associated with obtaining the land  building and equipment for each new restaurant  as well as construction period interest 
we also capitalize all direct external costs associated with obtaining the dining room and kitchen equipment  signage and other assets and equipment for each re branded restaurant 
in addition  for each new restaurant and re branded restaurant we also capitalize a portion of the internal direct costs of our real estate and construction department 
to determine our accounting policies related to capitalizing costs associated with our in house real estate department  we have taken guidance from fasb asc  real estate general fasb asc 
while fasb asc establishes accounting and reporting standards for the acquisition  development  construction  selling and rental costs associated with real estate projects  it excludes from its scope real estate developed by an enterprise for use in its own operations  other than for sale of rental 
given there is no other authoritative literature directly addressing our circumstance of developing real estate projects for our own operations  we have applied the principles of fasb asc in such accounting for costs 
inherent in the policies regarding property and equipment are certain significant management judgments and estimates  including useful life  residual value to which the asset is depreciated  the expected value at the end of the lease term for equipment under capital leases  and the determination as to what constitutes enhancing the value of or increasing the life of assets 
these significant estimates and judgments  coupled with the fact that the ultimate useful life and economic value at the end of a lease are typically not known until after the passage of time  through proper maintenance of the asset  or through continued development and maintenance of a given market in which a restaurant operates can  under certain circumstances  produce distorted or inaccurate depreciation and amortization or  in some cases result in a write down of the value of the assets 
see critical accounting policy impairment of long lived assets below 
we believe that our accounting policy for property and equipment provides a reasonably accurate means by which the costs associated with an asset are recognized in expense as the cash flows associated with the asset s use are realized 
trademarks intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually 
at december   we had million in indefinite lived intangible assets shown on our consolidated balance sheets related primarily to the acquisition of ninety nine restaurants 
the determination of whether these assets are impaired involves significant judgments based upon short and long term projections of future sales performance 
changes in strategy  new accounting pronouncements and or market conditions may result in future impairment of recorded asset balances 
we completed a valuation of the intangibles as of december   the last day of fiscal  and our valuation showed that the fair value of the intangible asset substantially exceeded its net book value and no impairment charge was needed 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets based upon the future highest and best use of the impaired assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the cost associated with asset impairments are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in the financial statement line item impairment  disposal and restructuring charges  net 
the judgments made related to the ultimate expected useful life and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying value of an asset are affected by such issues as ongoing maintenance of the asset  continued development of a given market within which a restaurant operates  including the presence of traffic generating businesses in the area  and our ability to operate the restaurant efficiently and effectively 
we assess the projected cash flows and carrying values at the restaurant level  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the long lived assets associated with a restaurant may not be recoverable 
in determining projected cash flow  we make key assumptions regarding sales growth  food and labor and other restaurant operating costs  as well as local market expectations 
in the event that our economic expectations are not met  estimated future cash flows could be negatively impacted  which may result in a material impairment charge we believe that our accounting policy for impairment of long lived assets provides reasonable assurance that any assets that are impaired are written down to their fair value and a charge is taken in operating earnings on a timely basis 
long lived assets are tested for possible impairment each fiscal quarter 
during we recorded total impairment  disposal and restructuring charges  net  of million 
included are impairment charges of million on o charley s restaurants  seven ninety nine restaurants and three surplus properties 
also included is million for exit and disposal costs relating to restaurant and facility closures 
the remaining million relates to other net losses on asset disposals 
during we recorded total impairment  disposal and restructuring charges  net of million 
included are impairment charges of million on eight o charley s restaurants  six ninety nine restaurants  and two stoney river restaurants 
the remaining million charge relates to restructuring costs related to the closing of our bellingham  ma distribution facility and the sale of a non core asset 
during  we recorded total impairment  disposal and restructuring charges  net  of million 
included are impairment charges of million on five o charley s restaurants  eight ninety nine restaurants and two stoney river restaurants 
in addition  we sold our airplane and incurred other immaterial charges 
this impairment charge was partially offset by net gains on the disposal of assets of million 
income taxes we must make estimates of certain items that comprise our income tax provision and the related current and deferred tax liabilities 
these estimates include employer tax credits for items such as fica taxes paid on employee tip income  work opportunity and welfare to work credits  as well as estimates related to certain depreciation and capitalization policies 
these estimates are made based on the best available information at the time of the provision and historical experience 
we file our income tax returns many months after our year end 
these returns are subject to audit by various federal  state and local governments several years after the returns are filed and could be subject to differing interpretations of the tax laws 
we are also required to perform an analysis and measure each uncertain tax position 
the analysis and measurement requires estimates and interpretations to be made 
we base these estimates upon the best available information at that time of the provision and in coordination with our interpretation of existing tax law 
as part of the computation of the income tax provision  we identify and measure deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we weigh available evidence in determining the realization of deferred tax assets 
available evidence includes historical  current and future financial performance of the company 
we also consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
if we determine it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be recognized  the deferred tax asset will be reduced by a valuation allowance 
the deferred tax valuation allowance may be released in future years when we consider that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
to form a conclusion that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized  we will need to generate three year cumulative pre tax income  and we will need to periodically evaluate whether or not all available evidence  such as future taxable income and reversal of temporary differences  provides sufficient positive evidence to offset any other potential negative evidence that may exist at such time 
in the event the deferred tax valuation allowance is released  we would record an income tax benefit for the portion or all of the deferred tax valuation allowance released 
at december   the company had a deferred tax valuation allowance of million 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january   the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  fair value measurements and disclosures asu  which adds new disclosure requirements for transfers into and out of levels and in the fair value hierarchy and additional disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements relating to level fair value measurements 
this asu also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the asu was effective at the beginning of fiscal  except for the requirement to provide the level activity on a gross basis  which is effective for the fiscal year ends beginning after december  and interim periods within those years 
this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in and we do not expect this statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in in july  the fasb issued new accounting guidance that requires new disclosures about an entity s allowance for credit losses and the credit quality of its financing receivables 
existing disclosures are amended to require an entity to provide certain disclosures on a disaggregated basis by portfolio segment of by class of financing receivables 
the new disclosures as of the end of a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after december  the disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after december  this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  nor do we expect this statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in the future 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the cost of food  labor  equipment  and fuel energy costs could adversely affect our operations 
a majority of our employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws 
the federal government and several states have instituted or are considering changes to their minimum wage and or benefit related laws which  if and when enacted  could have an adverse impact on our payroll and benefit costs 
in addition  most of our leases require us to pay taxes  insurance  maintenance  repairs and utility costs  and these costs are subject to inflationary pressures 
commodity inflation has had a significant impact on our operating costs 
we attempt to offset the effect of inflation through periodic menu price increases  economies of scale in purchasing and cost controls and efficiencies at our restaurants 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing  investing and cash management activities and fluctuations in commodity prices 
our fixed rate debt consists primarily of capitalized lease obligations and senior subordinated notes and our variable rate debt consists primarily of our credit facility 
a significant portion of our debt is at a fixed rate  therefore a one percent fluctuation in interest rates is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations 
we purchase certain commodities such as beef  pork  poultry  seafood  produce  and dairy 
these commodities are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
these purchase arrangements may contain contractual features that fix the price paid for certain commodities 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices because these purchase arrangements help control the ultimate cost paid and any commodity price aberrations are generally short term in nature
