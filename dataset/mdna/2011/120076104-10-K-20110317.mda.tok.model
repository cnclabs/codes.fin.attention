overview we are the leading  and only international  company providing a make your own stuffed animal interactive entertainment experience under the build a bear workshop brand  in which our guests stuff  fluff  dress  accessorize and name their own teddy bears and other stuffed animals 
our concept  which we developed for mall based retailing  capitalizes on what we believe is the relatively untapped demand for experience based shopping as well as the widespread appeal of stuffed animals 
the build a bear workshop experience appeals to a broad range of age groups and demographics  including children  teens  their parents and grandparents 
as of january   we operated stores in the united states  canada and puerto rico  stores in the united kingdom and two stores in ireland  and had franchised stores operating in international locations under the build a bear workshop brand 
in addition to our stores  we sell our products on our e commerce web site  buildabear 
com and market our products and build our brand through our virtual world web site  bearville 
com  which complements our interactive shopping experience and positively enhances our core brand value 
we also operate non traditional store locations in major league baseball ballparks  temporary pop up locations  one location in a zoo and one location in a science center 
on april   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of the bear factory limited  a stuffed animal retailer in the united kingdom  and amsbra limited  our former united kingdom franchisee 
the results of the acquisitions operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements since that date 
we are currently operating of the acquired stores  having permanently closed four locations during transition 
since  our european operations have grown to stores 
we have improved sales performance and adopted internal best practices in the areas of merchandising  marketing  purchasing and store operations  across the acquired store base that resulted in improved sales and earnings from the acquisition 
we operate in three segments that share the same infrastructure  including management  systems  merchandising and marketing  and generate revenues as follows company owned retail stores located in the united states  canada  puerto rico  the united kingdom and ireland  a webstore and seasonal  event based locations  international stores operated under franchise agreements  and transactions with other business partners  mainly comprised of licensing our intellectual property  including entertainment properties  for third party use and wholesale product sales 
selected financial data attributable to each segment for fiscal  and  are set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
for a discussion of the key trends and uncertainties that have affected our revenues  income and liquidity  see the revenues  costs and expenses and expansion and growth potential subsections of this overview 
we believe that we have developed an appealing retail store concept that  for north american stores open for the entire year  averaged million in fiscal and fiscal and million in fiscal in net retail sales per store 
for a discussion of the changes in comparable store sales in fiscal years  and  see revenues below 
store contribution  which consists of income loss before income tax expense benefit  interest  store depreciation  amortization and impairment  store preopening expense  store closing expense  losses from investment in affiliate and general and administrative expense  excluding franchise fees  income from commercial activities and contribution from our webstore  pop ups and seasonal event based locations  as a percentage of net retail sales  excluding revenue from our webstore  pop ups and seasonal and event based locations  was for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal total company net income as a percentage of total revenues was for fiscal and for fiscal total company net loss as a percentage of total revenues was for fiscal see non gaap financial measures for a reconciliation of store contribution to net income 
net income increased in due to stable store sales trends  continued cost reductions  improvements in margin and leverage of fixed costs 
additionally  certain non cash charges included in did not recur  or were significantly lower in net income declined in and due primarily to the decrease in comparable store sales and in due to the impact of certain non cash charges 
in and  merchandise margin improvement was more than offset by fixed occupancy cost deleverage due primarily to the decrease in comparable store sales 
in  and  our results reflect the challenging retail environment economic recession  declining mall traffic  and slowing consumer spending factors impacting many retailers and particularly our company given the discretionary nature of our products and our experience 
in  our store contribution increased  primarily due to a significant decrease in store asset impairment charges as compared to as well as improvements in margin and leverage of fixed store costs 
in and  our total store contribution declined  primarily due to and decreases in comparable store sales  respectively 
this decrease in total store contribution was partially offset by approximately million in cost reductions in north america in our plan balances our long term business goals while recognizing the continuing challenges of the retail environment 
while we believe our market potential in north america remains more than stores  we will open two new stores in north america in  compared to one in  excluding temporary pop up locations 
in the united kingdom and ireland  we believe our market potential is approximately locations and we plan to open three new stores in  the same as in this slower pace of new store growth allows us to focus on our business and align all operations around our goals of new guest acquisition and guest retention aimed at improving our comparable stores sales performance  while also building our long term brand value 
our growth strategy is to develop and expand the reach of the build a bear workshop brand through product innovation and the full integration of product  marketing and operations to create a sense of urgency to shop  thereby increasing store traffic  increasing conversion and improving sales 
we will continue to look for opportunities to add other toy products outside of our core plush animals  yet consistent with our interactive and hands on experience when we see an opportunity to drive incremental purchases 
we plan to continue to improve our online and e commerce business  as well as grow our virtual world engagement through bearville 
com 
we intend to refine our marketing programs balancing communication with new and existing guests and place emphasis on our product newness and collectibility  a fundamental strength of our brand 
in  we implemented cost reduction initiatives that resulted in approximately million in pre tax savings 
we were able to maintain these savings in we ended fiscal with no borrowings under our bank loan agreement and with million in cash and cash equivalents after investing million in capital projects and million in share repurchases 
our comparable store sales trend reflected a significant improvement over  and we believe that our business strategies  strong store contribution model  strong cash flow and flexible capital structure will deliver long term sales and earnings growth 
following is a description and discussion of the major components of our statement of operations revenues net retail sales net retail sales are revenues from retail sales including our webstore and other non store locations  are net of discounts  exclude sales tax  include shipping and handling costs billed to customers  and are recognized at the time of sale 
revenues from gift cards are recognized at the time of redemption 
our guests use cash  checks  gift cards and third party credit cards to make purchases 
we classify stores as new or comparable stores and do not include our webstore or seasonal  event based locations in our store count or in our comparable store calculations 
stores enter the comparable store calculation in their thirteenth full month of operation and as such  european stores were not included for if a store relocation or remodel results in a significant change in square footage  the net retail sales for that location are excluded from comparable store sales calculations until the thirteenth full month of operation after the date of the change 
in the fiscal third quarter  we announced plans to close the friends b made concept 
by the end of fiscal  all friends b made locations were closed 
all but one of these locations were inside or adjacent to a build a bear workshop store and shared common store management  employees and infrastructure 
other than one stand alone store in ontario  california  these locations were considered expansions of the existing build a bear workshop store and were not considered an addition to our total store count 
the net retail sales of these expanded build a bear workshop stores were excluded from comparable store sales calculations until the thirteenth full month of operation after the date of the expansion as well as after the subsequent closure 
we have a loyalty program with a frequent shopper reward feature in north america  the stuff fur stuff club  whereby guests enroll in the program and receive one point for every dollar or partial dollar spent and after reaching points receive a discount on a future purchase 
on a quarterly basis  an estimate of the obligation related to the program  based on actual points and certificates outstanding and historical point conversion and certificate redemption pattern  is recorded as an adjustment to deferred revenue and net retail sales 
at the time of redemption of the discount  the deferred revenue obligation is reduced  and a corresponding amount is recognized in net retail sales 
as the reward certificates can be earned or redeemed at any of our store locations  we account for changes in the deferred revenue account at the total company level only 
therefore  when we refer to net retail sales by location  such as comparable stores or new stores  these amounts do not include any changes in the deferred revenue amount 
see critical accounting estimates for additional details on the accounting for the deferred revenue program 
we use net retail sales per gross square foot and comparable store sales as performance measures for our business

our older stores consistently perform the best on both a sales per square foot and a comparable store sales basis 
fiscal consolidated comparable store sales decreased by  including a decrease in europe and a decrease in north america full year comparable store sales are compared to the week period ended jan 
 
we believe the decline in consolidated comparable store sales was attributed primarily to the following factors the continuing impact of the economic recession and resulting pullback in consumer spending impacted our comparable store sales particularly in europe 
while these factors impact many retailers  we believe that they impact our comparable store sales particularly given the discretionary nature of our products and our experience 
we believe that our product selection and improved integration of product marketing and store operations positively impacted our north american comparable store sales trend in by improving our average transaction value 
fiscal consolidated comparable store sales decreased by  including a increase in europe and a decline in north america full year comparable store sales are compared to the week period ended jan 
 
we believe the decline in consolidated comparable store sales was attributed primarily to the following factors the economic recession and dramatic decrease in consumer sentiment resulted in a pullback in consumer spending and impacted our comparable store sales  and the slowdown in north america shopping mall customer traffic during fiscal compared to fiscal impacted the number of new and returning guests visiting our stores and therefore our comparable store sales

store contribution consists of income before income tax expense  interest  store depreciation and amortization  store preopening expense  store closing expense and general and administrative expense  excluding franchise fees  income from licensing activities and contribution from our web store and seasonal and event based locations 
this term  as we define it  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and is not a measure of performance presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we use store contribution as a measure of our stores operating performance 
store contribution should not be considered a substitute for net income  net income per store  cash flows provided by operating activities  cash flows provided by operating activities per store  or other income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with us gaap 
we believe store contribution is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance because it  along with the number of stores in operation  directly impacts our profitability

seasonality and quarterly results the following is a summary of certain unaudited quarterly results of operations data for each of the last two fiscal years

as a toy retailer  our sales are highest in our fourth quarter  followed by the first quarter 
the timing of holidays and school vacations can impact our quarterly results 
historically  for north american stores  seasonality has not been a significant factor in our results of operations as the opening of new stores has mitigated the impact of the relative concentration of sales in the fourth quarter 
our european based stores have historically been more heavily weighted in the fourth quarter as compared to our north american stores 
we cannot ensure that this will continue to be the case 
our operating results for one period may not be indicative of results for other periods  and may fluctuate significantly because of a variety of factors  including those discussed under risk factors risks related to owning our common stock fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations could cause the price of our common stock to substantially decline 
the timing of new store openings may result in fluctuations in quarterly results as a result of the revenues and expenses associated with each new store location 
we typically incur most preopening costs for a new store in the three months immediately preceding the store s opening 
we expect our growth  operating results and profitability to depend in some degree on our ability to increase our number of stores 
for accounting purposes  the quarters of each fiscal year consist of weeks  although we will have a week quarter approximately once every six years

as of january  i we were in compliance with these covenants  ii there were no borrowings under our line of credit  iii there was a standby letter of credit of approximately million outstanding under the credit agreement and iv there was approximately million available for borrowing under the line of credit 
most of our retail stores are located within shopping malls and all are operated under leases classified as operating leases 
our leases in north america typically have a ten year term and contain provisions for base rent plus percentage rent based on defined sales levels 
many of the leases contain a provision whereby either we or the landlord may terminate the lease after a certain time  typically in the third to fourth year of the lease  if a certain minimum sales volume is not achieved 
many leases contain incentives to help defray the cost of construction of a new store 
typically  a portion of the incentive must be repaid to the landlord if we choose to terminate the lease 
in addition  some of these leases contain various restrictions relating to change of control of our company 
our leases also subject us to risks relating to compliance with changing mall rules and the exercise of discretion by our landlords on various matters  including rights of termination in some cases 
our leases in the united kingdom and ireland typically have terms of to years and generally contain a provision whereby every fifth year the rental rate can be adjusted to reflect the current market rates 
the leases typically provide the lessee with the first right for renewal at the end of the lease 
we may also be required to make deposits and rent guarantees to secure new leases as we expand 
real estate taxes also change according to government time schedules to reflect current market rental rates for the locations we lease 
rents are charged quarterly and paid in advance 
in fiscal  we expect to spend approximately to million on capital expenditures 
capital spending in fiscal totaled million 
capital spending in fiscal was primarily for the continued installation and upgrades of central office information technology systems  acquisition of intangible assets  the opening of four new stores and temporary pop up stores and the relocation of one store 
on february   we announced that our board of directors had authorized a million share repurchase program of our outstanding common stock 
on march   we announced an expansion of our share repurchase program to million 
on march   we announced that our share repurchase program had been extended to march  we currently intend to purchase up to an aggregate of million of our common stock in the open market including through b plans  through privately negotiated transactions or through an accelerated repurchase transaction 
the primary source of funding for the program is expected to be cash on hand 
the timing and amount of share repurchases  if any  will depend on price  market conditions  applicable regulatory requirements  and other factors 
the program does not require us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be modified  suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice 
shares repurchased under the program will be subsequently retired 
as of march   approximately million shares at an average price of per share have been repurchased under this program for an aggregate amount of million 
we believe that cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement will be sufficient to fund our working capital and other cash flow requirements for the near future 
our credit agreement expires on december  off balance sheet arrangements we hold a minority interest in ridemakerz  which is accounted for under the equity method 
we purchased a call option from a group of other ridemakerz investors for  for million ridemakerz common units at an exercise price of per unit 
the call option was immediately exercisable and expires april  simultaneously  we granted a put option to the same group of investors for million common units at an exercise price of per unit 
the put option was exercisable on april  and expires on april  as of january   the book value of our investment in ridemakerz was zero 
we still retained an ownership interest of approximately 
under the current agreements  we could own up to approximately of fully diluted equity in ridemakerz

contractual obligations and commercial commitments our contractual obligations and commercial commitments include future minimum obligations under operating leases and purchase obligations 
our purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for merchandise inventory 
the future minimum payments for these obligations as of january  for periods subsequent to this date are as follows payments due by fiscal period as of january  total beyond in thousands operating lease obligations purchase obligations total our total liability for uncertain tax positions under the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification asc section was million as of january  during the next fiscal year  it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits will be reduced by million either because the tax positions are sustained on audit or expiration of statute of limitations 
at this time  we do not expect a significant payment related to these obligations within the next year 
see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse impact on our business or operating results during the periods presented 
we cannot assure you  however  that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
we believe application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are periodically reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found our application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we have identified the following critical accounting estimates inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on an average cost basis 
historically  we have not conducted sales whereby we offer products below cost 
throughout the year we record an estimated cost of shortage based on past experience 
the amount accrued for shortage each period is based on detailed historical averages 
the accrual rate remained unchanged for fiscal  and periodic physical inventories are taken and any difference between the actual physical count of merchandise and the recorded amount in our records are adjusted and recorded as shortage 
historically  including fiscal years  and  the timing of the physical inventory has been in the fourth quarter so that no material amount of shortage was required to be estimated on activity between the date of the physical count and year end 
however  future physical counts of merchandise may not be at times at or near the end of a fiscal quarter or fiscal year end  and our estimate of shortage for the intervening period may be material based on the amount of time between the date of the physical inventory and the date of the fiscal quarter or year end 
long lived assets in accordance with asc section we assess the potential impairment of long lived assets annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset  or asset group  to expected future net cash flows generated by the asset  or asset group 
if the carrying amount exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows  the carrying amount is compared to its fair value and an impairment charge is recognized to the extent of the difference 
for purposes of evaluating store assets for impairment  we have determined that each store location is an asset group 
as of january   store assets represented approximately million  or approximately of total property  plant and equipment  net 
factors that we consider important which could individually or in combination trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant changes in our business strategies and or negative industry or economic trends 
we assess events and changes in circumstances or strategy that could potentially indicate that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable as they occur 
due to the significance of the fourth quarter to individual store locations  we assess store performance annually  using the full year s results 
we consider a historical and or projected negative cash flow trend for a store location to be an indicator that the carrying value of that asset group may not be recoverable 
as a result of our review  we determined that several stores would not be able to recover the carrying value of certain store leasehold improvements through expected undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the related assets 
accordingly  we reduced the carrying value of the assets to fair value  calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows for each asset group and recorded asset impairment charges of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which is included in cost of merchandise sold 
the calculation of fair value could increase or decrease depending on changes in the inputs and assumptions used  such as changes in the financial performance of the asset group  future growth rate and discount rate 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value assumptions on store asset impairment  we applied a hypothetical decrease of in the comparable stores sales trend and in margin  which we believe is appropriate 
based on the analysis performed as of january   the changes in our assumptions would have resulted in additional impairment charges of million 
as a result of our review  we determined that several stores would not be able to recover the carrying value of certain store leasehold improvements through expected undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the related assets 
accordingly  we reduced the carrying value of the assets to fair value  calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows for each asset group and recorded asset impairment charges of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which is included in cost of merchandise sold 
as a result of our review  we determined that several stores would not be able to recover the carrying value of certain store leasehold improvements through expected undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the related assets 
accordingly  we reduced the carrying value of the assets to fair value  calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows for each asset group  and recorded asset impairment charges of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which is included in cost of merchandise sold 
in the event that we decide to close any or all of these stores in the future  we may be required to record additional impairments  lease termination fees  severance and other charges 
impairment losses in the future are dependent on a number of factors such as site selection and general economic trends  and thus could be significantly different than historical results 
as we continue to face a challenging retail environment and general uncertainty in the global economy  the assumptions used in future calculations of fair value may change significantly which could result in further impairment charges in future periods 
in the fiscal third quarter  we announced plans to close our friends b made concept 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million  related to the closures 
in  we incurred additional pre tax charges of approximately million  primarily attributable to lease termination charges  inventory write offs and construction costs incurred to reformat locations for return to the landlord 
corporate assets  including computer hardware and software  media credits and the company owned distribution center approximately million as of january   and certain other assets  such as media credits and trademarks and intellectual property  net approximately million as of january   have a broad applicability and are generally considered to be recoverable  unless abandoned 
other long lived assets  including deferred franchise and lease costs approximately million as of january   are monitored in relation to the relevant franchisee or store location 
in  we determined that certain key money and long term lease deposits were no longer fully recoverable 
accordingly  we reduced the carrying value of the assets to their estimated fair value and recorded asset impairment charges of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which is included in cost of merchandise sold 
in the fiscal second quarter  we reviewed the inputs used to determine the fair value of certain key money deposits  included in other intangible assets and other store deposits  included in other assets  net  through expected undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the related assets 
accordingly  the carrying value of the assets was reduced to fair value  calculated as the net present value of estimated future cash flows for each asset group  and asset impairment charges of million were recorded in the second quarter of fiscal as we had determined at this time that we would be closing the related stores  these charges are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
none of these other long lived assets were impaired in fiscal goodwill we record goodwill related to the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
all of our recorded goodwill  which is associated with our uk acquisition  is recorded in the european reporting unit 
at january  and january   our goodwill balance was million and million  respectively 
the decrease is entirely due to foreign currency translation adjustments 
goodwill is subject to periodic evaluation for impairment when circumstances warrant  or at least once per year 
we perform our annual impairment assessment as of the end of the fourth quarter of each year 
impairment is tested in accordance with asc section  by comparison of the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value 
as there are not quoted prices for our reporting unit  fair value is estimated based upon a present value technique using estimated discounted future cash flows  forecasted over the reasonably assured lease terms for retail stores  with growth rates forecasted for the reporting unit and using a credit adjusted discount rate 
we use current results  trends  future prospects  and other economic factors as the basis for expected future cash flows 
our annual evaluation indicated that no impairment of our goodwill existed as of january  assumptions in estimating future cash flows are subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity 
we make every effort to forecast these future cash flows as accurately as possible with the information available at the time the forecast is developed 
however  changes in the assumptions and estimates may affect the carrying value of goodwill  and could result in impairment charges in future periods 
factors that have the potential to create variances between forecasted cash flows and actual results include but are not limited to i fluctuations in sales volumes  ii long term growth in the number of stores  and iii actual gross margin results 
refer to forward looking statements included in the beginning of this form k for further information regarding the impact of estimates of future cash flows 
the calculation of fair value could increase or decrease depending on changes in the inputs and assumptions used  such as changes in the financial performance of the reporting unit  future growth rate  and discount rate 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test  we applied a hypothetical decrease in cash flows as a basis point reduction to our projected growth rate and a basis point increase in the discount rate which we considered appropriate 
based on the goodwill analysis performed as of january   the outlined changes in our assumptions would not affect the results of the impairment test  as the reporting unit still had an excess of fair value over the carrying value 
however  as we continue to face a challenging retail environment and general uncertainty in the global economy  the assumptions used in future calculations of fair value may change significantly which could result in impairment charges in future periods 
revenue recognition revenues from retail sales  net of discounts and excluding sales tax  are recognized at the time of sale 
guest returns have not been significant 
revenues from gift certificates are recognized at the time of redemption 
unredeemed gift cards are included in current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
we have a customer loyalty program in north america  the stuff fur stuff club  whereby guests enroll in the program and receive one point for every dollar or partial dollar spent and after reaching points receive a discount on a future purchase 
an estimate of the obligation related to the program  based on historical redemption patterns  is recorded as deferred revenue and a reduction of net retail sales 
the deferred revenue obligation is reduced  and a corresponding amount is recognized in net retail sales  in the amount of and at the time of redemption of the certificate 
throughout fiscal  we continued to use the deferral rate established at the end of fiscal to estimate the appropriate amount of revenue to defer and thereby the related liability 
this rate  which was based on actual redemption rates and historical results  was applied to eligible purchases of stuff fur stuff club members at the time of the transaction 
during  we experienced a change in members redemption patterns as our members began utilizing other discounts and coupons available to them in place of an issued reward certificate 
accordingly  at the end of fiscal  we reevaluated the available data to determine the most accurate approach to estimate our liability and deferral of revenue  including the use of historical point conversion and certificate redemption patterns 
as of the january  balance sheet  we used historical point conversion and redemption patterns to estimate our liability under the loyalty program 
we apply the historical rates for points converting into certificates and ultimate certificate redemption to our actual points and certificates outstanding at each balance sheet date to calculate the liability and corresponding adjustment to net retail sales 
based on this assessment at the end of fiscal  the deferred revenue liability was adjusted downward by million  with a corresponding increase to net retail sales  and a million increase in net income 
we review these patterns and assess the adequacy of the deferred revenue liability at the end of each fiscal quarter 
due to the estimates involved in these assessments  adjustments to the historical rates are generally made no more often than annually in order to allow time for more definite trends to emerge 
the calculation of fair value could increase or decrease depending on changes in the inputs and assumptions used  specifically  expected conversion and redemption rates 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimates used in the recognition of deferred revenue  we applied a hypothetical increase of bps in the conversion and redemption rates which we believe is appropriate 
based on the analysis performed as of january   the change in our assumptions would have resulted in a million reduction of net retail sales 
based on the assessment at the end of fiscal  no adjustment was made to the deferral rate 
based on the assessment at the end of fiscal  the deferred revenue liability was adjusted downward by million  effective at the beginning of fiscal  with a corresponding increase to net retail sales  and a million increase in net income 
additionally  the amount of revenue being deferred for future periods was decreased by bps to give effect to the change in redemption experience and the increased visibility of the redemptions 
income taxes our income tax expense is based on our income  statutory tax rates  and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities 
significant judgment is required in determining our income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions  including evaluating uncertainties 
management reviews tax positions at least quarterly and adjusts the balances as new information becomes available 
deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years 
such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
management evaluates the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources  including reversal of taxable temporary differences  forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies 
these estimates of future taxable income inherently require significant judgment 
management uses historical experience and short and long range business forecasts to develop such estimates 
further  we employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions 
to the extent management does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered  a valuation allowance is established 
recent accounting pronouncements there are no recently issued but not yet adopted accounting pronouncements that are expected to significantly impact our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates  and we bear this risk in two specific ways 
first  our revolving credit facility carries a variable interest rate that is tied to market indices and  therefore  our results of operations and our cash flows can be impacted by changes in interest rates 
outstanding balances under our credit facility bear interest at libor plus 
we had no borrowings during fiscal accordingly  a basis point change in interest rates would result in no material change to our annual interest expense 
the second component of interest rate risk involves the short term investment of excess cash in short term  investment grade interest bearing securities 
these investments are considered to be cash equivalents and are shown that way on our balance sheet 
if there are changes in interest rates  those changes would affect the investment income we earn on these investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
we conduct operations in various countries  which expose us to changes in foreign exchange rates 
the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries and franchisees may be materially impacted by exposure to fluctuating exchange rates 
reported sales  costs and expenses at our foreign subsidiaries  when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes  can fluctuate due to exchange rate movement 
while exchange rate fluctuations can have a material impact on reported revenues  costs and expenses  and earnings  this impact is principally the result of the translation effect and does not materially impact our short term cash flows 
although we enter into a significant amount of purchase obligations outside of the us  these obligations are settled primarily in us dollars and  therefore  we believe we have only minimal exposure at present to foreign currency exchange risks for our purchase obligations 
historically  we have not hedged our currency risk and do not currently anticipate doing so in the future 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes
