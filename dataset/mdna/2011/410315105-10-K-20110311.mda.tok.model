item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information 
the company continues to apply the hnh business system at all of its business units 
the hnh business system is at the heart of the operational improvement methodologies for all hnh companies and employees 
strategy deployment forms the roof of the hnh business system and serves to convert strategic plans into tangible actions ensuring alignment of goals throughout each of our businesses 
the pillars of the hnh business system are the key performance indicators used to monitor and drive improvement 
the steps of the hnh business system are the specific tool areas that drive the key performance indicators and overall performance 
hnh utilizes lean tools and philosophies to reduce and eliminate waste coupled with the six sigma tools targeted at variation reduction 
the hnh business system is a proven  holistic approach to increasing shareholder value and achieving long term  sustainable  and profitable growth 
the company is supporting profitable sales growth both internally and potentially through acquisitions 
the company continues to examine all of its options and strategies  including acquisitions  divestitures  and other corporate transactions  to increase cash flow and stockholder value 
in and  the company engaged in various restructuring activities that management believes will result in a more efficient infrastructure that can be leveraged in the future 
these activities included consolidation of the bairnco corporate office into the hnh corporate office  the closure of facilities in atlanta in and new hampshire and dallas in and relocation of the functions to other existing facilities 
in connection with these activities  restructuring charges totaled million in and million in the company decided to exit various businesses  including that of the arlon cm segment in in and  the company exited the welded specialty tubing market in europe by closing its itd subsidiary and the precious metal electroplating business of its sumco subsidiary 
the company filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec which was declared effective on june  pursuant to this statement  the company may  from time to time  issue up to million of its common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  warrants to purchase common stock  preferred stock  or debt securities  or any combination of the above  separately or as units 
the terms of any offerings under the shelf registration statement would be determined at the time of the offering 
the company does not presently have any definitive plans or current commitments to sell securities that may be registered under the shelf registration statement 
however  management believes that the shelf registration statement provides the company with the flexibility to quickly raise capital in the market as conditions permit with a minimum of administrative preparation and expense 
the net proceeds of any such issuances under the shelf registration statement could be used for general corporate purposes  which may include working capital and or capital expenditures 

table of contents in view of the matters described in the preceding paragraphs  management believes that the company has the ability to meet its cash requirements on a continuing basis for at least the next twelve months 
however  if the company s planned cash flow projections are not met and or credit is not available in sufficient amounts  management could consider the additional reduction of certain discretionary expenses and sale of certain assets 
in the event that these plans are not sufficient and or the company s credit facilities are not adequate  the company s ability to operate could be materially adversely affected and could raise substantial doubt that the company will be able to continue to operate 
when used in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the words anticipate  estimate and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act  which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby 
investors are cautioned that all forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainty  including without limitation  general economic conditions  the ability of the company to develop markets and sell its products  and the effects of competition and pricing 
although the company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward looking statements are reasonable  any of the assumptions could be inaccurate  and therefore  there can be no assurance that the forward looking statements included herein will prove to be accurate 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  long lived assets  intangibles  accrued expenses  income taxes  pensions and other post retirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
estimates are based on historical experience  future cash flows and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
gaap requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note to the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this form k  includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company s financial statements 
the following is a discussion of the critical accounting policies and methods used by the company 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the lifo method for precious metal inventories 
non precious metal inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined by the first in  first out fifo method or average cost or market 
for precious metal inventories  no segregation among raw materials  work in process and finished goods is practicable 
non precious metal inventory is evaluated for estimated excess and obsolescence based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions and is adjusted accordingly 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  write downs may be required 
derivatives h h enters into commodity futures and forwards contracts on precious metal that are subject to market fluctuations in order to economically hedge its precious metal inventory against price fluctuations 
future and forward contracts to sell or buy precious metal are the derivatives used for this objective 
as these derivatives are not designated as accounting hedges under gaap  they are accounted for as derivatives with no hedge designation 
these derivatives are marked to market and both realized and unrealized gains and losses on these derivatives are recorded in current period earnings as other income loss 
the unrealized gain or loss open trade equity on the derivatives is included in other current assets or other current liabilities  respectively 

table of contents as of december  and  the company had contracted for million and million  respectively  of forward contracts with a counter party rated a by standard poors  and the future contracts are exchange traded contracts through a third party broker 
accordingly  the company has determined that there is minimal credit risk of default 
the company estimates the fair value of its derivative contracts through use of market quotes or broker valuations when market information is not available 
goodwill  other intangibles and long lived assets goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination 
goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment in accordance with gaap 
the company uses judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment tests 
circumstances that could trigger an interim impairment test include but are not limited to the occurrence of a significant change in circumstances  such as continuing adverse business conditions or legal factors  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  the likelihood that a reporting unit or significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed  or results of testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit 
the testing of goodwill for impairment is performed at a level referred to as a reporting unit 
goodwill is allocated to each reporting unit based on actual goodwill valued in connection with each business combination consummated within each reporting unit 
six reporting units of the company have goodwill assigned to them 
goodwill impairment testing consists of a two step process 
step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their carrying values  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to determine the amount of impairment loss 
step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill against the carrying value of that goodwill 
in performing the first step of the impairment test  the company also reconciles the aggregate estimated fair value of its reporting units to its enterprise value which includes a control premium 
to estimate the fair value of our reporting units  we considered an income approach and a market approach 
the income approach is based on a discounted cash flow analysis dcf and calculates the fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting the after tax cash flows to a present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
assumptions used in the dcf require the exercise of significant judgment  including judgment about appropriate discount rates and terminal values  growth rates  and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows 
the forecasted cash flows are based on current plans and for years beyond that plan  the estimates are based on assumed growth rates 
we believe the assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses 
the discount rates  which are intended to reflect the risks inherent in future cash flow projections  used in the dcf are based on estimates of the weighted average cost of capital wacc of a market participant 
such estimates are derived from our analysis of peer companies and considered the industry weighted average return on debt and equity from a market participant perspective 
the company believes the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our respective reporting units are reasonable 
if different assumptions were used  particularly with respect to forecasted cash flows or waccs  different estimates of fair value may result and there could be the potential that an impairment charge could result 
actual operating results and the related cash flows of the reporting units could differ from the estimated operating results and related cash flows 
the recoverability of goodwill may be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are not achieved 
a market approach values a business by considering the prices at which shares of capital stock of reasonably comparable companies are trading in the public market  or the transaction price at which similar companies have been acquired 
if comparable companies are not available  the market approach is not used 
relative weights are then given to the results of each of these approaches  based on the facts and circumstances of the business being valued 
the use of multiple approaches income and market approaches is considered preferable to a single method 
in our case  full weight is given to the income approach because it generally provides a reliable estimate of value for an ongoing business which has a reliable forecast of operations  and suitable comparable public companies were not available to be used under the market approach 
the income approach closely parallels investors consideration of the future benefits derived from ownership of an asset 

table of contents intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we also estimate the depreciable lives of property  plant and equipment  and review the assets for impairment if events  or changes in circumstances  indicate that we may not recover the carrying amount of an asset 
long lived assets consisting of land and buildings used in previously operating businesses are carried at the lower of cost or fair value  and are included in other non current assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
a reduction in the carrying value of such long lived assets used in previously operating businesses is recorded as an impairment charge in the consolidated statement of operations 
pension and postretirement benefit costs the company maintains several qualified and non qualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans 
pension benefits are generally based on years of service and the amount of compensation at the time of retirement 
however  the qualified pension benefits have been frozen for most participants 
the company s pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates and expected long term rates of return on plan assets 
material changes in the company s pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions  changes in the number of plan participants  changes in the level of benefits provided  changes to the level of contributions to these plans and other factors 
the company determines its actuarial assumptions for its pension and postretirement plans on december of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension and postretirement expense for the following year 
the discount rate assumption is derived from the rate of return on high quality bonds as of december of each year 
the whx pension plan s assets are diversified as to type of assets  investment strategies employed  and number of investment managers used 
investments may include equities  fixed income  cash equivalents  convertible securities  insurance contracts  and private investment funds 
derivatives may be used as part of the investment strategy 
the company may direct the transfer of assets between investment managers in order to rebalance the portfolio in accordance with asset allocation guidelines established by the company 
the private investment funds or the investment funds they are invested in  own marketable and non marketable securities and other investment instruments 
such investments are valued by the private investment funds  underlying investment managers or the underlying investment funds  at fair value  as described in their respective financial statements and offering memorandums 
the company utilizes these values in quantifying the value of the assets of its pension plans  which is then used in the determination of the unfunded pension liability on the balance sheet 
because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation of some of the pension plans investments in private investment funds and some of the underlying investments held by the investment funds  the recorded value may differ from the value that would have been used had a ready market existed for some of these investments for which market quotations are not readily available and are valued at their fair value as determined in good faith by the respective private investment funds  underlying investment managers  or the underlying investment funds 
management uses judgment to make assumptions on which its employee benefit liabilities and expenses are based 
the effect of a change in two key assumptions for the whx pension plan is summarized as follows assumptions statement of operations balance sheet impact in millions discount rate increase decrease expected return on assets increase decrease estimated impact on net periodic benefit costs 
estimated impact on pension liability 

table of contents environmental remediation the company accrues for losses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable 
accruals for estimated losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study 
such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change 
costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value 
recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable 
as of december   total accruals for environmental remediation were million 
legal contingencies the company provides for legal contingencies when the liability is probable and the amount of the associated costs is reasonably determinable 
the company regularly monitors the progress of legal contingencies and revises the amounts recorded in the period in which changes in estimate occur 
new accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements and disclosures accounting standards codification asc  in order to provide a greater level of disaggregated information and more robust disclosures about valuation techniques and inputs to fair value measurements  as well as additional information about transfers between levels and activity during the reporting period 
it also includes conforming amendments to the guidance on employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets asc  so as to refer to asc to determine the appropriate classes to present fair value disclosures about such plan assets 
most of the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for the company s interim and annual reporting periods of  and the company adopted them in the first quarter of because the new requirements affect disclosures but do not change the accounting for any assets or liabilities  their adoption did not have an effect on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations
