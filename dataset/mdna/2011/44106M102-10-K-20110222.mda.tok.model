item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollar amounts in thousands  except per share amounts overview the following information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this annual report on form k 
recent developments us hotel industry 
the us hotel industry continues to feel the financial effects of the recent recession 
in both and  the us hotel industry generally experienced declines versus the previous year in occupancy  revenues and profitability 
although each of our hotel operators reported increases in occupancy during  the majority of our hotel properties continued to experience declines in average daily rate and higher operating expenses resulting in lower profitability at our hotels 
in  our hotel properties experienced a increase in revenue per available room  or revpar  and a decline in cash flow available to pay our minimum returns and rents compared to these results reflect increased business and leisure travel  but at reduced rates compared to prior years 
as of december   all returns and rent payments due to us under our hotel operating agreements were current except for the marriott no 
and no 
agreements discussed below 
our hotel operating agreements contain security features  such as guarantees and security deposits  which are intended to protect minimum contractual returns and rents due to us in accordance with our operating agreements regardless of hotel performance 
however  the effectiveness of various security features to provide uninterrupted receipt by us of minimum contractual rents and returns is not assured  particularly if the us economy and the lodging industry takes an extended period to recover from the severe declines experienced during the recent recession 
if our tenants  managers or guarantors default in their payment obligations to us  our cash flows will decline 
our hotel tenants and managers 
during the twelve months ended december   all payments due to us under our hotel leases and hotel management contracts were paid when due except for certain payments from marriott and crestline 
during the twelve months ended december   the payments we received under our marriott no 
contract that requires minimum annual payments to us of approximately  and under our marriott no 
contract that requires minimum annual rent payments to us of approximately  were  and  respectively  less than the minimum amounts contractually required 
we applied available security deposits to cover these deficiencies 
also  during the period between december  and february   we did not receive payments to cure shortfalls for the marriott no 
and marriott no 
contracts of  and  respectively  and we applied security deposits we hold to cover these amounts 
at february   the remaining balances of the security deposits which we hold for the marriott no 
and marriott no 
contracts were  and  respectively 
at this time  we expect that marriott will continue to pay us the net cash flows from operations of the hotels included in the defaulted contracts 
in the absence of any agreements modifying the contract terms between us and marriott and crestline  we currently expect that the security deposits we hold from marriott and crestline may be fully utilized to cover cash shortfalls in payments we expect to receive under these contracts during we have entered into negotiations with marriott to modify our agreements covering these hotels and the management agreement covering residence inn hotels which we have historically referred to as our marriott no 
agreement 
although we intend to pursue these negotiations  there can be no assurance that any agreement will be reached 
as of december   the remaining availability under the  guarantee securing intercontinental obligations under its four operating agreements with us had been reduced to  in january  the guarantee became fully exhausted 
on february   the payments we received under our four operating agreements with intercontinental  which require annual minimum returns rents of  were  less than the minimum amounts contractually required 
we applied the available security deposit to cover these shortfalls 
at february   the remaining balance of the security deposit we hold for these intercontinental agreements was  at this time  we expect that intercontinental will continue to pay us the net cash flows from operations of the hotels included in the defaulted contracts 
in the absence of an agreement modifying the terms of our agreements with intercontinental  we believe the security deposit we hold from intercontinental may approximate the shortfall of the payments we expect to receive compared to the minimum payments due to us under these contracts 
we have entered into negotiations with intercontinental to modify our four operating agreements covering hotels 
during these negotiations  we entered into an agreement with intercontinental on january   providing that the security deposit we hold will secure intercontinental obligations under all four of our operating agreements with them  previously  the security deposit secured intercontinental obligations under three of the agreements 
although we intend to pursue further negotiations with intercontinental  there can be no assurance that any further agreement will be reached 
when we reduce the amounts of the security deposits we hold for these agreements or any other operating agreements for payment deficiencies  we record income equal to the amounts by which these deposits are reduced up to the contractual minimum return or rent due to us and reducing amounts of security deposits does reduce the refunds due to the respective lessees or managers who have provided us with these deposits 
however  these deposits are not escrowed and reducing the security deposits does not result in cash flow to us of the deficiency amounts 
under all of our hotel contracts that include a security deposit  any amount of the security deposit which is applied to payment deficits may be replenished from future cash flows under the respective contracts 
in connection with our ongoing negotiations with both marriott and intercontinental regarding modified agreements  we are considering selling hotels 
as a result  in performing our periodic evaluation of real estate assets for impairment during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a loss on asset impairment to reduce the carrying value of of these hotels to their estimated fair value 
as previously noted  discussions with marriott and intercontinental are ongoing  and there can be no assurance that any modified agreements will be reached or that we will decide to sell any or all of these hotels 
ta amendment agreement 
on january   we entered into an amendment agreement with ta which modified the terms of our two leases with ta 
the amended terms are as follows our lease for travel centers which we have historically referred to as ta no 
was modified effective january   so that the minimum rent is reduced from  per year to  per year 
the rent will increase to  per year effective february   plus increases beginning in based upon percentages of increases in gross revenues which exceed a threshold amount 
our lease for travel centers which we have historically referred to as ta no 
was modified effective january   so that the minimum rent is reduced from  per year to  per year  plus increases starting in based upon percentages of increases in gross revenues that exceed a threshold amount  and the first  of percentage rent shall be waived provided the settlement of certain litigation pending against us  ta and others is approved by the delaware court of chancery 
the  of previously deferred rent due from ta to us is further deferred  without interest  so that  will be due in december and  will be due in june these deferred rent amounts will become due and interest may accrue in certain circumstances set forth in the amendment agreement  including a change in control of ta 
ta was formerly our owned subsidiary and it became a public company in a spin off transaction in rmr provides certain management services to both us and ta 
for more information on our relationship with ta  please see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources related person transactions 
management agreements and leases at december   our hotels were included in one of eleven agreements  of which were leased to one of our wholly owned trss and managed by an independent hotel operating company and were leased to third parties 
our lease with a third party for hotels expired on december  on january   we began leasing the hotels to one of our trss and continued the previously existing brand and hotel management agreement 
our travel centers are leased to ta under two agreements 
our consolidated statements of income include operating revenues and expenses of our managed hotels and rental income from our leased hotels and travel centers

revenues at most of our managed hotels increased from due to higher occupancy rates  partially offset by declines in adr at certain of our hotels 
additional operating statistics of our hotels are included in the table on page the increase in minimum rents hotels is a result of our funding of improvements at certain of our leased hotels in and that resulted in increases in the annual minimum rents due to us 
the increase in rental income travel centers is a result of contractual rent increases in our lease agreement with ta for travel centers and interest of  earned on deferred rent amounts in rental income for both periods excludes  of rent deferred by ta under our rent deferral agreement with ta discussed below in related person transactions 
the increase in percentage rent hotels is the result of increased sales compared to base year sales at certain of our leased hotels 
ff e reserve income hotels represents amounts paid by certain of our hotel tenants into restricted accounts owned by us  the purpose of which is to accumulate funds for future capital expenditures 
the terms of our hotel leases require these amounts to be calculated as a percentage of total sales at our hotels 
the increase in ff e reserve income is primarily due to increases in the percentage of sales contributed to our ff e reserves by some of our tenants in and increased levels of hotel sales in versus at our leased hotels 
we do not report the amounts which are escrowed as ff e reserves for our managed hotels as ff e reserve income 
the increase in hotel operating expenses was primarily caused by increased expenses associated with higher occupancy at our managed hotels  partially offset by the funding by certain of our managers of minimum return deficiencies and our application of a security deposit to cover minimum return deficiencies 
certain of our managed hotel portfolios had net operating results that were  in the aggregate   and  less than the minimum returns due to us in and  respectively 
we reflect these amounts in our consolidated statements of income as a reduction to hotel operating expense because the minimum returns were funded by the managers of these hotels under the terms of our operating agreements  or in the case of our marriott no 
agreement  applied from the security deposit we hold 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization hotels is primarily due to fully depreciated improvements that were retired  partially offset by the depreciation and amortization of assets acquired with funds from ff e reserve accounts owned by us or separately funded by us in and the decrease in depreciation and amortization travel centers is primarily due to fully depreciated improvements that were retired  partially offset by the depreciation and amortization of improvements made to our travel centers during and the decrease in general and administrative expense is due primarily to lower professional services fees in versus the increase in operating income is primarily due to the revenue and expense changes discussed above 
the increase in interest income is due to higher average restricted cash balances during versus the decrease in interest expense is primarily due to lower average borrowings  partially offset by higher weighted average interest rates during than in during the second quarter of  we recorded a  loss on the extinguishment of debt relating to the purchase of  face amount of our convertible senior notes due for an aggregate purchase price of  excluding accrued interest 
the loss on extinguishment of debt includes unamortized issuance costs and discounts of  of transaction costs  net of  representing the equity component of the notes 
the gain on extinguishment of debt in resulted from our purchase of  face amount of our convertible senior notes due and various issues of our senior notes for an aggregate purchase price of  excluding accrued interest 
the gain on extinguishment of debt is net of unamortized issuance costs and discounts of  and includes a portion of the allocated equity component on the convertible notes of  in connection with our decision to pursue the sale of our crowne plaza hotels in hilton head  sc and dallas  tx and our holiday inn hotel in memphis  tn  we recorded a  or per share  loss on asset impairment in the second quarter of to reduce the carrying value of these hotels to their estimated fair value less costs to sell 
our staybridge suites hotel in dallas  tx is also being offered for sale but we estimated the fair value less costs to sell of this hotel was greater than its carrying value 
in performing our periodic evaluation of real estate assets for impairment during the fourth quarter of  we revised our assumptions regarding our expected ownership period for of our hotels because we are considering selling these hotels as part of our negotiations with both marriott and intercontinental 
as a result of this change  we recorded a  or per share  loss on asset impairment in the fourth quarter of to reduce the carrying value of of these hotels to their estimated fair value 
in the fourth quarter of  we also recorded a  or per share  valuation adjustment to increase the estimated fair value of our four hotels held for sale 
the net loss on asset impairment for the twelve months ended december  was  or per share 
equity in losses of equity investments represents our proportionate share of earnings losses of aic 
the decrease in income tax expense is primarily the result of lower state income taxes due to a decrease in taxable income for state income tax purposes as a result of our increased common share distributions in compared to the period 
the decreases in net income  net loss available for common shareholders and net loss available for common shareholders per common share are primarily due to the investment  operating and financing activities discussed above

additional operating statistics of our hotels are included in the table on page the increase in minimum rents hotels is a result of our funding of improvements at certain of our leased hotels in and that resulted in increases in the annual minimum rents due to us 
the decrease in minimum rents travel centers is a result of the deferral of  of rent by ta in versus  in under the terms of our rent deferral agreement with ta  partially offset by contractual rent increases in our lease agreement with ta for travel centers 
the decrease in percentage rent hotels is the result of decreased sales compared to base year sales at our leased hotels 
the decrease in ff e reserve income hotels is primarily due to decreased levels of hotel sales in versus at our leased hotels 
we do not report the amounts which are escrowed as ff e reserves for our managed hotels as ff e reserve income 
the decrease in hotel operating expenses was primarily caused by the decline in occupancy at our managed hotels  manager initiatives to lower expenses  the reduction in expenses such as marketing and reservation fees which are based on revenues and the funding by certain of our managers of minimum return deficiencies and our application of a security deposit to cover a minimum return deficiency 
certain of our managed hotels had net operating results that were  less than the minimum returns due to us in we reflected these amounts in our consolidated statement of income as a reduction to hotel operating expenses because the minimum returns were funded by the managers of these hotels under the terms of our operating agreements  or in the case of our marriott no 
agreement  applied from the security deposit we hold 
all of our managed hotels generated net operating results above the minimum returns due to us in the increase in depreciation and amortization hotels is due primarily to the depreciation and amortization of assets acquired with funds from ff e reserve accounts owned by us in and the decrease in depreciation and amortization travel centers is due primarily to fully depreciated improvements that were retired during partially offset by depreciation and amortization of improvements made to our travel centers during and the increase in general and administrative expense is due primarily to higher professional services fees in the decrease in operating income is primarily due to the revenue and expense changes discussed above the decrease in interest income is due to lower average interest rates during the decrease in interest expense is primarily due to lower average borrowings  partially offset by slightly higher weighted average interest rates during than in the gain on extinguishment of debt in resulted from our purchase of  face amount of our convertible senior notes and various issues of our senior notes for an aggregate purchase price of  excluding accrued interest 
we recorded a  loss on asset impairment in the second quarter of to reduce the carrying value of certain intangible assets arising from our january ta acquisition to their estimated fair market value 
equity in losses of equity investments represents our proportionate share of losses of aic 
the net gain on sale of real estate in reflects the sale of our park plaza hotel in north phoenix  arizona for a gain of during the first quarter of  our amerisuites hotel in atlantic beach  north carolina for a gain of in the second quarter of  and our amerisuites hotel in tampa  florida for a loss of  during the fourth quarter of we recorded a  reserve in the second quarter of to fully reserve the straight line rent receivable relating to our lease with ta for travel centers 
the increase in income tax expense is primarily the result of higher state income taxes due to an increase in taxable income for state income tax purposes as a result of our lower common share distributions in the increases in net income  net income available for common shareholders and net income available for common shareholders per common share are primarily due to the investment  operating and financing activities discussed above 
on a per share basis  the percentage increase in net income available for common shareholders is lower due to the increase in our weighted average common shares outstanding due to our issuance of common shares in june and august of liquidity and capital resources dollar amounts in thousands  except per share amounts our managers and tenants all of our properties are operated under management agreements or leases 
all costs of operating and maintaining our properties are paid by the third party hotel managers as agents for us or by hotel or travel center tenants for their own account 
these managers and tenants derive their funding for property operating expenses  ff e reserve  and returns and rents due to us generally from property operating revenues and  to the extent that these managers and tenants fund our minimum returns and minimum rents  from their separate resources 
we define coverage for each of our management agreements or leases as total property sales minus all property level expenses that are not subordinated to the minimum returns and minimum rents due to us and the required ff e reserve contributions  divided by the aggregate minimum payments due to us 
more detail regarding coverage  guarantees and other security features of our operating agreements is presented in the tables on pages and during the twelve months ended december   all of our hotel operating agreements  generated coverage of less than x x to x 
we define coverage for each of our travel center leases as total property level sales minus all property level expenses divided by the minimum rents due to us 
during the twelve months ended december   our two travel center leases  representing properties  generated coverage of x and x  respectively 
effective july   we entered into a rent deferral agreement with ta  the tenant under our two travel center leases 
however  we calculated the rent coverage ratios for the twelve months ended december  using the contractual rent amounts without consideration of the rent deferral 
because substantially all of ta business is conducted at properties leased from us  property level rent coverage may not be an appropriate way to evaluate ta ability to pay rents due to us 
we believe property level rent coverage is nonetheless one useful indicator of the performance and value of our properties as we believe it is what an operator interested in acquiring these properties or the leaseholds might use to evaluate these properties contributions to their earnings before corporate level expenses 
three hundred fifty of our properties  representing of our total historical investments at cost as of december  are operated under nine management arrangements or leases which are subject to full or limited guarantees 
these guarantees may provide us with continued payments if the total sales less total expenses and required hotel ff e reserve payments fail to equal or exceed guaranteed amounts due to us 
some of our managers and tenants or their affiliates may also supplement cash flow from our properties in order to make payments to us and preserve their rights to continue operating our properties even if they are not required to do so by guarantees 
guarantee or supplemental payments to us  if any  made under any of our management agreements or leases  do not subject us to repayment obligations but  under some of our agreements  these guarantee or supplemental payments may be recovered by the manager  tenant or guarantor from the future cash flows from our properties after our future minimum returns and minimum rents are paid 
as described above  marriott and crestline have failed to pay the full minimum return or rent amounts due to us under the marriott no 
and marriott no 
agreements  respectively 
the intercontinental guarantee has been exhausted  and intercontinental has failed to pay the full minimum return or rent due to us under four agreements 
as of february   all other payments due from our managers and tenants are current 
however several of the guarantees and all the security deposits we hold are for limited amounts and may be exhausted  especially if the us economy does not fully recover from the recent recession in a reasonable time period 
accordingly  the effectiveness of our various security features to provide uninterrupted payments to us is not assured 
if any of our property operators  tenants or guarantors default in their payment obligations to us  our cash flows will decline 
our operating liquidity and capital resources our principal source of funds for current expenses and distributions to shareholders are minimum returns from our managed hotels and minimum rents from our leased hotels and travel centers 
we receive minimum returns and minimum rents from our managers and tenants monthly 
we receive additional returns  percentage returns and rents and our share of the operating profits of our managed hotels after payment of management fees and other deductions either monthly or quarterly 
this flow of funds has historically been sufficient for us to pay our operating expenses  debt service interest and distributions to shareholders declared by our board of trustees 
we believe that our operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses  interest and distribution payments declared by our board of trustees for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future after the next twelve months 
however  because of the impact of the weak us economy on the hotel and travel center industries  our operators and tenants may be unable to pay minimum returns and minimum rents to us when due  in which case our cash flow and net income will decline and we may need to reduce the amount of  or even eliminate  our distributions to common shareholders 
our changes in cash flows during the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period in was as follows cash flow provided by operating activities increased from  in to  in  cash used in investment activities increased from  in to  in  and cash used in financing activities increased from  in to  in the increase in cash provided by operating activities between and is due primarily to increases in rental income received under our lease agreements and favorable changes in working capital 
the increase in investment activities is primarily due to higher amounts of ff e reserve fundings in the period compared to and the refund of a security deposit upon the expiration of a lease in the net increase in cash used in financing activities between and is primarily a result of an increase in common share distributions in  partially offset by our issuance of common shares and senior notes in and lower debt repayments in we maintain our status as a reit under the irc by meeting certain requirements 
as a reit  we do not expect to pay federal income taxes on the majority of our income 
the irc  among other things  allows a reit to lease hotels to trss if the hotels are managed by an independent third party 
the income realized by our trss in excess of the rent they pay to us is subject to income tax at corporate tax rates 
the income we receive from our hotels in canada and puerto rico is subject to taxes in those jurisdictions and we are subject to taxes in certain states where our properties are located 
our investment and financing liquidity and capital resources various percentages of total sales at most of our hotels are escrowed as ff e reserves to fund future capital improvements 
during the twelve months ended december   our hotel managers and hotel tenants contributed  to these accounts and spent  from the ff e reserve escrow accounts and from our payments to renovate and refurbish our hotels 
as of december   there was  on deposit in these escrow accounts  which was held by us and is reflected on our balance sheet as restricted cash 
our hotel operating agreements generally provide that  if necessary  we will provide our managers and tenants with funding for capital improvements to our hotels in excess of amounts otherwise available in escrowed ff e reserves 
to the extent we make such additional fundings  our annual minimum returns or minimum rents generally increase by a percentage of the amount we fund 
during the twelve months ended december   we funded  for capital improvements in excess of ff e reserve fundings available from hotel operations to our hotels included in our marriott no 
and no 
agreements using cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we expect to fund approximately  for improvements to these marriott hotels during using our existing cash balances or borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
as described above  we have entered into negotiations with marriott and intercontinental to modify certain of our hotel operating agreements 
these negotiations may result in our agreement to fund certain capital improvements to the hotels included in these agreements 
our lease with a subsidiary of host for residence inn hotels which we have historically referred to as our marriott no 
contract expired on december  as required upon expiration of the agreement  we refunded the  security deposit to host using borrowings under our revolving credit facility and existing cash balances 
in november  host notified us that it will not exercise its renewal option at the end of the current lease term for courtyard hotels which we have historically referred to as our marriott no 
contract 
assuming that host does not default its contractual obligations to us  upon expiration of this agreement on december   we will be required to return the  security deposit to host 
we expect to fund the return of this security deposit using existing cash balances or borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our travel center leases with ta do not require ff e escrow deposits 
however  ta is required to maintain the leased travel centers  including structural and non structural components 
in may  we entered into an amendment to our lease with ta for travel centers 
the historical lease provided for our purchase of a total of  of specified capital improvements to the leased travel centers during the first five years of the lease term  and that these purchases were limited to  per year 
the amendment provided that ta may accelerate our purchase of the specified capital improvements 
in the event that ta sold us capital improvements before the time contractually required by the original lease terms  our purchase commitment amount was discounted to reflect the accelerated disbursement of funds by us according to a present value formula established in the amended lease 
as of december   we have funded  and have fulfilled our purchase commitment under this lease 
under both our leases with ta  ta may request that we fund additional amounts for capital improvements to the leased facilities in return for minimum rent increases  however  we made no fundings under such lease provisions during the twelve months ended december  on january   april   july  and october   we paid a per share distribution to our series b preferred shareholders with respect to the periods ended january   april   july  and october   respectively 
on december   we declared a per share distribution to series b preferred shareholders of record on december  with respect to the period ended january  we paid this distribution on january  we funded these distributions using existing cash balances and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
on february   may   august  and november  we paid a per share distribution to our series c preferred shareholders with respect to the periods ended february   may   august  and november  on january   we declared a distribution of per series c preferred shareholders with respect to the period ending february  we paid this distribution on february  we funded these distributions using existing cash balances and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
on february   may   august  and november   we paid a per share distribution to our common shareholders 
we funded these distributions using existing cash balances and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
on january   we declared a per share distribution to our common shareholders of record on january  we expect to pay this distribution on february  using existing cash balances and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
during the twelve months ended december   we purchased an aggregate of  of our convertible senior notes at a total cost of  excluding accrued interest  and recognized a  loss on extinguishment of debt 
the loss on extinguishment of debt includes unamortized issuance costs and discounts of  of transaction costs  net of  representing the equity component of the notes 
we made these purchases using existing cash balances and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
on july   we redeemed at par plus accrued interest  of our senior notes using borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in order to fund capital improvements to our properties and acquisitions and to meet cash needs that may result from timing differences between our receipt of returns and rents and our desire or need to make distributions or pay operating expenses  we maintain a revolving credit facility with a group of institutional lenders 
in september  we exercised our option to extend the maturity date of our revolving credit facility by one year to october   and we have since paid a  extension fee 
the annual interest rate payable for drawn amounts under the facility is libor plus a spread and was as of december  we may borrow up to  under the revolving credit facility 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility are unsecured 
we may draw  repay and redraw funds until maturity  and no principal repayment is due until maturity 
as of december   we had  outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
our term debt maturities other than our revolving credit facility are as follows  in   in   in   in   in   in   in  and  in our  of convertible senior notes due in are convertible  if certain conditions are met including certain changes in control  into cash equal to the principal amount of the notes and  to the extent the market price of our common shares exceeds the exchange price of per share  subject to adjustment  either cash or our common shares at our option  with a value based on such excess amount 
holders of our convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes on march   march  and march   or upon the occurrence of certain change in control events 
as of december   we had one mortgage note with a current principal balance of  that we assumed in connection with our acquisition of a hotel 
on january   we repaid without penalty the remaining principal balance of this mortgage  plus accrued interest using existing cash balances 
none of our other debt obligations require principal or sinking fund payments prior to their respective maturity dates 
at december   we had  of cash excluding ff e restricted cash and cash equivalents and  available under our revolving credit facility 
we expect to use existing cash balances  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and net proceeds of offerings of equity or debt securities to fund future property acquisitions and for other general business purposes 
when amounts are outstanding under our revolving credit facility and as the maturity dates of our revolving credit facility and term debts approach  we will explore alternatives for the repayment of amounts due 
such alternatives in the short term and long term may include incurring additional debt and issuing new equity securities 
we have an effective shelf registration statement that allows us to issue public securities on an expedited basis  but does not assure that there will be buyers for such securities 
our revolving credit facility matures on october  if we are able to renew our revolving credit facility  one or more financial institutions which now participate may choose not to participate in the renewal  we may be unable to find replacement lenders and our access to borrowing under the renewed facility could be reduced 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to renew our revolving credit facility or that  if renewed  we will be able to maintain its current size 
also  in current market conditions  we expect the interest and other charges we may have to pay when we renew our revolving credit facility will increase and that these increases may be material 
although capital market conditions have recently improved  the availability and cost of credit continue to be volatile  and credit availability for companies in the hotel and hospitality industry remains tight 
in october  a credit rating agency lowered our corporate credit  senior unsecured debt and preferred securities ratings and our credit ratings are on negative outlook with another credit agency 
while we believe we will have access to various types of financings  including debt or equity  to fund our future acquisitions and to pay our debts and other obligations  there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any debt or equity offerings or that our cost of any future public or private financings will be reasonable 
also  the downgrade of our credit ratings may result in increased interest costs when we renew our revolving credit facility or refinance our other debts  and these interest cost increases could have a material and adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
as of december   our contractual obligations were as follows dollars in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations ground lease obligations security deposits capital improvements projected interest expense total holders of our convertible senior notes  due in may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes on march   march  and march   or upon the occurrence of certain change in control events prior to march  the amounts in the table reflect these notes as being due in march when we expect to be required to repurchase them by their holders and therefore are included in the years category 
of our hotels and of our travel centers are on land leased partially or in its entirety 
in each case the ground lessors are unrelated to us 
generally  payments of ground lease obligations are made by our managers or tenants 
however  if a manager or tenant fails to perform obligations under a ground lease or elects not to renew any ground lease  we might have to perform obligations under the ground lease or renew the ground lease in order to protect our investment in the affected hotel or travel center 
represents the security deposit balance as of december  we may draw upon security deposits to cover any rent or return shortfalls thereby decreasing the potential obligation to repay some of these deposits 
represents amounts we have agreed to fund for capital improvements to our hotels in excess of amounts available in ff e reserves 
projected interest expense is interest attributable to only the long term debt obligations listed above at existing rates and is not intended to project future interest costs which may result from debt prepayments  new debt issuances or changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements  commercial paper  derivatives  swaps  hedges  guarantees  joint ventures or partnerships 
as of december   our secured debt obligations were limited to one mortgage note of  secured by a single property  which was subsequently prepaid in january none of our debt documentation requires us to provide collateral security in the event of a ratings downgrade 
debt covenants our debt obligations at december  consisted of our revolving credit facility  our  of unsecured term debt and convertible notes and our  mortgage note which we repaid in january 
our unsecured term debt and convertible notes are governed by an indenture 
this indenture and related supplements and our revolving credit facility agreement contain a number of financial ratio covenants which generally restrict our ability to incur debts  including debts secured by mortgages on our properties  in excess of calculated amounts  require us to maintain a minimum net worth  restrict our ability to make distributions under certain circumstances and require us to maintain various financial ratios 
as of december   we believe we were in compliance with all of our covenants under our indenture and its supplements and our revolving credit facility agreement 
neither our indenture and its supplements nor our revolving credit facility contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings 
however  under our revolving credit facility agreement  our senior debt ratings are used to determine the fees and interest rate applied to borrowings 
if our credit ratings are downgraded  our interest expense and related costs under our revolving credit facility would therefore increase 
our public debt indenture and its supplements contain cross default provisions with any other debts of  or more 
similarly  our revolving credit facility agreement has cross default provisions with other indebtedness that is recourse of  or more and indebtedness that is non recourse of  or more 
related person transactions we have adopted written governance guidelines which address  among other things  the consideration and approval of any related person transactions 
under these governance guidelines  we may not enter into any transaction in which any trustee or executive officer  any member of the immediate family of any trustee or executive officer or any other related person  has or will have a direct or indirect material interest unless that transaction has been disclosed or made known to our board of trustees and our board of trustees reviews  authorizes and approves or ratifies the transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested trustees  even if the disinterested trustees constitute less than a quorum 
if there are no disinterested trustees  the transaction shall be reviewed  authorized and approved or ratified by both the affirmative vote of a majority of our entire board of trustees and the affirmative vote of a majority of our independent trustees 
the governance guidelines further provide that  in determining whether to approve or ratify a transaction  our board of trustees  or disinterested trustees or independent trustees  as the case may be  shall act in accordance with any applicable provisions of our declaration of trust  consider all of the relevant facts and circumstances and approve only those transactions that are fair and reasonable to us 
all related person transactions described below were reviewed and approved or ratified by a majority of the disinterested trustees or otherwise in accordance with our policies described above 
in the case of transactions with us by rmr employees other than our trustees and executive officers subject to our code of business conduct and ethics  the employee must seek approval from an executive officer who has no interest in the matter for which approval is being requested 
we have two agreements with rmr to provide management and administrative services to us a business management agreement and a property management agreement 
one of our managing trustees  mr 
barry portnoy  is chairman and majority owner of rmr 
our other managing trustee  mr 
adam portnoy  the son of mr 
barry portnoy  is an owner  president  chief executive officer and a director of rmr 
each of our executive officers is also an officer of rmr  including mr 
ethan bornstein  who is the son in law of mr 
barry portnoy and the brother in law of mr 
adam portnoy 
rmr has approximately employees and provides management services to other companies in addition to us  and an affiliate of rmr is a registered investment advisor which manages two mutual funds 
our board of trustees has given our compensation committee  which is comprised exclusively of our independent trustees  authority to act with respect to our management agreements with rmr 
the charter of our compensation committee requires the committee annually to review the terms of these agreements  evaluate rmr performance under the agreements and approve  terminate or allow to expire the management agreements 
the business management agreement provides for compensation to rmr at an annual rate equal to of the average historical cost of our real estate investments  as described in the business management agreement  up to the first  of such investments  and thereafter 
in addition  rmr receives an incentive fee based upon increases in our cash available for distribution  as defined in the business management agreement 
the incentive fee is paid in our common shares 
at present  the property management agreement applies to management services to the office building component of only one property in baltimore  maryland which also includes an intercontinental hotel 
the property management agreement provides for management fees relating to this office building equal to of gross collected rents and construction supervision fees equal to of construction costs 
the aggregate business management and property management fees for  and were   and  respectively 
no incentive fees were earned by rmr in  or rmr also provides internal audit services to us in return for our pro rata share of the total internal audit costs incurred by rmr for us and other publicly owned companies managed by rmr and its affiliates  which amounts are subject to determination by our compensation committee 
our audit committee appoints our director of internal audit 
our pro rata share of rmr costs of providing this internal audit function was approximately  and for  and  respectively 
these allocated costs are in addition to the business management fees we paid to rmr 
we are generally responsible for all of our operating expenses  including certain expenses incurred by rmr on our behalf 
we are not responsible for payment of rmr employment  office or administration expenses incurred to provide management services to us  except for the employment and related expenses of rmr employees who provide on site property management services and our pro rata share of the staff employed by rmr who perform our internal audit function 
both the business management agreement and the property management agreement automatically renew for successive one year terms unless we or rmr give notice of non renewal before the end of an applicable term 
we or rmr may terminate either agreement upon days prior written notice 
rmr may also terminate the property management agreement upon five business days notice if we undergo a change of control  as defined in the property management agreement 
the current terms for these agreements expire on december   and will be subject to automatic renewal unless earlier terminated 
under our business management agreement with rmr  we acknowledge that rmr manages other businesses  including cwh  snh  gov  ta and five star  and will not be required to present us with opportunities to invest in properties that are primarily of a type that are within the investment focus of another business now or in the future managed by rmr 
under our business management agreement with rmr  rmr has also agreed not to provide business management services to any other reit which is principally engaged in the business of ownership of hotel or travel center properties without the consent of our independent trustees 
each of the business management agreement and the property management agreement also includes arbitration provisions for the resolution of certain disputes  claims and controversies 
pursuant to our business management agreement  rmr may from time to time negotiate on our behalf with third party vendors and suppliers for the procurement of services to us 
as part of this arrangement  we may enter agreements with rmr and other companies to which rmr provides management services for the purpose of obtaining more favorable terms from such vendors and suppliers 
as part of our annual restricted share grants under our share award plan  we typically grant restricted shares to certain employees of rmr  some of whom are our executive officers 
in  and  we granted a total of  restricted shares with an aggregate value of   common shares with an aggregate market value of  and  common shares with an aggregate market value of  respectively  to such persons  based upon the closing price of our common shares on the nyse on the date of grant 
one fifth of those restricted shares vested on the grant date and one fifth vests on each of the next four anniversaries of the grant date 
these share grants to rmr employees are in addition to the fees we pay to rmr 
ta was created as a subsidiary of ours 
on january   we purchased ta predecessor for approximately  simultaneously with this purchase  we restructured ta predecessor business as follows we retained the real estate of of the travel centers then operated or franchised by ta predecessor and certain other assets  ta predecessor operating business and all its assets not retained by us  plus approximately  of net working capital  were contributed to ta  ta entered a long term lease with us for its predecessor real estate retained by us  which we have historically referred to as the ta no 
lease  and all of ta shares were spun off to our shareholders on january  and ta became a separate public company 
as part of the rent deferral agreement described we acquired  and as of february   we continue to own   of ta common shares  which represented approximately of ta outstanding common shares 
mr 
barry portnoy  one of our managing trustees  is a managing director of ta 
mr 
thomas o brien  an officer of rmr and a former officer of us  is president and the other managing director of ta 
mr 
arthur koumantzelis  who was one of our independent trustees prior to the ta spin off  serves as an independent director of ta 
in addition to ta spin off from us on january   we completed another transaction together with ta in on may   ta purchased petro stopping centers  lp for  million and we purchased petro stopping centers holdings  lp for approximately  simultaneously with these purchases  ta leased petro travel centers from us pursuant to a lease  which we have historically referred to as the ta no 
lease 
ta has two leases with us  the ta no 
lease and the ta no 
lease  pursuant to which ta currently leases travel centers from us 
the ta no 
lease is for travel centers that ta operates under the travelcenters of america or ta brand names 
the ta no 
lease became effective on january  the ta no 
lease is for travel centers that ta operates under the petro brand name 
the ta no 
lease became effective on may  the ta no 
lease expires on december  the ta no 
lease expires on june   and may be extended by ta for up to two additional periods of years each 
both the ta no 
and ta no 
leases are triple net leases  which require ta to pay all costs incurred in the operation of the leased travel centers  including personnel  utilities  acquiring inventories  services to customers  insurance  real estate and personal property taxes  environmental related expenses and ground lease payments  if any 
as amended by the amendment agreement that we entered into with ta on january   which is further described below  the ta no 
lease requires ta to pay minimum rent to us in an amount of  per year for the period from january  through january   and an amount of  per year for the period commencing february  and continuing through december  the minimum rent payable by ta to us under the ta no 
lease may increase if we fund or reimburse the cost in excess of  see below for certain improvements to the leased ta travel centers 
as amended by the amendment agreement that we entered with ta on january   which is further described below  the ta no 
lease requires ta to pay minimum rent to us in an amount of  per year through june   and may increase if we fund or reimburse the cost for certain improvements to the leased petro travel centers 
starting in and  respectively  both the ta no 
and the ta no 
leases require ta to pay us additional rent equal to of increases in nonfuel gross revenues and of increases in gross fuel revenues at the leased travel centers over base amounts 
the increases in percentage rents attributable to fuel revenues are subject to a maximum each year calculated by reference to changes in the consumer price index 
as further discussed below  pursuant to  and subject to the conditions set forth in  the amendment agreement  we agreed to waive payments for the first  of percentage rent that may become due under ta lease with us for the petro branded travel centers 
ta is also required to generally indemnify us for certain environmental matters and for liabilities which arise during the terms of the leases from ownership or operation of the leased travel centers 
both the ta no 
and ta no 
leases also include arbitration provisions for the resolution of certain disputes  claims and controversies 
we had agreed to provide up to  of funding annually for the first five years of the ta no 
lease for certain improvements to the leased properties without an increase in rent 
all improvements funded under the tenant improvements allowance are owned by us 
on may   we and ta amended the ta lease to permit ta to sell to us  without an increase of its rent  certain capital improvements to properties leased from us earlier than previously permitted 
as ta elected to sell these capital improvements before the time contractually required by the original lease terms  our purchase commitment amount was discounted to reflect the accelerated receipt of funds by ta according to a present value formula established in the amended lease 
during and  ta sold to us qualifying capital improvements under the  tenant improvements allowance provided in the ta no 
lease  as amended in may  for total cash proceeds of  and  respectively 
we recorded the capital improvements at cost as we made these fundings 
as of december   none of the  total amount of the leasehold improvements saleable to us with no increase in ta rent remained available 
under the ta and petro leases  ta may request that we fund approved amounts for renovations  improvements and equipment at the leased travel centers  in addition to the  described above  in return for minimum annual rent increases according to a formula the minimum rent per year will be increased by an amount equal to the amount funded by us times the greater of i or ii a benchmark us treasury interest rate plus 
ta made no request for funds under this provision in  or at the time of ta spin off from us  our transactions with ta in connection with the petro lease and an equity offering completed by ta in june  we and ta believed that ta was adequately capitalized to meet all of its obligations  including those owed to us 
however  since then there were material changes in the market conditions under which ta operates 
specifically  the increase during the first half of in the price of diesel fuel which ta buys and sells at its travel centers and the slowing of the us economy during adversely affected ta business and increased its working capital requirements 
although ta undertook a restructuring of its business to adjust to these changed market conditions  ta balance sheet flexibility and liquidity remained a concern to us because of the impact the then weakening economy and fuel price volatility might have on ta working capital requirements 
accordingly  on august   we and ta entered a rent deferral agreement 
under the terms of this deferral agreement  ta had the option to defer its monthly rent payments to us by up to  per month for periods beginning july  until december   and ta was not obligated to pay cash interest on the deferred rent through december  also pursuant to the deferral agreement  ta issued  of its common shares to us approximately of ta shares then outstanding immediately after this new issuance 
under the terms of this agreement  interest began to accrue on deferred amounts outstanding on january   at per month  and we received and recorded  of income during  which has been reflected as rental income in our consolidated statements of income in accordance with gaap 
no additional rent deferrals were permitted for rent periods after december  any deferred rent and interest thereon not paid was contractually due to us on july  this deferral agreement also includes a prohibition on share repurchases and dividends by ta while any deferred rent remains unpaid and included change of control covenants so that amounts deferred will become immediately payable to us in the event ta experienced a change of control as defined in the agreement while deferred rent was unpaid 
also  in connection with this deferral agreement  we entered into a registration rights agreement with ta  which provides us with certain rights to require ta to conduct a registered public offering with respect to its common shares issued to us pursuant to the deferral agreement  which rights continue through the date which is twelve months following the latest of the expiration of the terms of the ta no 
lease and the ta no 
lease 
as of december  and  ta had accrued an aggregate of  and  respectively  of deferred rent payable to us 
in january  we and ta entered an amendment agreement that amended the ta no 
lease  the ta no 
lease and ta rent deferral agreement with us 
the amendment agreement and the potential settlement of litigation described below are further described in our current report on form k dated january  the amendment agreement provides that the minimum annual rent payable by ta to us under the ta no 
lease was reduced effective january   by approximately  to  the  increase in annual minimum rent payable by ta to us under the ta no 
lease that was scheduled to begin on february  was eliminated  but the rent due to us under the ta no 
lease will increase to  on february  the minimum annual rent payable by ta to us under the ta no 
lease was reduced effective january   by approximately  to  subject to approval by the delaware court of chancery of a settlement of the action described above in item litigation  we will waive payment of the first  of percentage rent which may become due under the ta no 
lease  which percentage rent obligation is described above 
litigation and a court approval process sometimes produce unexpected results 
we can provide no assurance that the required court approval will be obtained or that this settlement will be concluded 
the due date for the  of rent ta had deferred as of december   pursuant to ta rent deferral agreement with us was extended from july   so that  will be due and payable on december   and the remaining  will be due and payable on june   and interest shall cease to accrue on our deferred rent obligation beginning on january   provided  however  that the deferred rent amounts shall be accelerated and interest shall begin to accrue thereon if certain events occur  including a change of control of ta 
rmr provides management services to both us and ta  barry portnoy is a managing director of ta and a managing trustee of us  and there are other current and historical relationships between us and ta 
as a result  the terms of the deferral agreement  and the recent amendment agreement were negotiated and approved by special committees of our independent trustees and ta independent directors  none of whom are trustees or directors of the other company and each special committee was represented by separate counsel 
during   and  we recognized rental income of   and  respectively  under our lease agreements with ta 
at the time ta became a separate publicly owned company as a result of the distribution of its shares to our shareholders  ta entered a management and shared services agreement with rmr 
in addition  in connection with ta spin off  ta entered a transaction agreement with us and rmr  the terms of which require that ta afford us a right of first refusal to purchase  lease  mortgage or otherwise finance any interest ta owns in a travel center before it sells  leases  mortgages or otherwise finances that travel center to or with another party  and that ta afford us and any other company managed by rmr a right of first refusal to acquire or finance any real estate of the types in which we or they invest before ta does 
ta also agreed under this agreement that for so long as ta is a tenant of ours it will not permit the acquisition by any person or group of beneficial ownership of or more of the voting shares or the power to direct the management and policies of ta or any of its subsidiary tenants or guarantors under its leases with us  the sale of a material part of the assets of ta or any such tenant or guarantor  or the cessation of certain continuing directors constituting a majority of the board of directors of ta or any such tenant or guarantor 
also  under this agreement ta agreed not to take any action that might reasonably be expected to have a material adverse impact on our ability to qualify as a reit and to indemnify us for any liabilities we may incur relating to ta assets and business 
the transaction agreement includes arbitration provisions for the resolution of certain disputes  claims and controversies 
our independent trustees also serve as directors or trustees of other public companies to which rmr provides management services 
mr 
barry portnoy serves as a managing director or managing trustee of those companies  including ta  cwh  snh  gov and five star  and mr 
adam portnoy serves as a managing trustee of some of those companies  but not ta 
we understand that the other companies to which rmr provides management services also have relationships with each other  including business and property management agreements and lease arrangements 
in addition  officers of rmr serve as officers of those companies 
mr 
kleifges  our treasurer and chief financial officer  also serves as treasurer and chief financial officer of gov  which is a company to which rmr provides management services 
we understand that further information regarding those relationships is provided in the applicable periodic reports and proxy statements filed by those other companies with the sec 
we  rmr  ta  cwh  snh  gov and five star each currently own of aic  an indiana insurance company 
all of our trustees and nearly all of the trustees and directors of the other shareholders of aic currently serve on the board of directors of aic 
rmr  in addition to being a shareholder  provides management and administrative services to aic pursuant to a management and administrative services agreement with aic 
our governance guidelines provide that any material transaction between us and aic shall be reviewed  authorized and approved or ratified by both the affirmative vote of a majority of our entire board of trustees and the affirmative vote of a majority of our independent trustees 
the shareholders agreement among us  the other shareholders of aic and aic includes arbitration provisions for the resolution of certain disputes  claims and controversies 
as of february   we have invested  in aic since its formation in november we may invest additional amounts in aic in the future if the expansion of this insurance business requires additional capital  but we are not obligated to do so 
for and  we recognized losses of and  respectively  related to our investment in aic 
in june  we and the other shareholders of aic purchased property insurance providing  of coverage pursuant to an insurance program arranged by aic and with respect to which aic is a reinsurer of certain coverage amounts 
our annual premium for this property insurance of approximately  was paid in june we are currently investigating the possibilities to expand our insurance relationships with aic to include other types of insurance 
by participating in this insurance business with rmr and the other companies to which rmr provides management services  we expect that we may benefit financially by possibly reducing our insurance expenses or by realizing our pro rata share of any profits of this insurance business 
the foregoing descriptions of our agreements with rmr  ta and aic are summaries and are qualified in their entirety by the terms of the agreements which are among the exhibits listed in item of this annual report on form k and incorporated herein by reference 
in addition  copies of certain of those agreements are filed with the sec and may be obtained from the sec website at www 
sec 
gov 
we believe that our agreements with rmr  ta and aic are on commercially reasonable terms 
we also believe that our relationships with rmr  ta and aic benefit us  and  in fact  provide us with competitive advantages in operating and growing our business 
nonetheless  because of our various relationships with rmr  ta and aic it is possible that some investors may assert otherwise 
for instance  a purported shareholder derivative action  described above in item litigation has commenced against ta  its directors  us and rmr which alleges  among other matters  that the rent ta agreed to pay us under the ta no 
lease is too high and  as described above  we have recently agreed to settle this litigation to avoid the costs and risks associated with continuing this litigation 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are those that will have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and those requiring significant judgments and estimates 
we believe that our judgments and estimates are consistently applied and produce financial information that fairly presents our results of operations 
our most critical accounting policies involve our investments in real property 
these policies affect our classification of leases and the related impact on the recognition of rental income  allocation of purchase prices between various asset categories and the related impact on the recognition of depreciation and amortization expenses  assessment of the carrying values and impairments of real estate and intangible assets  variable interest entities  and income taxes 
certain of our properties are leased on a triple net basis  pursuant to non cancelable  fixed term  operating leases 
each time we enter a new lease or materially modify an existing lease we evaluate its classification as either a capital or operating lease 
the classification of a lease as capital or operating affects the carrying value of a property  as well as our recognition of rental payments as revenue 
these evaluations require us to make estimates of  among other things  the remaining useful life and market value of a leased property  appropriate present value discount rates and future cash flows 
incorrect assumptions or estimates may result in misclassification of our leases 
we allocate the acquisition cost of each property investment to various property components such as land  buildings and equipment and intangibles based on their fair values and each component generally has a different useful life 
for real estate acquired  we record building  land  furniture  fixtures and equipment  and  if applicable  the value of in place leases  the fair market value of above or below market leases and customer relationships at fair value 
we allocate the excess  if any  of the consideration over the fair value of assets acquired to goodwill 
we base purchase price allocations and the determination of useful lives on our estimates and  under some circumstances  studies from independent real estate appraisal firms to provide market information and evaluations that are relevant to our purchase price allocations and determinations of useful lives  however  we are ultimately responsible for the purchase price allocations and determination of useful lives 
we compute depreciation expense using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of up to years for buildings and improvements  and up to years for personal property 
we amortize the value of intangible assets over the shorter of their estimated useful lives  or the term of the respective lease or the affected contract 
we do not depreciate the allocated cost of land 
purchase price allocations and estimates of useful lives require us to make certain assumptions and estimates 
incorrect assumptions and estimates may result in inaccurate depreciation and amortization charges over future periods 
we periodically evaluate our real estate and other assets for possible impairment indicators 
these indicators may include weak or declining operating profitability  cash flow or liquidity  our decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life or market or industry changes that could permanently reduce the value of our investments 
if indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of the related investment by comparing it to the expected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from that investment 
if the sum of these expected future cash flows is less than the carrying value  we reduce the net carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value 
we test our indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test requires us to determine the estimated fair value of the intangible asset 
an impairment charge is recorded if the fair value is determined to be lower than the carrying value 
we determine the fair value for our long lived assets and indefinite lived intangible assets by evaluating recent financial performance and projecting discounted cash flows using standard industry valuation techniques 
these analyses require us to judge whether indicators of impairment exist and to estimate likely future cash flows 
if we misjudge or estimate incorrectly or if future operating profitability  market or industry factors differ from our expectations  we may record an impairment charge which is inappropriate  fail to record a charge when we should have done so or the amount of such charges may be inaccurate 
we have determined that each of our trss is a variable interest entity  or vie  as defined under the consolidation topic of the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification tm  or the codification 
we have concluded that we must consolidate each of our trss because we are the entity with the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact such vies performance and we have the obligation to absorb the majority of the potential variability in gains and losses of each vie  with the primary focus on losses  and are therefore the primary beneficiary of each vie 
we account for income taxes in accordance with the income taxes topic of the codification 
under this topic  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we establish valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are expected to be realized when necessary 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the irc and are generally not subject to federal and state income taxation on our operating income provided we distribute our taxable income to our shareholders and meet certain organization and operating requirements 
despite our reit status  we are subject to income tax in canada  puerto rico and in certain states 
further  we lease our managed hotels to our wholly owned trs that  unlike most of our subsidiaries  is generally subject to federal  state and foreign income tax 
our consolidated income tax provision or benefit includes the income tax provision or benefit related to the operations of the trs and state and foreign income taxes incurred by us despite our tax status as a reit 
the income taxes topic also prescribes how we should recognize  measure and present in our financial statements uncertain tax positions that have been taken or are expected to be taken in a tax return 
deferred tax benefits are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not that a particular tax position will be sustained upon examination or audit 
to the extent the more likely than not standard has been satisfied  the benefit associated with a tax position is measured as the largest amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
tax returns filed for the through tax years are subject to examination by taxing authorities 
we classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions  if any  in our financial statements as a component of general and administrative expense 
these policies involve significant judgments made based upon experience  including judgments about current valuations  ultimate realizable value  estimated useful lives  salvage or residual value  the ability and willingness of our tenants and operators to perform their obligations to us  and the current and likely future operating and competitive environments in which our properties operate 
in the future  we may need to revise our carrying value assessments to incorporate information which is not now known  and such revisions could increase or decrease our depreciation expense related to properties we own  result in the classification of our leases as other than operating leases or decrease the carrying values of our assets 
property management agreements  leases and operating statistics as of december   we owned hotels and travel centers that are grouped into operating agreements 
our hotels are managed by or leased to subsidiaries of hotel operating companies including intercontinental  marriott  host  crestline  hyatt and carlson under agreements 
our travel centers are leased to and operated by subsidiaries of ta under two agreements 
the tables on the following pages summarize the key terms of our leases and management agreements as of december  the tables also include statistics reported to us or derived from information reported to us by our managers and tenants 
these statistics include coverage of our minimum returns or minimum rents and occupancy  adr  and revpar  for our hotel properties 
we consider these statistics and the management agreement or lease security features also presented in the tables on the following pages  to be important measures of our managers and tenants success in operating our properties and their ability to continue to pay us 
however  none of this third party reported information is a direct measure of our financial performance and we have not independently verified this data

seasonality our hotels and travel centers have historically experienced seasonal differences typical of their industries with higher revenues in the second and third quarters of calendar years compared with the first and fourth quarters 
so long as guarantees and security deposits are available to supplement earnings shortfalls at our properties  this seasonality is not expected to cause material fluctuations in our income or cash flow because our contractual management agreements and leases require our managers and tenants to make the substantial portion of our return payments and rents to us in equal amounts throughout a year 
if and as guarantees and security deposits which secure the minimum rents and returns due to us are exhausted our financial results may begin to reflect the seasonality of the industries in which our tenants and managers operate 
impact of inflation inflation might have both positive and negative impacts upon us 
inflation might cause the value of our real estate investments to increase 
in an inflationary environment  the percentage returns and rents which we receive based upon a percentage of gross revenues should increase 
offsetting these benefits  inflation might cause our costs of equity and debt capital and other operating costs to increase 
an increase in our capital costs or in our operating costs will result in decreased earnings unless it is offset by increased revenues 
in periods of rapid inflation  our managers or tenants operating costs may increase faster than revenues and this fact may have an adverse impact upon us if the operating income from our properties becomes insufficient to pay our returns or rents and the security features  such as security deposits or guarantees of our returns or rents are exhausted 
to mitigate the adverse impact of increased costs of debt capital in the event of material inflation  we may enter into interest rate hedge arrangements in the future  the decision to enter into these agreements will be based on the amount of our floating rate debt outstanding  our belief that material interest rate increases are likely to occur and upon requirements of our borrowing arrangements 
impact of climate change the ongoing political debate about climate change has resulted in various treaties  laws and regulations which are intended to limit carbon emissions 
we believe these laws being enacted or proposed may cause energy costs at our hotel and travel center properties to increase 
we do not expect the direct impact of these increases to be material to our results of operations  because the increased costs either would be the responsibility of our tenants or operators directly or in the longer term  passed through and paid by customers of our properties 
although we do not believe it is likely in the foreseeable future  laws enacted to mitigate climate change may make some of our buildings obsolete or cause us to make material investments in our properties which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or the financial condition of our tenants or operators and their ability to pay rent or returns to us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollar amounts in thousands we are exposed to risks associated with market changes in interest rates 
we manage our exposure to this market risk by monitoring available financing alternatives 
our strategy to manage exposure to changes in interest rates is unchanged from december  other than as described below  we do not foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or in how we manage this exposure in the near future 
as of december   our outstanding publicly tradable debt consisted of seven issues of fixed rate  senior unsecured notes and one issue of fixed rate  convertible senior notes principal balance annual interest rate annual interest expense maturity interest payments due   semi annually   semi annually   semi annually   semi annually   semi annually   semi annually   semi annually   semi annually the convertible senior notes are convertible  if certain conditions are met including certain changes in control  into cash equal to the principal amount of the notes and  to the extent the market price of our common shares exceeds the initial exchange price of per share  subject to adjustment  either cash or our common shares at our option with a value based on such excess amount 
holders of our convertible senior notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the notes on march   march   and march   or upon the occurrence of certain change in control events prior to march  except as described in the footnote to the table above  no principal repayments are due under these notes until maturity 
because these notes bear interest at fixed rates  changes in market interest rates during the term of this debt will not affect our operating results 
however  if we refinance these notes at maturity at interest rates which are higher than shown above  our per annum interest cost would increase by approximately  changes in market interest rates also affect the fair value of our debt obligations  increases in market interest rates decrease the fair value of our fixed rate debt while decreases in market interest rates increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
based on the balances outstanding at december   and discounted cash flow analyses  a hypothetical immediate change in interest rates would change the fair value of our fixed rate debt obligations by approximately  changes in the trading price of our common shares may also affect the fair value of our  of convertible senior notes 
each of these fixed rate unsecured debt arrangements allows us to make repayments earlier than the stated maturity date 
we are generally allowed to make prepayments only at face value plus a make whole amount  as defined  which is generally designed to preserve a stated yield to the noteholder 
these prepayment rights may afford us the opportunity to mitigate the risk of refinancing at maturity at higher rates by refinancing prior to maturity 
at december   we had one mortgage note payable  secured by one hotel  which has a principal balance of  and a fixed interest rate of 
on january   we repaid  without penalty  the remaining principal balance of this mortgage  plus accrued interest 
our revolving credit facility bears interest at floating rates and matures in october at december   we had  outstanding and  available to draw under our revolving credit facility 
repayments under this agreement may be made at any time without penalty 
we borrow in us dollars and borrowings under these agreements are subject to interest at libor plus a spread 
accordingly  we are vulnerable to changes in us dollar short term interest rates  specifically libor 
in addition  upon renewal or refinancing of our revolving credit facility  we are vulnerable to increases in credit spreads due to market conditions 
a change in interest rates would not affect the value of this floating rate debt but would affect our operating results 
our exposure to fluctuations in floating interest rates will increase or decrease in the future with changes in the outstanding amounts under our revolving credit facility 
the following table presents the impact of a change in interest rates would have on our annual floating rate interest expense as of december  impact of changes in interest rates interest rate per year outstanding debt total interest expense per year at december  reduction increase the foregoing table shows the impact of an immediate change in floating interest rates 
if interest rates were to change gradually over time  the impact would be spread over time 
our exposure to fluctuations in floating interest rates will increase or decrease in the future with increases or decreases in the outstanding amount under our revolving credit facility or other floating rate debt
