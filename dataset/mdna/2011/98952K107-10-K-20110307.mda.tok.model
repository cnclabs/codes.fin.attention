table of contents we made solid progress executing our long term growth strategy  which focuses on expanding our production capacity  building a well known brand  exploiting our sales capabilities by accessing more retail outlets and sales channels 
overview we are principally engaged in the meat and food processing and distribution business in china 
currently  we have processing plants in china  located in henan  jilin and sichuan provinces and in the city of tianjin 
our current total production capacity for chilled pork and frozen pork is approximately  metric tons per eight hour day  or approximately  metric tons on an annual basis 
in addition  we have production capacity for prepared meats of approximately metric tons per eight hour day  or approximately  metric tons on an annual basis  and for vegetables and fruits of approximately metric tons per eight hour day  or approximately  metric tons on an annual basis 
we also have annual production capacity for food oil pork oil of approximately  metric tons 
we use state of the art equipment in all of our processing facilities 
the following table shows  as of march   the annual production capacity of our processing plants based on an eight hour working day 
annual capacity product location in metric tons chilled and frozen pork changge  henan province gongzhulin  jilin province deyang  sichuan province zhumadian  henan province anyang  henan province luoyang  henan province tianjin municipality yongcheng  henan province prepared meats changge  henan province vegetables and fruits changge  henan province food oil pork oil changge  henan province we believe we must continue to expand our production capacity to seize additional market share 
as a result  we put into operation  are currently constructing  or plan to construct  additional production facilities in different parts of china 
we put the new facility in tianjin with a production capacity of approximately  metric tons for chilled and frozen pork into operation in january the construction of phase two of the facility  with a production capacity of approximately  metric tons for prepared pork products started in october we expect to put it into operation in the second quarter of 
table of contents we have invested approximately million to build an additional production facility in changge city  henan province 
this facility is being designed with a production capacity of  metric tons for food oil pork oil 
we put this facility into operation in april the expansion project of our facility in anyang city was completed in august as we planned 
after expansion  anyang facility s pre cooling room and equipment have improved  and its annual capacity has increased from  metric tons to  metric tons 
we are investing approximately million to build a slaughtering and processing plant  low temperature prepared pork plant  logistics center  and research and development center in nong an county  changchun  jilin province of china 
this facility will have a production capacity of approximately  metric tons for chilled pork   metric tons for frozen pork  and  metric tons for prepared pork products 
the construction work started in september we expect to put the new facility for chilled and frozen pork into operation in the fourth quarter of and the new facility for prepared pork products into operation in the third quarter of we are investing approximately million to build a production facility  warehouse and distribution center in taizhou  jiangsu province 
this facility will have a production capacity of approximately  metric tons for chilled and frozen pork  of which will be for chilled pork including easy to cook products and for frozen pork  and  metric tons for prepared pork products 
the construction work started in october we expect to put the new facility for chilled and frozen pork into operation in the third quarter of and the new facility for prepared pork products into operation in the first quarter of we expect to invest approximately million to build a new production  research and development  and training complex in changge  henan province  excluding the cost of land use rights that we have already obtained 
when completed  we anticipate that this new facility will have a production capacity of approximately  metric tons for prepared pork products 
adjacent to this new production facility  we also plan to develop a center for research and development  training  as well as quality control 
construction for the first phase with a production capacity of approximately  metric tons for prepared pork products is scheduled to start in the first quarter of and be completed by the third quarter of  and we expect the second phase  also with a production capacity of approximately  metric tons for prepared pork products  to be completed by the fourth quarter of we also plan to open the research and development and training center by the fourth quarter of we believe these plants will enable us to achieve synergies in certain areas  including the purchase of raw materials  logistics and marketing 
to further expand our business and to upgrade the zhongpin brand from a regional brand to a national brand  we intend to expand our production into other provinces in which pork is traditionally consumed in significant quantities and in which there is a sufficient hog supply 
in an effort to minimize our risk and the potential of losses when expanding into new markets  we have entered certain markets by leasing  rather than purchasing or constructing  our production facilities because we believe that  even after conducting comprehensive market research and professional due diligence  there is significant risk that a market will not generate the level of sales we expect 
in the future  we would like to replicate our success in h enan province in other provinces in northern and eastern china where we would like to build capacity clusters similar to the cluster we 
table of contents constructed in henan province 
we intend to lease  acquire or build new facilities to support the development of our target markets 
our capacity utilization rate was approximately  and for  and  respectively 
the capacity utilization rate is calculated by using our production quantity divided by our weighted average capacity in each year 
our capacity utilization rate fluctuated during those periods due to the supply of live hogs and raw materials in certain periods  the price fluctuation for live hogs in different areas near our production facilities  our maintenance of machinery and facilities  and our sales capability 
our ability to maintain higher utilization rates is also impacted by how quickly we are able to ramp up production at newly constructed facilities and how quickly the market for our products develops in new target geographies 
our target capacity utilization rate at our production facilities is approximately for chilled and frozen pork products facilities and ap proximately for prepared pork products facilities 
the utilization rate we maintained in was primarily due to the strong market demand for our products 
we anticipate that it will typically require three to six months for utilization rates at our new production facilities to reach our target utilization rate 
our products are sold under the zhongpin brand name 
as of december   our customers included international and domestic fast food companies in china  processing factories and  school cafeterias  factory canteens  hotels  army bases  and government departments 
at such date  we also sold directly to  retail outlets  including supermarkets  within china 
we have established distribution networks in provinces and in the four central government administered municipalities of beijing  shanghai  tianjin and chongqing in the north  east  south and mid south regions of china  and have also formed strategic business alliances with leading supermarket chains within china 
we also export our products to europe  hong kong as well as other selected countries and regions in asia 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we continually evaluate our policies and estimation procedures 
estimates are often based on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  but which could change in the future 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following represent the areas where more critical estimates and assumptions are used in the preparation of the financial statements revenue recognition 
revenues generated from the sale of various meat products and vegetables and fruits are recognized when these products are delivered to customers in accordance with previously agreed upon pricing and delivery arrangements  and the collectability of these sales is reasonably assured 
since the products sold by us are primarily perishable and frozen food products  the right of return is only for a few days and has been determined to be insignificant by our management 
accordingly  no provision has been made for returnable goods 
revenues presented on our consolidated income statements are net of sales taxes 

table of contents accounts receivable 
during the normal course of business  our policy is to ask larger customers to make deposits in reasonable and meaningful amounts on a case by case basis 
for certain newly developed customers  we may extend unsecured credit 
we regularly evaluate and monitor the creditworthiness of each of our customers in accordance with the prevailing practice in the meat industry  considering factors such as general economic conditions and industry specific economic condition in china  historical customer performance  as well as anticipated customer performance 
we maintain a general policy of providing allowance for doubtful accounts in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of those accounts that are not collected within one year plus an amount equal to of the aggregate amount of accounts receivable less than one year old 
after all attempts to collect a receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the allowance 
we also examine the credit terms of significant customers regularly and ask for more cash deposits if these customers appear to have any indicators of delaying their payme nts to us 
such deposits are usually applied towards the outstanding accounts receivable 
the focus of our collection effort is on receivable balances less than one year old  as receivable over a year old has typically been insignificant compared to the total gross receivable 
with such a practice in place  we did not have any specific bad debt allowance provided against specific customers as of december  inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined on a weighted average basis  and net realizable value 
work in progress and finished goods are composed of direct material  direct labor and an attributable portion of manufacturing overhead 
net realizable value is the estimated selling price  in the ordinary course of business  less estimated costs to complete and dispose 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows  the carrying amount is compared to its fair value and an impairment charge is recognized to the extent of the difference 
factors that we consider important which could individually or in combination trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and negative industry or economic trends 
on an annual basis  we assess whether events or changes in circumstances occur that potentially indicate that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
we concluded that there were no such events or changes in circumstances during fiscal income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequence attributable to the difference between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled 
if it is more likely than not some portion or all of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized  the deferre d tax asset will be reduced by a valuation allowance 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date 
we were established under the laws of the state of delaware and are subject to us federal income tax and delaware state income tax 
falcon link was established under the laws of the british virgin islands and is not subject to income tax in accordance with the laws and regulations of the british 
table of contents virgin islands 
our other operating subsidiaries  which are located in china  are subject to the prc enterprise income tax eit law  which was effective january  and has a uniform statutory tax rate of 
under the eit law  income derived by an enterprise primarily from the processing of agricultural products including slaughtering live hogs is exempt from eit 
consequently  the majority of our subsidiaries in china that engage in the slaughtering of live hogs are exempted from eit 
such exempted income before income tax is deemed as part of a permanent difference for the purpose of dete rmining the proper income tax provision 
our remaining subsidiaries in china are subject to the uniform tax rate on non primary processing of agricultural products 
there is no consolidated enterprise income tax return concept in china 
as a result  if one subsidiary has net income  that net income cannot be offset by the loss incurred by another subsidiary within the group of companies consolidated for financial reporting purposes 
similarly  if one subsidiary has a net operating loss  that net operating loss cannot be offset by the net income in another subsidiary within the group of companies consolidated for financial reporting purposes 
for the years ended december   and  there were no unrecognized tax benefits or interest and penalties for uncertain tax positions recorded in income tax expense 
we have no unrecognized tax benefit included in the consolidated balance sheet that would  if recognized  affect the effective tax rate 
value added tax 
in addition to enterprise income tax  our operating subsidiaries located in china are also subject to value added tax imposed by the prc government on their domestic product sales 
the output vat is charged to customers who purchase goods from us and the input vat is paid when we purchase goods from our vendors 
the input vat can be offset against the output vat  however  due to the prc government prescribed ceiling on how much input vat an enterprise may deduct in any given month  an input vat recoverable balance is generated  to be offset against future output vat 
similar to eit  vat recoverable cannot be utilized by another subsidiary within the group of companies consolidated for financial reporting purposes 
on a semi annual basis  we forecast for each subsidiary separately the amount of sales revenue necessary to fully utilize the vat recoverable 
the factors we consider in performing these forecasts include industry specific and local economic conditions  as well as consumer behavior by the subs idiaries designated geographical region and the demographics within those regions 
once the vat recoverable for a subsidiary is determined to be non recoverable in part or in full  the vat recoverable is written off as impairment loss 
for the years ended december    and    and of impairment loss were recognized  respectively 
stock compensation 
we adopted the financial accounting standards board  accounting standards codification topic  stock compensation  asc  formerly fasb statement r  which requires the measurement at fair value and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards 
the determination of the fair value of our stock options at the grant date requires judgment 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of these share based awards consistent with the provisions of asc option pricing models  including the black scholes model  also require the use of input assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  expected dividend rate  and expec ted risk free rate of return 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of asc in future periods  the compensation expense recorded under asc may differ significantly from the amount recorded in the current period 
during fiscal  expected stock price volatility and the assumed risk free rate both increased slightly based upon recent historical trends 
these changes are not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
there were no other material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine stock based compensation during fiscal

comparison of years ended december  and december  revenue 
total revenue increased from million in to million in  which represented an increase of million  or approximately 
the increase in revenues was primarily due to increased sales volume in our meat and meat products segment resulting from the effects of the continuing increases in the number of our retail stores  geographic expansion and increased sales to food service distributors in china during the year

we have been pricing our products based on the value of our brand  the quality of our products  hog prices in the applicable period and pricing trends for similar products in the regions in which we operate 
in  we increased our sales of chilled pork products by approximately million over the amount of our sales of such products in as shown in the table above  our average price during was approximately  per metric ton for chilled pork  compared to  during  an increase of 
the number of metric tons of chilled pork sold during increased by  or from our total revenue increased primarily due to successful capacity expansion  increased sales to existing customers  and significantly increased volume of sales of our products as we entered new geographic markets  expanded our points of sales and acquired new customers  and partially due to the increase in average price in as a result of market fluctuations

the number of metric tons of prepared pork products sold during increased by  or  from this product division is becoming more important to our business as customers increasingly demand prepared pork products 
in  we introduced to the market a more economically priced prepared pork product which was well received by our customers 
the change in product mix with more customers purchasing the new product caused the average metric per ton price to decrease compared to we plan to gradually increase sales from prepared pork products by building up our brand recognition and exp anding our capacities for this division 

table of contents the sales of meat and vegetable products are closely related to the particular regional markets in which our distribution channels are located 
therefore  the increase in metric tons sold in was partly attributable to our effort to expand our distribution channels 
the following table sets forth the changes in our distribution channels numbers of stores and cities generating sales volume december  net percentage change of change showcase store branded stores supermarket counters total first tier cities second tier cities third tier cities total the expansion in our distribution channels and geographical coverage has been a significant factor in the increase in our sales volume 
the following table shows our revenues by distribution channel in and  respectively

table of contents cost of sales 
as discussed above  all of our meat products are derived from the same raw materials  which are live hogs 
our vegetable and fruit products are purchased from farmers located close to our processing facility in changge city  henan province 
as a result  the purchasing costs of live hogs and vegetables and fruits represent substantially all of our costs of raw materials 
our costs of sales primarily include our costs of raw materials  labor costs and overhead

as a result  our gross profit margin was lower than the level we would expect to achieve once we fully integrate our new production facilities and expand into new regional markets for our products 
we intend to adjust our production levels and product mix and the percentages of our sales through our different sales channels in the coming quarters to increase our gross profit margin 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in  which represented an increase of million  or approximately 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased from in to in the increase in general and administrative expenses during the year ended december  was primarily the result of a million increase in salary expense due to the expansion of our business  which required the hiring of more employees and management staff  and a million increase in depreciation due to our capacity expansion  which required more property  plant and equipment

research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million in  which represented an increase of million 
the increase in research and development expenses was due to the company s increased effort in developing new products during impairment loss 
impairment loss increased from million in to million in the increase is due to the write off of the value added tax vat recoverable from the heilongjiang facility 
we terminated the lease of that facility in but still used the heilongjiang subsidiary as a portal to the local market 
in  we re evaluated the performance of the subsidiary and determined that it would be more cost effective to cover the local market by our jilin facility and we closed the heilongjiang subsidiary in as a result  we determined that the recoverability of the heilongjiang subsidiary s vat is not likely and wrote it off as an impairment loss in interest expense 
interest expense increased from million in to million in  which represented an increase of million  or approximately 
the increase in interest expense was primarily a result of an increase of million in short term bank loans  an increase of million in long term bank loans and an increase in the interest rates published by the people s bank of china  the central bank of china  which increases were partly offset by an increase in interest income 
other income and government subsidies 
other income and government subsidies increased from million in to million in  which represented an increase of million or approximately 
the increase was because we received more government subsidies during the year that are both earmarked and non earmarked 
we have experienced an increase in government subsidies because by expanding into new regional markets and constructing new facilities in new areas  we have recently qualified to apply for more government subsidies 
the prc government provides subsidies to support businesses in the agriculture and related industries  such as ours 
our business  including hog breeding  pork processing  vegetable and fruit processing and cold chain logistics as well as related food safety and technological innovations  all enjoy policy support from the prc government 
we expect to continue to receive government subsidies in future periods  as the prc gover nment continues its policy of promoting agriculture and related industries

segment information under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  we operate in only one segment meat production 
our vegetable and fruit operations  both financially and operationally  do not represent a significant enough portion of our business to constitute a separate segment 
however  our product lines have been divided into two divisions pork and pork products  and vegetables and fruits 
our pork and pork products division is involved primarily in the processing of live hogs into fresh  frozen and processed pork products 
our pork and pork products division markets its products domestically to our retail stores  food retailers  foodservice distributors  restaurant operators and noncommercial foodservice establishments  such as schools  hotel chains  healthcare facilities  the military and other food processors  as well as to international markets 
our vegetables and fruits division is involved primarily in the processing of fresh vegetables and fruits 
we contract with more than farms in henan province and nearby areas to produce high quality vegetable varieties and fruits suitable for export 
the proximity of the contracted farms to our operations ensures freshness from harvest to processing

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk disclosures about market risk we may be exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of business 
market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur as a result of movements in interest rates and equity prices 
we currently do not use financial instruments in the normal course of business that are subject to changes in financial market conditions 
currency fluctuations and foreign currency risk substantially all of our operations are conducted in china  with the exception of our export business and limited overseas purchases of raw materials 
most of our sales and purchases are conducted within china in rmb  which is the official currency of china 
as a result  the effect of the fluctuations of exchange rates is considered minimal to our business operations 

table of contents substantially all of our revenues and expenses are denominated in rmb 
however  we use the united states dollar for financial reporting purposes 
conversion of rmb into foreign currencies is regulated by the people s bank of china through a unified floating exchange rate system 
although the prc government has stated its intention to support the value of rmb  there can be no assurance that such exchange rate will not again become volatile or that rmb will not devalue significantly against the us dollar 
exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect the value  in us dollar terms  of our net assets and income derived from our operations in china 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk through our short term and long term loans 
we have million short term bank loans and million long term bank loans outstanding as of december   and we have not used any derivative financial instruments or engaged in any interest rate hedging activities to manage our interest rate risk exposure 
our future interest expense on short term or long term bank loans may increase or decrease due to changes in market interest rates 
we monitor interest rates in conjunction with our cash requirements to determine the appropriate level of bank loans relative to other sources of funds 
credit risk we have not experienced significant credit risk  as most of our customers are long term customers with superior payment records 
our receivables are monitored regularly by our credit managers
