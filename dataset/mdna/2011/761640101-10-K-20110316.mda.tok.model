overview our company resulted from the merger of corporate road show 
com inc  a new york corporation incorporated in november  and rexahn  corp  a maryland corporation  immediately after giving effect to our reincorporation as a delaware corporation under the name rexahn pharmaceuticals  inc in connection with that transaction  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours merged with and into rexahn  corp  with rexahn  corp remaining as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of ours 
in exchange for their shares of capital stock in rexahn  corp  the former stockholders of rexahn  corp received shares of common stock representing approximately of the company s outstanding equity after giving effect to the transaction 
further  upon the effective time of the merger  our historic business was abandoned and the business plan of rexahn  corp was adopted 
the transaction was therefore accounted for as a reverse acquisition with rexahn  corp as the accounting acquiring party and cprd as the acquired party 
in september  rexahn  corp was merged with and into the company 
our efforts and resources have been focused primarily on acquiring and developing our pharmaceutical technologies  raising capital and recruiting personnel 
we are a development stage company and have no product sales to date and we will not receive any product sales until we receive approval from the fda or equivalent foreign regulatory bodies to begin selling our pharmaceutical candidates 
our major sources of working capital have been proceeds from various private financings  primarily private sales of common stock and debt securities  and collaboration agreements with our strategic investors 
critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and requires our management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our accounting policies are in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and their basis of application is consistent with that of the previous year 
our significant estimates include assumptions made in estimating the fair values of stock based compensation and our assessment relating to the impairment of intangible assets and deferred revenues 
research and development research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses consist primarily of third party service costs under research and development agreements  salaries and related personnel costs  as well as stock compensation related to these costs  costs to acquire pharmaceutical products and product rights for development and amounts paid to contract research organizations  hospitals and laboratories for the provision of services and materials for drug development and clinical trials 

index costs incurred in obtaining the license rights to technology in the research and development stage that have no alternative future uses and are for unapproved product compounds are expensed as incurred 
fair value of financial instruments the carrying amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements for cash and cash equivalents  prepaid expenses and other current assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short term maturity of these financial instruments 
the fair value methodology for our derivative instruments is described in detail in item of this form k 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of the assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates 
asc requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all portions of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
a review of all positive and negative evidence needs to be considered  including a company s current and past performance  the market environment in which the company operates  length of carryback and carryforward periods and existing contracts that will result in future profits 
income tax expense is recorded for the amount of income tax payable or refundable for the period  increased or decreased by the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period 
as a result of the company s significant cumulative losses  we determined that it was appropriate to establish a valuation allowance for the full amount of our deferred tax assets 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty associated with the application of complex tax laws 
we are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
we believe that as a result of our losses sustained to date  any examination would result in a reduction of our net operating losses rather than a tax liability 
as such  we have not provided for additional taxes estimated under asc warrant liabilities in accordance with asc  distinguishing liabilities from equity  and asc  derivatives and hedging  we record warrant liabilities at fair value due to provisions in our warrant agreements  as discussed in footnote of item of this form k 
we reevaluate the fair value of our warrants at each reporting period  and changes in the fair value between reporting periods is records as unrealized gain loss on fair value of warrants in the statement of operations 
put feature on common stock we extended anti dilution protection provisions on our common stock to our investors in our december and march financings  whereby in the event that we sell or issue shares below the effective purchase price paid  the investors would thereupon receive additional shares in a ratio outlined in the securities purchase agreement 
in accordance with asc topic  distinguishing liabilities from equity  this feature is a written put on our common stock  and is classified as a liability at fair value 
we reevaluate the fair value at each reporting period  and changes in the fair value reporting is recorded as unrealized gain loss on put feature on common stock in the statement of operations 

index stock based compensation in accordance with asc  stock compensation compensation costs related to share based payment transactions  including employee stock options  are to be recognized in the financial statements 
in addition  the company adheres to the guidance set forth within securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which provides the staff s views regarding the interaction between asc and certain sec rules and regulations  and provides interpretations with respect to the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with asc  property  plant and equipment  long lived assets to be held and used are analyzed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the company evaluates at each balance sheet date whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate possible impairment 
if there are indications of impairment  the company uses future undiscounted cash flows of the related asset or asset grouping over the remaining life in measuring whether the assets are recoverable 
in the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded asset values  the assets are written down to their estimated fair value 
management determined that an impairment of intangible assets occurred in and wrote off the assets remaining carrying value of  concentration of credit risk asc  financial instruments  requires disclosure of any significant off balance sheet risk and credit risk concentration 
the company does not have significant off balance sheet risk or credit concentration 
the company maintains cash and short term investments with major financial institutions 
from time to time the company has funds on deposit with commercial banks that exceed federally insured limits 
the balances are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation up to  at december   the company uninsured cash balances or  management does not consider this to be a significant credit risk as these banks and financial institutions are well known 
recent accounting pronouncements affecting the company fair value measurements in january   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance which requires  in both interim and annual financial statements  for assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis  disclosures regarding the valuation techniques and inputs used to develop those measurements 
it also requires separate disclosures of significant amounts transferred in and out of level and level fair value measurements and a description of the reasons for the transfers 
this guidance is effective for the company beginning january  and is required to be applied prospectively to new or significantly modified revenue arrangements 
management currently believes that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
milestone method of revenue recognition 
index in april   the fasb issued guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research and development transactions 
consideration that is contingent on achievement of a milestone in its entirety may be recognized as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone is judged to meet certain criteria to be considered substantive 
milestones should be considered substantive in their entirety and may not be bifurcated 
an arrangement may contain both substantive and nonsubstantive milestones  and each milestone should be evaluated individually to determine if it is substantive 
this guidance is effective on a prospective basis for milestones in fiscal years and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
the company is evaluating the impact this guidance may have on its financial statements 

index results of operations comparison of the year ended december  and the year ended december  total revenues research revenue remained constant at  for the years ended december  december  research revenue consists of the amortization of the contribution made by rexgene for the joint development of archexin 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and other administrative personnel  recruitment expenses  professional fees and other corporate expenses  including business development  investor relations  and general legal activities 
general and administrative expenses increased  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributed to the  value of compensatory stock issued to two vendors in exchange for investor relations services  as well as increased legal costs and insurance costs 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers for laboratory development and other expenses relating to the design  development  testing  and enhancement of our drug candidates 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
research and development expenses increased  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to the costs associated with the commencement of serdaxin s phase iib clinical trial in the fourth quarter  and the ongoing development of rx research and development costs also increased due to costs associated with the phase ii clinical trials of archexin and zoraxel  as well as pre clinical pipeline development 
research and development expenses were offset by a grant of  from the federal government which we were eligible under the qualified therapeutic discovery project program 
patent fees our patent fees increased  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to legal costs to respond to patent applications for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased  or to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to the amortization of the leasehold improvements to our office space  which were placed in service midway through  but were in service for the entire year ended december  
index interest income interest income increased  or to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase is due to a greater average cash balance due to financings for the year ended december   and higher interest rates on interest bearing investments 
other income other income for the year ended december  was  which represents the settlement received from amarex to resolve a payment dispute as described in footnote of item of this form k 
we did not have other income for the year ended december  unrealized loss gain on fair value of warrants our warrants are recorded as liabilities at fair value 
warrants are valued using a lattice model 
changes in the fair value of warrants are recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in our statement of operations 
in fiscal year and  respectively  we recorded an unrealized loss gain on the fair value of our warrants of  and  the variance in the unrealized loss gain between the years ended december  and december  is primarily due to changes on our stock price 
the change in the fair value of our warrants is a non cash item reflected in our financial statements 
unrealized gain on fair value of put feature on common stock we extended anti dilution protection to our investors in our december  and march  financings 
according to the provision  in the event that we issue shares below an effective price paid by these investors  the investor would thereupon receive additional shares in a ration outlined in the securities purchase agreement 
in accordance with asc  the anti dilution provision is a written put recorded as a liability at fair value on our balance sheet 
the provision is valued using a lattice model 
changes in the fair value of the put feature are recorded as an unrealized gain or loss in our statement of operations 
for the year ended december   we recorded an unrealized gain on the fair value of the put feature of  compared to an unrealized gain of  for the year ended december  the variance in the unrealized gain between the years ended december  and results from the put feature expiring in december  and march  the change in the fair value of the put feature is a non cash item reflected in our financial statements 
net loss as a result of the above  net loss for the year ended december  was  or per share  compared to a net loss of  or per share  for the year ended december  restatement of financial statements the financial statements were restated to reclassify the warrants and put feature on our common stock from equity to liabilities  as discussed in the explanatory note to this form k 
the resulting impact of this reclassification on the warrants is a decrease in the net loss of  for the year ended december   a decrease in the accumulated deficit of  as of january   an increase in liabilities of  as of december  and a decrease in additional paid in capital of  as of december  the resulting impact of this reclassification on the put feature on the common stock is a decrease in net loss of  for the year ended december   a decrease in the accumulated deficit of  as of january   an increase in the liabilities of  as of december   and a decrease in additional paid in capital of  as of december  the adjustments reflect non cash items in the financial statements 

index research and development projects research and development expenses are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  costs to acquire pharmaceutical products and product rights for development and amounts paid to contract research organizations  hospitals and laboratories for the provision of services and materials for drug development and clinical trials 
costs incurred in obtaining the license rights to technology in the research and development stage and have no alternative future uses are expensed as incurred 
our research and development programs are related to our three clinical stage lead drug candidates  archexin  serdaxin and zoraxel and pre clinical stage drug candidates  rx  rx  rx  rx  rx nano  rx nano  and nano polymer anticancer drugs 
each of our lead drug candidates is in various stages of completion as described below 
as we expand our clinical studies  we will enter into additional development agreements 
significant additional expenditures will be required if we complete our clinical trials  start new trials  apply for regulatory approvals  continue development of our technologies  expand our operations and bring our products to market 
the eventual total cost of each clinical trial is dependent on a number of uncertainties such as trial design  the length of the trial  the number of clinical sites and the number of patients 
the process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for new therapeutic products is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
because the successful development of our most advanced drug candidates  archexin  serdaxin and zoraxel  is uncertain  and because rx  rx  rx  rx  rx nano  rx nano  and nano polymer anticancer drugs are in early stage development  we are unable to estimate the costs of completing our research and development programs  the timing of bringing such programs to market and  therefore  when material cash inflows could commence from the sale of these drug candidates 
if these projects are not completed as planned  our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected and if we are unable to obtain additional financing to fund these projects  we may not be able to continue as a going concern 
the table below summarizes the amounts spent on each of our research and development projects through december  cumulative from march  inception to december  clinical candidates archexin serdaxin zoraxel preclinical candidates rx other preclinical compounds 
index archexin archexin  a nucleotide single stranded dna anti sense molecule  is a best in class inhibitor of the protein kinase akt 
akt plays critical roles in cancer cell proliferation  survival  angiogenesis  metastasis  and drug resistance 
archexin received orphan drug designation from the us food and drug administration  or fda  for five cancer indications renal cell carcinoma  or rcc  glioblastoma  ovarian cancer  stomach cancer and pancreatic cancer 
the fda orphan drug program provides seven years of marketing exclusivity after approval and tax incentives for clinical research 
in october  we announced the conclusion of the phase i clinical trial of archexin  our leading drug candidate 
the phase i clinical trial of archexin  which took place at georgetown university and the university of alabama  was an open label  dose escalation study with day continuous infusion in patients with solid tumors 
the phase i trial was intended primarily to assess the safety and tolerability of archexin in patients with advanced cancer 
the trial results showed that the dose limiting toxicity of archexin occurring at mg m dose in the form of fatigue 
no other serious adverse events such as hematological toxicities were observed in this phase i study 
in the phase i study stable disease was observed in two out of the patients 
archexin is currently being studied in a phase ii clinical trial for the treatment of pancreatic cancer with several patients enrolled and enrollment continuing in the archexin phase iia trial is a single arm  open label study with subjects conducted at global sites in the united states and india 
archexin will be administered in combination with gemcitabine in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer to assess safety and preliminary efficacy  maximum tolerated dose  and overall survival 
archexin s phase ii clinical trial protocol for the treatment of rcc was accepted by the fda  but issues with enrollment have delayed the trial 
the enrollment issues were primarily due to the small number of patients that have been diagnosed with rcc and the fact that such patients are often treated with surgery instead of drug therapies 
after further consideration of the trial design and the limited number of patients  there was a reallocation of resources and rexahn reprioritized archexin to pursue studies in pancreatic cancer 
in october  we announced the conclusion of the phase i clinical trial of archexin 
we currently estimate that the phase iia trials for pancreatic cancer patients will be completed in the first half of and will require approximately  serdaxin rx serdaxin is an extended release formulation of clavulanic acid  which is an ingredient present in antibiotics approved by the fda 
we are currently developing serdaxin for the treatment of depression and neurodegenerative disorders 
we have recently concluded a phase iia proof of concept clinical trial for major depressive disorder mdd  with serdaxin 
the proof of concept  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled and dose ranging mg  mg  mg administered twice daily phase iia clinical trial enrolled mdd patients at multiple sites in the united states 
no statistical difference was seen between the three doses and the placebo on the montgomery asberg depression rating scale madrs 
a high dropout rate of non responders in the placebo group contributed to a higher than expected response for the placebo treated subjects that completed the study 
we believe this high dropout rate may have contributed to the absence of statistical significance 
in our ad hoc analysis  results from the phase iia clinical trial showed that patients suffering from mdd responded most positively to the mg dose of the drug  and supported proceeding to a phase iib clinical trial 
in the subgroup analysis  the study showed that patients with severe mdd taking mg of serdaxin had significant improvement in madrs  scores after weeks of treatment  compared to the placebo group 
among the patients  patients were classified as having severe mdd 
of the patients treated with mg of serdaxin  madrs scores improved by  compared to only in the placebo group n  which was statistically significant p on an intent to treat basis 
in addition  of patients with severe mdd treated with the mg of serdaxin were considered responders compared to in the placebo group p 
a responder is a patient with a change from baseline madrs score of greater than or equal to after treatment 
additionally  of patients in the treatment group at mg of serdaxin were in remission with a madrs score of less than or equal to after eight weeks of treatment  versus in the placebo group p 
during the trial there were no reports of side effects that are commonly linked to currently marketed antidepressant drugs  such as selective serotonin uptake inhibitors  ssri  serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors  snri  and tricyclic antidepressants tca 
the mg serdaxin treated group adverse events reported fewer adverse events than the placebo group adverse events 
in addition  the mg serdaxin treated group reported a lower dropout rate by week of compared to in the placebo group  and by week the drop out rate for the serdaxin group was only compared to in the placebo group 
pre clinical studies suggest that serdaxin may have an inverted  u shape dose response curve 
this inverted  dose response relationship may explain the observation in the phase iia trial of a more positive response in patients taking the lowest dose 
due to this phenomenon  higher doses of serdaxin may not be effective  suggesting an additional potential benefit with respect to the risk of overdose problems prevalent in other psychogenic medications 
a phase iib trial for mdd with lower doses started recruiting patients in early we are also currently planning the phase ii clinical trial for parkinson s disease pd  with serdaxin and have submitted the protocol for this study to the fda 

index we currently estimate that the phase iib mdd studies will require  through the end of phase ii clinical trials for the use of serdaxin for pd are being developed 
we currently estimate pd studies will require  through the end of zoraxel rx we are developing zoraxel for treatment of erectile dysfunction 
zoraxel is an immediate release formulation of clavulanic acid  the same active ingredient found in our product candidate serdaxin 
the phase iia proof of concept clinical trial of zoraxel is complete with positive results and the phase iib trial will commence in rexahn s decision to move forward with the phase iib trial is supported by data from the phase iia proof of concept  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled and dose ranging mg  mg  mg study of erectile dysfunction patients ages of to treated with zoraxel 
the phase iia study was completed in may and demonstrated that zoraxel consistently improved international index of erectile function  iief  scores of treated subjects 
the phase iia study results showed treatment with mg of zoraxel at week improving subjects iief ef scores by  a value obtained from the changes from the baseline between scores of mg of zoraxel and the placebo group 
furthermore  the study showed among treated subjects a dose dependent treatment effect with improved erectile function and quality of life measures 
the study also showed zoraxel to be well tolerated in the patients in the study with no serious adverse events reported 
to examine the clinical relevance of zoraxel as an erectile dysfunction drug  an effect size analysis has been conducted 
effect size es is a data analysis index developed by dr 
jacob cohen of new york university and is derived from the improvement in iief mean score for the treatment group minus the improvement in iief mean score of the placebo group over the treatment period  divided by the standard deviation of the entire sample at baseline 
an es value greater than is deemed a considerable change under the es criteria 
the es for iief ef and iief intercourse satisfaction indices of zoraxel and  respectively were larger than  suggesting a considerable change in sexual experiences in zoraxel treated patients based on the es criteria 
the phase iib study is designed to assess zoraxel s efficacy in approximately male subjects  ages to  with ed 
the double blind  randomized  placebo controlled  week study will include iief  sexual encounter profile  or sep  penetration sexual intercourse survey  as primary endpoints with and mg doses 
the phase iib study is expected to begin in the second half of and the preliminary data is expected to be available in  subject to the absence of any objection of the fda to the phase iib trial we developed for zoraxel 
the study will be conducted at multiple sites in the united states 

index we currently estimate that these phase iib studies will require approximately  through the end of pre clinical pipeline on september   we closed on a million private placement of our common stock with teva pursuant to a securities purchase agreement 
contemporaneous with the execution and delivery of this agreement  the parties executed a research and exclusive license option agreement relo pursuant to which we are required to use  of the gross proceeds of the issuance and sale of shares to teva to fund a research and development program for the pre clinical development of rx as of december   the proceeds remaining of  is included in restricted cash equivalents 
pursuant to the securities purchase agreement  as amended  teva purchased an additional million of our common stock in a private placement that closed on january  pursuant to the amended securities purchase agreement  teva has the option to acquire additional shares of common stock having a value of  which investment may be made by teva  at its sole discretion  upon satisfactory completion by rexahn of an exploratory early stage clinical study of the compound rx  which study shall be in the location and have protocols that are approved by teva 
during the fourth quarter of  research and development work began on the rx research and development program  which continued throughout these compounds may be entered into exploratory clinical trials in rx is in a late stage preclinical development and the next scheduled program for this compound is a pre clinical toxicology study required prior to submission of an ind application to the fda 
rx  rx  rx nano  rx nano  and nano polymer anticancer drugs are in a preclinical stage of development 
the estimated cost to complete pre clinical toxicology and phase i clinical trials is estimated to be approximately  per each compound 
the conduct of the clinical trial and toxicology studies described above are being accomplished in conjunction with third party clinical research organizations at external locations 
this business practice is typical for the pharmaceutical industry and companies like us 
as a result  the risk of completion or delay of these studies is not within our direct control and a program delay may occur due to circumstances outside our control 
a delay in any of these programs may not necessarily have a direct impact on our daily operations 
however  to the extent that a delay results in additional cost to us  a higher than expected expense may result 
we will need to raise additional money through debt and or equity offerings in order to continue to develop our drug candidates 
if we are not able to raise sufficient additional money  we will have to reduce our research and development activities 
we will first reduce research and development activities associated with our preclinical compounds 
to the extent necessary  we will then reduce our research and development activities related to some or all of our clinical drugs

the closing costs included  warrants  valued at  and recorded as a financing expense 
for the foreseeable future  we will have to fund all of our operations and capital expenditures from the net proceeds of equity and debt offerings we may make  cash on hand  licensing fees and grants 
although we expect to have to pursue additional financing  there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure financing when needed or obtain such financing on terms satisfactory to us  if at all  or that any additional funding we do obtain will be sufficient to meet our needs in the long term 
if we are not able to raise sufficient additional money  we will have to reduce our research and development activities 
we will first reduce research and development activities associated with our preclinical compounds 
to the extent necessary  we will then reduce our research and development activities related to some or all of our clinical drugs 
contractual obligations we have contracted with various vendors to provide research and development services 
the terms of these agreements usually require an initiation fee and monthly or periodic payments over the term of the agreement  ranging from months to months 
the costs to be incurred are estimated and are subject to revision 
as of december   the total contract value of these agreements was approximately  and we made payments totaling  under the terms of the agreements 
all of these agreements may be terminated by either party upon appropriate notice as stipulated in the respective agreements 
on september   we and three of our key executives entered into amended and restated employment agreements 
the amended and restated employment agreements replace the prior employment contracts entered into on august  we entered into the amended and restated employment agreements in order to provide the key executives with i an automatic one year renewal upon the expiration of the initial three year term and upon each consecutive year term unless such employment with the company is terminated earlier by the company or the executives  ii an annual base salary adjustment for inflation as determined by the consumer price index subject to review by the company s compensation committee  iii an increase in the company provided life insurance coverage from an amount equal to two times the executive s annual base salary to an amount equal to four times the executive s annual base salary  and iv a one time cash payment  subject to applicable withholding requirements under applicable state and federal law  in an amount equal to the executive s increased income tax costs as a result of payments made to the executive by the company under the change of control provisions of the amended and restated employment agreement

the initial license fee was  all of which was paid as of december  the agreement with krict calls for a one time milestone payment of  within days after the first achievement of marketing approval of the first commercial product arising out of or in connection with the use of krict s intellectual properties 

index on june   we signed a five year lease for  square feet of office space in rockville  maryland commencing on june  the lease requires annual base rents of  with increases over the next five years 
under the leasing agreement  we pay our allocable portion of real estate taxes and common area operating charges 
we paid  and  for rent under this lease in the years ending december  and  respectively 
future rental payments over the next five years and thereafter are as follows in connection with the lease agreement  we issued a letter of credit of  in favor of the lessor 
we have restricted cash equivalents of the same amount for the letter of credit 
on august   the letter of credit was reduced to  per the lease agreement 
on september   we closed on a securities purchase agreement with teva 
contemporaneous with the execution and delivery of this agreement  the parties executed a research and exclusive license option agreement relo pursuant to which we received  of the gross proceeds of the issuance and sale of shares to teva to fund a research and development program for the pre clinical development of rx at december   we had proceeds remaining of  and have included this amount in restricted cash equivalents 
we will be eligible to receive royalties on net sales of rx worldwide 
research and development work began on the rx research and development program began in the fourth quarter of  and continued throughout on june   we signed a one year renewal to use lab space commencing on july  the lease requires monthly rental payments of  we established a k plan for its employees where we match of the first of the employee s deferral plus of an additional of the employee s deferral 
expense related to this matching contribution aggregated  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 

index current and future financing needs we have incurred negative cash flow from operations since we started our business 
we have spent  and expect to continue to spend  substantial amounts in connection with implementing our business strategy  including our planned product development efforts  our clinical trials  and our research and development efforts 
based on our current plans and our capital resources  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to enable us to meet our minimum planned operating needs through the end of  which would entail focusing our resources on phase ii clinical trials of archexin  serdaxin and zoraxel 
through the end of  we expect to spend a minimum of approximately million on clinical development for phase ii clinical trials of archexin  serdaxin and zoraxel including our commitments described under contractual commitments of this item  million on the development of our pre clinical pipeline  million on general corporate expenses  and  on facilities rent 
we will need to seek additional financing to implement and fund other drug candidate development  clinical trial and research and development efforts to the maximum extent of our operating plan  including in vivo animal and pre clinical studies  phase ii clinical trials for new product candidates  as well as other research and development projects

however  the actual amount of funds we will need to operate is subject to many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the following the progress of our product development activities  the number and scope of our product development programs  the progress of our pre clinical and clinical trial activities  the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we have entered into collaboration agreements  our ability to maintain current collaboration programs and to establish new collaboration arrangements  the costs involved in prosecuting and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the costs and timing of regulatory approvals 
impact of inflation to date inflationary factors have not had a significant effect on our operations
