item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview during  the united states carpet industry sales showed an increase of just under versus the prior year  although  industry sales were lower than their peak in our sales increased approximately in compared with  after a year over year decline of over in the three year period ending in although we anticipate a slow recovery in the united states housing sector and new commercial construction  we believe our business is driven more by resale and remodeling of existing homes and commercial facilities 
while our business was more deeply affected by the downturn as it reached the higher end markets where our business is concentrated  we believe our position in the upper end of the markets has permitted us to benefit from improved conditions and grow our sales at a rate that exceeds the rate of growth of the carpet industry  as and when economic conditions improve 
the positive acceptance of a number of our higher end products and the organizational realignment and costs reduction initiatives we implemented are expected to yield more positive operational performance as evidenced by our results in the fourth quarter of  the first profitable quarter we have experienced since the second quarter of certain raw materials cost have increased in early and we have announced sales price increases to recoup these cost increases 
facility consolidations and cost reduction plans in response to the difficult economic conditions  we developed plans in the fourth quarter of to reduce costs by consolidating our eton  georgia carpet tufting operation into our atmore  alabama tufting  dyeing and finishing facilities  consolidating our santa ana  california tufting operations into our santa ana  california dying  finishing and distribution facility and making organizational and other changes to reduce staff and expenses throughout our company 
the consolidation of our east coast tufting operations was substantially completed in the first quarter of along with the organizational and staff reductions 
the consolidation of our west coast operations was completed during the fourth quarter of these actions better align our operations with current business activity levels and reduce cost 
expenses incurred through for the consolidation and organizational changes associated with the consolidation and cost reduction plan were million since inception in the third quarter of cost recognized included million of costs to consolidate facilities  million of severance and employee relocation expenses and million of costs associated with the exit of our leased facility in santa ana  california 
during  we reassessed the remaining estimated cost for the contractual lease obligation and increased the reserve by thousand based upon current facts and circumstances  primarily due to changes in the sublease assumptions 
the cost associated with the exit of the leased facility may change in the future based on the timing and at what rate we may sublet the facility 
during the third quarter of  we developed and began implementing a plan to realign our organizational structure to further reduce cost and streamline operations 
under the plan  we combined our three residential carpet units into one business with three distinct brands 
as a result  our residential business is organized much like our commercial carpet business and more like the rest of the industry 
costs of this realignment include severance  limited employee relocation expenses  and computer systems conversion expenses required to support the realignment 
the realignment was substantially complete in the fourth quarter of and the remaining components associated with this plan were concluded in the total costs incurred under this plan aggregated to million and included severance pay and employee relocation costs of thousand and computer systems conversion costs of thousand 
during  we incurred additional expense of thousand for additional computer systems conversion cost and employee relocation expenses 
in addition to the facilities consolidations  employee reductions and the organizational realignment  we suspended our match of certain k contributions in and lowered the compensation of our exempt salaried associates in march the k match and the salary reductions remained in effect throughout these actions had a positive impact on our results in and and we believe  along with the restructurings and realignment  have resulted in additional improvements in operational capabilities  increased fixed cost absorption and further facilitated other cost reductions 
salaries were restored to the pre reduction levels in early long lived asset impairments long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
during the fourth quarter of  as we began consolidating certain of our operations and facilities  certain assets were identified  primarily computer systems under development  that would not be utilized going forward 
as a result  we 
table of contents page recorded a non cash  pre tax charge of million to reflect the write off of these assets 
during  we recorded a non cash  pre tax charge of million for long lived asset impairments primarily related to leasehold improvement assets in the california leased facility that  subsequent to the exit of the leased facility  will not provide future economic benefit to the company  other manufacturing related assets that will no longer be used as a result of the california facilities consolidation and additional computer software taken out of service in the systems consolidation process 
goodwill impairment our goodwill was tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events or circumstances indicated that the carrying value of goodwill associated with a reporting unit may not be fully recoverable see note d of our consolidated financial statements related to our goodwill assessment process 
when the annual goodwill impairment test was performed  we reduced our projections for future sales and profitability because economic conditions in the carpet industry had continued to deteriorate 
the measurement resulted in the impairment of all of the goodwill associated with the acquisition of patrick carpet mills  inc in of million and million  or approximately of the goodwill associated with the acquisition of fabrica international  inc in the total non cash goodwill impairment loss recognized in was million 
because economic conditions in the carpet industry deteriorated significantly in the first quarter of  we performed impairment testing of the remaining goodwill associated with our fabrica reporting unit 
the measurement resulted in the impairment of the remaining goodwill associated with the acquisition of fabrica international  inc  accordingly  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment loss of million in the first quarter of there is no goodwill remaining at the end of or results of operations our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with u

table of contents page related to facilities and existing equipment while capital expenditures in were primarily for newly designed manufacturing technology 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million in  while depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately million

in october  we amended and restated our senior loan and security agreement to extend the agreement maturity date from may  to may   decrease the monthly term loan principal installment payments and increase interest rates applicable to borrowings under the agreement to more current market interest rates 
effective january   the amended and restated senior loan and security agreement was further amended to modify certain interest rate definitions to change the relative relationship between base rates and libor rates as used in the agreement and to reduce the applicable credit spreads for base rate loans by 
effective july   we reduced our revolving credit facility from million to million to better align the size of the revolving credit facility with our anticipated levels of accounts receivable and inventory 
our amended and restated senior loan and security agreement provides million of credit  consisting of million of revolving credit and a million term loan 
the term loan is payable in monthly principal installments of thousand and is due may  interest rates available under the amended and restated senior loan and security agreement may be selected from a number of options that effectively allow us to borrow at rates ranging from the lender prime rate plus to the lender prime rate plus for base rate loans  or at rates ranging from libor plus to libor plus for libor loans

the convertible debentures are subordinated in right of payment to all of our other indebtedness 
interest payments for continuing operations were million in  million in  and million in interest capitalized by the company was in and  and thousand in we believe our operating cash flows  credit availability under our senior loan and security agreement and other sources of financing are adequate to finance our normal liquidity requirements 
we will continue to aggressively pursue inventory management  maintain tight cost controls and limit capital expenditures 
however  deterioration in our markets or significant additional cash expenditures above our normal liquidity requirements could require supplemental financing or other funding sources 
there can be no assurance that such supplemental financing or other sources of funding can be obtained or will be

off balance sheet arrangements 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements at december  or december  income tax considerations 
we anticipate that cash outlays for income taxes will not be materially different from our provision for income taxes during the next three fiscal years 
at december   we are in a net deferred tax asset position of thousand 
we performed an analysis  including an evaluation of certain tax planning strategies available to us  related to the net deferred tax asset and believe that the net tax asset is recoverable in future periods  including a thousand federal income tax credit carry forward and federal net operating loss carry forward 
during  we decreased our tax valuation reserve related to future benefits for state net operating loss carry forwards by thousand because the underlying tax assets decreased 
discontinued operations environmental contingencies 
we have reserves for environmental obligations established at five previously owned sites that were associated with our discontinued textile businesses 
each site has a corrective action plan cap with the applicable authoritative state regulatory body responsible for oversight for environmental compliance 
the cap for four of these sites involves natural attenuation degradation of the contaminants through naturally occurring events over periods estimated at to years and the cap on the remaining site involves a pump and treat remediation process  estimated to occur over a period of to years 
we have a reserve of million for environmental liabilities at these sites as of december  additionally  we have a thousand reserve for an environmental liability on the property of a facility and related business that was sold in the cap has a specified remediation term estimated to be years 
the total costs for remediation for all of these sites is expected to be less than thousand annually 
subsequent events 
in february  subsequent to our fiscal year end  an associate sustained a serious work related injury in one of our manufacturing facilities 
we are self insured for workers compensation related injuries with retention for the first thousand and reinsurance coverage beyond such limits 
though we will assess this case and record an estimate of the liability during our first quarter ended april   we anticipate that the cost to be incurred by us will approximate retention limits on our reinsurance 
additionally  we expect to recognize an after tax gain of approximately thousand from insurance proceeds anticipated to be received during the first half of fiscal recent accounting prononuments in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this update requires entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements and provides clarification of existing disclosure requirements 
for assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis  the asu requires disclosure of significant transfers between levels and  and transfers into and out of level of the fair value hierarchy and the reasons for those transfers 
significant transfers into each level must be disclosed and discussed separately from transfers out of each level 
significance is judged with respect to earnings  total assets  total liabilities or total equity 
the asu amends the reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of level recurring fair value measurements to present information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross basis rather than as a net number 
in addition  the asu requires fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities and clarifies that a description of the valuation technique and inputs used to measure fair value is required for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
this standard became effective in  except for the requirement to provide the level activity of purchases  sales  issuances and settlement on a gross basis  which will be effective beginning in the first quarter of because this standard impacts disclosure requirements only  its adoption will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 amendments to certain recognition and disclosure requirements 
this update amends guidance on subsequent events 
this amendment removes the requirement for sec filers to disclose the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events 
however  the date disclosure exemption does not relieve management of an sec filer from its responsibility to evaluate subsequent events through the date on which financial statements are issued 
this standard became effective in first quarter of the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents page critical accounting policies certain estimates and assumptions are made when preparing our financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions affect various matters  including amounts reported for assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at the dates of the financial statements  and amounts reported for revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of operations during the reporting periods presented 
estimates involve judgments with respect to  among other things  future economic factors that are difficult to predict 
as a result  actual amounts could differ from estimates made when our financial statements are prepared 
the securities and exchange commission requires management to identify its most critical accounting policies  defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and the application of which requires our most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments 
although our estimates have not differed materially from our experience  such estimates pertain to inherently uncertain matters that could result in material differences in subsequent periods 
we believe application of the following accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates and represent our critical accounting policies 
other significant accounting policies are discussed in note a to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenues  including shipping and handling amounts  are recognized when the following criteria are met there is persuasive evidence that a sales agreement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
delivery is not considered to have occurred until the customer takes title to products shipped and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership  which is generally on the date of shipment 
at the time revenue is recognized  we record a provision for the estimated amount of future returns based primarily on historical experience and any known trends or conditions 
accounts receivable 
we provide allowances for expected cash discounts  returns  claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical experience and periodic evaluations of the financial condition of our customers 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to significantly deteriorate  or other factors impair their ability to pay their debts  credit losses could differ from allowances recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
customer claims and product warranties 
we provide product warranties related to manufacturing defects and specific performance standards for our products 
we record reserves for the estimated costs of defective products and failure to meet applicable performance standards 
the levels of reserves are established based primarily upon historical experience and our evaluation of pending claims 
because our evaluations are based on historical experience and conditions at the time our financial statements are prepared  actual results could differ from the reserves in our consolidated financial statements 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the last in  first out method lifo  which generally matches current costs of inventory sold with current revenues  for substantially all inventories 
reserves are also established to adjust inventories that are off quality  aged or obsolete to their estimated net realizable value 
additionally  rates of recoverability per unit of off quality  obsolete or excessive inventory are estimated based on historical rates of recoverability and other known conditions or circumstances that may affect future recoverability 
actual results could differ from assumptions used to value our inventory 
self insured accruals 
we estimate costs required to settle claims related to our self insured medical  dental and workers compensation plans 
these estimates include costs to settle known claims  as well as incurred and unreported claims 
the estimated costs of known and unreported claims are based on historical experience 
actual results could differ from assumptions used to estimate these accruals 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory income tax rates that are expected to be applicable in future periods when temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid 
the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of changes in income tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that a change in income tax rates is enacted 
taxing jurisdictions could disagree with our tax treatment of various items in a manner that could affect the tax treatment of such items in the future 
accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using existing laws  rules and regulations  each of which is subject to change 
loss contingencies 
we periodically assess our exposure related to legal matters  environmental matters  product liabilities or any other claims against our assets that may arise in the normal course of business 
if we determine that it is probable a loss has been incurred  the amount of the loss  or an amount within the range of loss  that can be reasonably estimated will be recorded

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in thousands our earnings  cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to interest rates  among other factors 
it is our policy to minimize our exposure to adverse changes in interest rates and manage interest rate risks inherent in funding our company with debt 
we address this financial exposure through a risk management program that includes maintaining a mix of fixed and floating rate debt and the use of interest rate swap agreements 
at december   we were a party to an interest rate swap agreement on our mortgage note payable with a notional amount equal to the outstanding balance of the mortgage note  at december  which expires in march of under the interest rate swap agreement  we pay a fixed rate of interest times the notional amount and receive in return an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional amount 
the swap agreement effectively fixes the interest rate on the mortgage note payable at on october   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of  through may  under this agreement  we paid a fixed rate of interest of times the notional amount and received in return a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional amount 
the interest rate swap agreement was linked to our variable rate debt and was considered a highly effective hedge 
on april   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of  effective may  through may  we did not designate this derivative instrument as a cash flow hedge and as a result recognized the fair value of this instrument in earnings 
under this interest rate swap agreement  we paid a fixed rate of interest of times the notional amount and received in return a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional amount 
due to a significant drop in rates  we terminated the agreement in july and paid a termination fee of which represented the fair value of the instrument 
we entered into another interest rate swap agreement designated as a cash flow hedge with a notional amount of  effective july  through may  under this interest rate swap agreement  we pay a fixed rate of interest of times the notional amount and receive in return a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional amount 
at december    or approximately of our total debt  was subject to floating interest rates 
a fluctuation in the variable interest rates applicable to this floating rate debt would have an annual after tax impact of approximately
