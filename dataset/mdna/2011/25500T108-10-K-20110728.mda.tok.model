overview we provide voice technologies for the telecommunications market 
we design  develop and market telecommunications equipment for use in enhancing voice quality and canceling echo in voice calls over wireline  wireless and internet protocol ip telecommunications networks 
our products monitor and enhance voice quality and provide transcoding in the delivery of voice services 
since entering the voice 
table of contents processing market  we have continued to refine our echo cancellation products to meet the needs of the ever changing telecommunications marketplace 
our tdm based product introductions have leveraged the processing capacity of our newer hardware platforms to offer not only echo cancellation but also enhanced voice quality assurance vqa features including noise reduction  acoustic echo cancellation  voice level control and noise compensation through enhanced voice intelligibility 
we have also introduced products to support carriers that are deploying voice over internet protocol  or voip  technologies which offer all the voice capabilities of our tdm based products along with codec transcoding to meet the new challenges faced by carriers deploying voip technologies 
we also design  develop and market telecommunications software and services 
we have built a software centric extension to our voice quality offerings  named mstage  which provides vqa as well as other voice technologies such as mixing and keyword spotting  enabling the next generation of voice application 
we also market and develop voice to text applications  based on our exclusive reseller agreement with simulscribe 
voice to text utilizes much of the same core expertise in voice processing that underlies vqa 
the current primary market for voice to text is voicemail to text 
in the voicemail to text area we offer a broad spectrum of services  under the brand phonetag  including fully automated transcription services as well as transcription services that include human touch up 
using the same infrastructure we also offer transcription services for conference calls and other audio sources 
we sell our products primarily to wireline and wireless carriers as well as our success in selling to the larger carriers 
we have experienced ebbs and flows in the level of demand from these carriers due to their level of network expansion  adoption of new technologies in their networks and the impacts of merger and other consolidation in the industry 
during the last three years  the downturn in business volume we have experienced seems to have been driven by three main factors technology transitions  budgetary constraints  and the global economic crisis 
the technology transition has impacted us on two fronts 
first and foremost  carriers have been extremely cautious to invest in legacy second generation g technology  historically our primary source of revenue  for fear of stranding some or all of their investments by moving to newer third fourth generation technology g g 
the hesitancy to invest in g equipment has resulted in protracted purchase cycles and smaller deployments to mitigate perceived risks  while still addressing needed improvements in voice quality in g networks 
the second impact has been felt on the g g investment  which has been far slower to develop than was first predicted by industry experts 
instead of wholesale deployment of voip technologies  we have experienced a much more cautious entrance into this technology by many of the carriers with which we have historically done business  with the key by product being that they are buying much smaller systems than would have been expected from their historical buying pattern and in some cases even deciding to limit investment in g technology in lieu of even newer fourth generation technologies that are currently in development 
on the budgetary side  even before the world wide financial crisis became clear  we began to see tighter budgetary spending on capital equipment in many regions of the world  but most importantly with our large domestic customers 
spending on capital equipment appears to have been primarily targeted at equipment that could show a direct correlation with revenue generation as opposed to our historical product offerings  which although not a direct source of revenue for carriers is critical to the overall call experience and therefore to customer satisfaction  which in our opinion can ultimately translate into call revenue 
it is with this capital spending model in mind that we undertook development of our voice service products and mstage which  although leveraging off of our core knowledge of voice technology  we believe will be our first product offering to truly be tied to an identifiable revenue stream for our carriers 
lastly  we believe that the current market conditions around the world have altered the pattern of in purchasing decisions as carriers tighten their capital investment activity due to internal budget 
table of contents constraints and as tighter credit hampers their ability to borrow to facilitate network expansion and or upgrades 
despite the previously mentioned budget constraints and uncertainty around network architecture  we continue to believe that in the united states our continued focus on voice quality in the competitive wireless services landscape and the continued expansion of wireless networks  primarily using g g technologies and to a lesser degree g technologies  will be key factors in our ability to add new customers and drive opportunities for revenue growth 
although we continue to believe that g technology will continue to play a major role in technology utilized in the international regions of the world where we have focused our sales efforts  we do believe that there is a growing interest in certain of these regions in shifting to g technologies 
however  we are poised to support the deployment of our packet voice processor pvp product in g g networks internationally  should demand for the g g technology grow internationally 
the development of our vqa feature set  which was originally targeted at the international global system for mobile communications gsm market  has seen growing importance in the domestic market as well 
we continue to focus sales and marketing efforts on international and domestic mobile carriers that might best apply our vqa solution 
we have continued to invest in customer trials domestically and internationally  where the size of the opportunities justify the costs we must invest in the trial  in an attempt to better avail ourselves of these opportunities as they arise 
between fiscal and early fiscal we directed a significant amount of our research and development spending towards the development of our pvp  a platform targeting voip based network deployments 
the packet voice processor introduces cost effective voice format transcoding capabilities combined with our vqa technology to improve call quality and clarity by eliminating acoustic echo and voice level imbalances and reducing packet loss and jitter 
despite these efforts  we have experienced mixed results as we remain dependant on the buying patterns of a small  yet diverse  group of carriers 
beginning in fiscal  we began shifting our development efforts to other product offerings that leverage off our expertise in voice technology 
one focus of these efforts has been to develop versions of our software that can be used on other vendor platforms that currently do not compete with our products 
more recently we have shifted the majority of our development efforts to our voice service and mstage products  which are nearing the end of their initial development efforts and are being deployed for evaluation at potential customer locations 
while the licensing initiative is typically focused on moving our expertise in voice quality to other types of carrier hardware  voice service products and mstage are designed to enable mobile subscribers to use their voice as well as their thumbs to interact with applications like email  even during a phone call 
in fiscal  we entered into an exclusive worldwide distribution agreement with simulscribe 
in conjunction with this agreement we obtained the exclusive right to market simulscribe voice to text transcription services to customers around the world 
we believe that this voice to text transcription service provides a meaningful complement to the other voice technologies being developed under our mstage product initiatives 
we are undertaking these new opportunities in an effort to not only diversify our product offerings but also our customer base 
we believe that these products could help generate a more predictable revenue base  which we believe is less susceptible to our customer decisions on the timing and nature of the network expansions than our legacy product offerings have experienced on a stand alone basis 
due to softened demand for our products over the last three years  we have undertaken a number of cost cutting measures in an attempt to better align our spending with our revenue levels while still investing in the future of the company by means of development projects  like our voice services products which leverage our core strengths in the voice technology and will hopefully provide for more stable revenue streams in the future 
the focus of our cost cutting efforts has not only been on reducing headcount  which has declined by well over since the end of fiscal  but also on 
table of contents targeted spending reductions on discretionary spending areas such as travel  marketing campaigns and trade shows 
we intend to continue to monitor our spending and intend to take further steps if needed to balance our spending with the revenue opportunities we see ahead of us 
reseller agreement 
in september  we entered into a reseller agreement with simulscribe pursuant to which we became the exclusive reseller of simulscribe voice to text services to wholesale customers 
pursuant to the agreement  we also assumed all of simulscribe wholesale customers 
we paid million and issued a two year promissory note for an additional million for the assumption of the wholesale customer contracts and the exclusivity rights 
in april  the promissory note was paid in full 
additionally  ditech agreed to pay a fee for the services provided by simulscribe  and will pay up to an additional million if the revenues generated from the simulscribe services meet certain performance milestones within the first three years of the agreement the additional payments  subject to acceleration in certain events  such as our failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to market the services or a change of control of our company at a time that revenues from these services are on track to result in the payment ultimately being made 
the additional payments  should any be paid  are convertible into our common stock at simulscribe option 
the additional payments may be converted into our common stock at a conversion price of per share  provided that if a specified revenue target is met then up to million of the additional payments can be converted at per share 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we amended our agreement with simulscribe that extended our exclusive distribution rights to all customers  not just wholesale customers 
the agreement  and the related amendment  were accounted for as an asset acquisition and the value of the consideration given was allocated to the assets received as part of the transaction 
our customer base 
historically  with the exception of fiscal  the majority of our sales have been to customers in the united states 
domestic customers accounted for approximately of our revenue in fiscal  and and of our revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
the geographic mix of revenue reflects domestic demand for our legacy tdm business and our voip business  as well as the vast majority of our voice service product revenue being generated from domestic customers 
our international business for fiscal was primarily concentrated in south east asia 
however  sales to some of our us customers may result in our products purchased by these customers eventually being deployed internationally  especially in the case of any original equipment manufacturer that distributes overseas 
to date  the vast majority of our international sales have been export sales and denominated in us dollars 
our international revenue has been largely driven by demand from customers in south east asia  the middle east and latin america 
we expect our international demand for voice quality products to continue to be heavily influenced by these markets as they are experiencing the highest level of growth and commonly have the most need for cost effective solutions to address voice quality in their growing networks 
however  we expect that international demand for our voice service products may be more heavily influenced by demand from europe and latin america which tend to be earlier adopters of new phone services than other international regions into which we have historically sold product 
our revenue historically has come from a small number of customers 
our largest customer in fiscal and  at t  a domestic wireline and wireless carrier  accounted for approximately and of our revenue  respectively 
our largest customer in fiscal was verizon wireless  which accounted for of revenue 
our five largest customers accounted for approximately of our revenue in fiscal and and of our revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
consequently  the loss of  or significant decline in purchases by  any one of our largest customers  without an offsetting increase in revenue from existing or new customers  would have a substantial negative effect on our business 
this customer concentration risk was evidenced over the last few fiscal years as sudden delays and or declines in purchases by our large customers resulted in significant declines in our overall revenues and ultimately resulted in net losses for those periods 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to our revenue recognition  investments  inventory valuation allowances  cost of warranty  impairment of long lived assets  accounting for stock based compensation and accounting for income taxes 
estimates are based on our historical experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual future results may differ from these estimates in the event that facts and circumstances vary from our expectations 
if and when adjustments are required to reflect material differences arising between our ongoing estimates and the ultimate actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in applying our revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts policies the level of judgment is generally relatively limited  as the vast majority of our revenue has been generated by a handful of relatively long standing customer relationships 
these customers are some of the largest wire line and wireless carriers in the world and our relationships with them are documented in contracts  which clearly highlight potential revenue recognition issues  such as passage of title and risk of loss 
as of april   we had deferred million of revenue 
however  only to the extent that we have received cash for a given deferred revenue transaction is the deferred revenue recorded on the consolidated balance sheets 
to the extent that we have not collected cash related to the deferred revenue transaction  we reflect the deferred revenue as a reduction in the corresponding account receivable balance 
of the million of total deferred revenue transactions at april   million had been collected from customers and therefore million was reported as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet and the other million was reflected as a reduction in account receivables 
of the million of revenue deferred as of april   substantially all of it was associated with maintenance contracts  which are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  typically twelve months 
in dealing with the remaining smaller customers  we closely evaluate the credit risk of these customers 
in those cases where credit risk is deemed to be high  we either mitigate the risk by having the customer post a letter of credit  which we can draw against on a specified date  to effectively provide reasonable assurance of collection  or we defer the revenue until customer payment is received 
investments we consider investment securities that have maturities of more than three months at the date of purchase but remaining maturities of less than one year  and auction rate securities  which we have historically settled on  or day auction cycles  as short term investments 
however  when auction rate securities failed to settle at auction  which occurred since the middle of fiscal through  and conditions leading to their failure to auction create uncertainty as to whether they will settle in the near term  we have classified them as long term consistent with the contractual term of the underlying security 
long term investment securities include any investments with remaining maturities of one year or more and auction rate securities for which we are unable to estimate when they will settle 
short term and long term investments consist primarily of certificates of deposit and preferred equity securities 
we have classified our investments as available for sale securities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we carry available for sale securities at fair value  and report unrealized gains and losses as a separate component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities  if any  are included in other income  net based on specific identification 
we include interest on securities classified as available for sale in total other income 
see also the discussion in liquidity and capital resources below for additional information on auction rate securities 

table of contents inventory valuation allowances in conjunction with our ongoing analysis of inventory valuation  we constantly monitor projected demand on a product by product basis 
based on these projections we evaluate the levels of write downs required for inventory on hand and inventory on order from our contract manufacturers 
although we believe we have been reasonably successful in identifying write downs in a timely manner  sudden changes in buying patterns from our customers  either due to a shift in product interest and or a complete pull back from their expected order levels has resulted in the recognition of larger than anticipated write downs 
for example  we recorded inventory write downs for excess levels of inventory  due to wholesale shifts in demand  of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
sales of previously written down inventory during the fiscal  and were not material 
cost of warranty at the time that we recognize revenue  we accrue for the estimated costs of the warranty we offer on our products 
we currently offer warranties on the hardware elements of our products ranging from one to five years and warranties on the software elements of our products ranging from days to one year 
the warranty generally provides that we will repair or replace any defective product and provide software bug fixes within the term of the warranty 
our accrual for the estimated warranty is based on our historical experience and expectations of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  we may revise our estimated warranty accrual to reflect these additional exposures 
this would result in a decrease in gross profits 
as of april  and  we had million and million  respectively  accrued related to estimated future warranty costs 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that carrying amounts of long lived assets  including intangible assets  may not be recoverable 
when such events or changes in circumstances arise  we assess the recoverability of our long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets in question  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our amortizable purchased intangible assets based on an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use of the related asset group and its eventual disposition 
the asset group represents the lowest level for which cash flows are largely independent of cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we report long lived assets to be disposed of at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
during fiscal  and  we recorded impairment charges of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the impairment charges in result from damaged equipment that has been written off 
fiscal and charges were associated with certain identifiable assets that were abandoned as a result of the cumulative effects of the reduction in force that had been implemented in those years 
accounting for stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award fair value as calculated by the black scholes merton black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense  net of estimated forfeitures  ratably over the requisite service period 
given our employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options and  because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value  in our opinion the existing valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
although we determine the fair value of employee stock options using the black scholes option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed between a willing buyer and a willing seller in a market transaction 
the black scholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected option life and volatility 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes model or the estimated forfeiture 
table of contents rate changes significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
accounting for income taxes amounts recorded for income taxes  both current and deferred  are based on estimates of the tax consequences of our operations in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
our deferred taxes are the result of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items such as valuation allowances for bad debts and inventory  for tax and accounting purposes 
as part of our ongoing assessment of the recoverability of our deferred tax assets  on a quarterly basis we review the expiration dates of our net operating loss and research credit carry forwards 
in addition  we complete a study on the impact of section of the internal revenue code on at least a semi annual basis to determine whether a change in ownership may limit the value of our net operating loss carry forwards 
we determined that a full valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets beginning as of april  was required 
we have considered all evidence  positive and negative  and believe that based on our recent operating losses and uncertainty about the magnitude and timing of future operating profits  it is no longer more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
we have adopted the accounting guidance relative to accounting for uncertainties in income taxes 
this guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this guidance also provides guidance on derecognition of tax benefits  classification on the balance sheet  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
we have classified interest and penalties as a component of tax expense 
we do not expect a significant change to the liability for uncertain tax positions over the next months 
we are currently not under audit for any years or in any jurisdictions 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these types of examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
recent accounting guidance not effective in or prior to fiscal in october  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on revenue recognition that will become effective for us beginning may   with earlier adoption permitted 
under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements  tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product will no longer be within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance  and software enabled products will now be subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance 
additionally  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance 
under the new guidance  when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined  a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
the new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
we are currently assessing the potential effect  if any  on our financial statements 
in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new authoritative guidance on the milestone method of revenue recognition 
the milestone method applies to research and development arrangements in which one or more payments are contingent upon achieving uncertain future events or circumstances 
this guidance defines a milestone and provides criteria for determining whether the milestone method is appropriate 
this standard is effective for milestones achieved in fiscal years beginning on or after june   on a prospective basis  with earlier application permitted 
as we are typically not a party to research and development arrangements  we believe this standard will not have a material impact on our financial statements 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated results of operations years ended april  revenue cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative amortization of purchased intangible assets total operating expenses operating loss total other income expense  net loss before benefit from income taxes benefit from income taxes net loss discussion of fiscal years ended april    and revenue years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands revenue change the decrease in revenue of million in fiscal compared to fiscal was largely due to a decrease in revenue from our top five customers 
for year ended april   our top five customers accounted for million of revenue as compared to million for the corresponding period in fiscal the decline in sales to the top five customers was largely due to continued soft sales in international markets 
this decrease was offset by approximately a million increase in revenue from our voice service offerings 
although we believe that we have a number of meaningful opportunities for our legacy products  the process to convert these opportunities to revenue continues to be protracted and volatile 
as our legacy product business is characterized by a relatively small number of high value transactions per quarter  the shift in the timing of a single transaction can materially impact our revenue for a period 
we believe purchasing delays are occurring for a number of different reasons including but not limited to tight capital budgets requiring our domestic customers to reprioritize their capital purchases and international sales being impacted by changes in local regulations and changes in the management involved in the decision approval process for our product  both of which have contributed to delays in our ability to close deals 

table of contents the increase in revenue in fiscal from fiscal was largely due to an increase in domestic deployments of both our bvp flex and our pvp systems  as well as initial sales attributable to our voice services products  primarily transcription services 
these increases were partially offset by declines in our international business primarily from customers in south east asia and the middle east  as changes in customer management and the shift in capital spending focus away from call quality to other aspects of their networks resulted in reduced deployments of product in these regions 
in the aggregate  our top five customers in fiscal accounted for million of our total revenue as compared to the top five customers in fiscal  which accounted for million 
the increase in revenue from our largest customer in fiscal  at t  a provider of domestic wireline  wireless and conferencing communications services  which accounted for of revenue in fiscal versus of revenue in fiscal  was largely due to targeted upgrades of portions of their g networks  as well as upgrades to portions of their voip conferencing network 
partially offsetting this increase  we experienced a decrease in revenue from verizon  our second largest customer in fiscal  both in real terms and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal compared to in fiscal 
this decline was driven by the declines in service contract revenue from verizon  as it reduced the level of maintenance services for its installed base of equipment 
this decline in maintenance revenue was only partially offset by increased deployment activity of new systems in fiscal we had one other customer that accounted for over of revenue in fiscal  a voip conferencing provider  which accounted for approximately of revenue in fiscal as compared to approximately of revenue in fiscal our domestic revenue for fiscal was of worldwide revenue as compared to in fiscal the increase in our domestic revenue was due in part to the increase in domestic sales of our bvp flex products domestically and the increase voice services revenue  which to date has been largely driven by domestic customers 
revenue over the last several fiscal years has been generated largely from domestic sales 
our international sales have primarily been dependent on our success in selling vqa 
although we continue to believe that there are meaningful international revenue opportunities  we continue to experience volatility in purchasing cycles from our existing and prospective international customers  which has resulted in volatility in the level of international revenue from quarter to quarter 
most recently potential changes in india import regulations related to technology based products contributed to delays in our ability to close orders in that region  as we worked to understand the implication of the potential rule changes on our products and to ensure that our intellectual property was adequately protected 
we plan to continue to invest in customer trials to attempt to capture the international revenue opportunities that exist for us 
although we have experienced a consistent number of customers representing greater than of our revenues during fiscal  and  the overall dollar magnitude of the revenue from these customers continues to reflect the soft market conditions for our products  as buying decisions continue to be slow to materialize and are generally for more conservative amounts than buying patterns experienced in years prior to we believe that this protracted buying process and the smaller ordering levels are a function of tighter capital spending budgets and tighter credit markets  as well as uncertainty in the technical direction that companies are looking to take 
this indecision around future network design appears to have made carriers leery to invest heavily in legacy circuit switched technology due to the risk of stranding investments upon conversion to newer network technologies such as voip 
however  on the voip side we are experiencing carriers moving into the voip space in a more conservative manner than was expected by industry analysts  resulting in deployments at a fraction of the size that we are accustomed to seeing for circuit switched network deployments 
the smaller scale version of the pvp  which was released in the fourth quarter of fiscal  has resulted in additional revenue opportunity but has produced mixed sales results  accounting for of revenue in  of revenue in fiscal  and of revenues in fiscal 
table of contents we have found that carriers appear to be focused on both voip and legacy circuit switched technology  depending on their customer needs and market opportunity 
revenue levels for fiscal will be dependent on our success in adding new customers domestically and internationally  the network technology and deployment plans of the north american telecommunication service providers  the market acceptance of our pvp  and the timing and market acceptance of our voice services products 
see item a risk factors for discussions of risks related to customer concentration and other factors  which could impact the timing and level of revenue 
see our cautionary language in the first paragraph of item business regarding forward looking statements such as the statements made in the prior paragraphs about our expectations regarding our future revenue  as well as statements regarding our expectations in each of the categories below 
cost of goods sold and gross margin years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands cost of goods sold change gross profit gross margin pts pts cost of goods sold consists of direct material costs  personnel costs for test  configuration and quality assurance  costs of licensed technology incorporated into our products  post sales installation costs  subcontracted service provider costs associated with our voice services products  provisions for inventory and warranty expenses and other indirect costs 
the decrease in cost of goods sold in the year ended april  as compared to the year ended april   was driven by a number of factors 
the decrease in business volume for our legacy voice quality products accounted for approximately million of the decline 
additionally  there was a decrease in errors and omissions reserves of million  a reduction in headcount and related expenses of million  and a decrease in warranty and installation costs of million  also related to the decline in business 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in costs associated with the increase in voice services volume 
cost of goods sold remained relatively constant from fiscal to fiscal as a million decline in write downs of excess inventory and million of reduced costs associated with installation and customer service costs due to reductions in force and other cost containment measures  more fully discussed below in the discussion of gross margin  was substantially offset by increased costs associated with increased product shipments and costs associated with our voice services product revenues 
our analysis of gross margin percentage below discusses the other factors driving changes in cost of goods sold 
our gross margin percentage remained relatively constant from the year ended april  to with a decrease of or approximately a million decrease in gross profit 
this change is comprised primarily of a decrease in business volume for our legacy voice quality products  which accounted for a decrease of approximately million of gross profit  or approximately percentage points of gross margin percentage 
this was partially offset by a million increase in gross profit associated with the increase in voice services volume 
our gross margin percentage increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  largely due to a decline in the level of excess inventory write downs recognized in fiscal as compared to fiscal in fiscal  we experienced a fundamental shift in demand for two of our products which resulted in a million reserve being recognized 
this compares to a more normalized level of excess 
table of contents inventory write downs being recognized in fiscal of million 
the resulting million decline in write downs of excess inventory accounted for approximately ten percentage points of margin improvement  year over year 
in addition  we experienced approximately million of reduced costs associated with installation and customer service costs due to reductions in force and other cost containment measures  which represented an additional three percentage points of improved margin 
these improvements in gross margin percentage were partially offset by increased unit shipments of product at slightly lower standard margins  due to product and customer mix  and increased costs associated with our voice services revenue  which combined to result in a two percentage point decrease in the gross margin percentage 
all other things being equal  we expect that if our revenue levels increase  gross margin percentages should improve from the current levels as the continued under absorption of manufacturing overheads will become a smaller percentage of a larger revenue base  resulting in improved margins 
however  we could experience declines in our gross margin due to further pricing pressures as we expand the distribution of our products internationally through value added resellers and distributors  which typically demand lower prices than end user customers to allow for a profit to be realized on their resale 
we may also experience a decline in gross margin if our lower margin voice services products become a larger percentage of our overall revenue 
sales and marketing years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands sales and marketing expense of revenue pts pts sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  including commissions and costs associated with customer service  travel  trade shows and outside consulting services 
the decrease in sales and marketing expense for the year ended april  as compared to the year ended april  was largely due to attrition in the sales and marketing organizations resulting in part from a reduction in force that occurred during the latter part of fiscal the resulting reduction in headcount had a direct impact on base pay  variable compensation  and consulting expense  which experienced a combined reduction of approximately million 
other headcount related expenses including travel and tradeshows accounted for an additional decrease in expense of approximately million  which was partially offset by an increase in voice services amortization expense of approximately million 
the decline in sales and marketing spending in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was largely due to realizing the benefit of the reductions in force put in place in fiscal and  as well as other cost control steps taken in fiscal and the last six months of fiscal as a result of these measures  we experienced a million reduction in payroll and related costs and a million decrease in travel  trade shows and consulting spending 
in addition  we experienced a million decline in the level of agent fees incurred largely due to decline in revenue from customers in the middle east 
lastly  the costs associated with our reduction in force efforts declined million in fiscal see the discussion of reduction in force below 
partially offsetting these decreases was a million increase in variable compensation due to higher sales levels in fiscal we expect that our sales and marketing expenses in fiscal will increase modestly from fiscal levels due to a planned increase in headcount to develop new sales opportunities for our voice services product line 

table of contents research and development years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands research and development expense of revenue pts pts research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel costs  contract consultants  materials and supplies used in the development of voice processing products 
in fiscal research and development costs decreased by million  which consists primarily of a million decrease in headcount and consulting expense 
additionally  there was a million decrease in depreciation expense due to an increase in fully depreciated assets  and a million reduction primarily derived from a decrease in research and development tools and software seats 
the decline in fiscal research and development spending was largely due to realizing the benefit of the reductions in force put in place in fiscal and  as well as other cost control steps 
as a result of these measures  we experienced a million reduction in payroll and related costs and a million decrease in travel and other spending 
in addition  we experienced a million decline in depreciation due to assets being becoming fully depreciated and retired and a million decline in reduction in force costs in fiscal see the discussion of reduction in force below 
partially offsetting these decreases was a million increase in consulting costs to supplement our internal development efforts 
we expect to continue to see a decrease in our research and development spending in fiscal as we continue to implement cost savings measures 
general and administrative years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands general and administrative expense of revenue pts pts general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs for corporate officers  finance and human resources personnel  as well as insurance  legal  accounting and consulting costs 
the decrease in fiscal general and administrative expense reflects a decrease in compensation  benefit and headcount related expense of approximately million 
additionally  audit fees were reduced approximately million 
the decline in spending in fiscal is largely due to realizing the benefit of the reductions in force put in place in fiscal  as well as other cost control steps taken over fiscal and the last six months of fiscal as a result of these measures  we experienced a million reduction in payroll and related costs 
in addition  we experienced a million decline in legal costs related to favorable resolution of all outstanding legal matters as of the end of fiscal and reductions in outside services and insurance costs aggregating million 
in addition  we experienced a million decline in reduction in force related expenses primarily associated with the fiscal estimated sublease loss recorded related to vacating a portion of our mountain view headquarters 
we expect general and administrative expenses in fiscal to be flat to modestly down as we continue to closely control spending 

table of contents amortization of purchased intangible assets years ended april  s in thousands amortization of purchased intangible assets of revenue for the years ended april   and  we recorded amortization of purchased intangible assets related to acquisitions we made in fiscal and we are amortizing purchased intangible assets to operating expense over their estimated useful lives which range from three to five years 
the increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets in fiscal over fiscal is due the realization of a full year of amortization expense related to voice serve products in fiscal  versus only a partial year in fiscal the reduction in amortization of purchased intangible assets in fiscal from fiscal was due to the impairment of purchased intangible assets at the end of fiscal see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense recognized in fiscal  and was as follows years ended april  in thousands cost of goods sold sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total the decline in stock based compensation over the last two fiscal years is due to two key factors 
first and foremost is the reduction in options outstanding and therefore stock based compensation linked to the reductions in force that occurred since the end of the second quarter of fiscal the second key element of the decline is linked to the composition of the pool of options for which compensation is being recognized 
as compensation related to older options  which were granted at higher fair values per share due to the stock price at the time of grant  becomes fully amortized  it is being replaced by compensation related to newer option grants which are being issued at lower fair values due to the decline in our stock price 
we expect to continue to experience a declining level of expense related to stock based compensation 
reduction in force and other charge years ended april  in thousands cost of goods sold sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total 
table of contents in november  we completed a reduction in force in an attempt to continue to reduce operating expenses 
as a result of this reduction in force  we reduced our workforce by approximately 
in addition in december  we completed the sublease of office space vacated in fiscal and we identified additional impairments of fixed assets  which had become idle as a result of the reduction in force 
as a result of these activities  we recognized a charge in the third quarter of fiscal of approximately million 
all individuals impacted by the reduction in headcount were notified of the termination of their employment in november in fiscal  the company recognized a charge of million for severance related to a reduction in force overseas  net of estimated outplacement services originally recorded as a part of the restructuring in the third quarter of fiscal  which expired unused in the third quarter of fiscal as of april   substantially all of the remaining balance in the accrual for the reductions in force of  relates to the estimated loss associated with subleasing vacated space in our mountain view headquarters 
in fiscal  we incurred a charge of million related to the reductions in force and related charges  undertaken in the second and third quarters of fiscal  in an effort to reduce spending levels to coincide with the more recent declines we had experienced in our revenue 
these reductions in force resulted in a reduction in headcount during fiscal as a result of the cumulative reductions in force since the second quarter of fiscal  the charges for fiscal included the estimated costs to vacate approximately of the space in our mountain view headquarters and the cost associated with abandoning certain idled fixed assets  resulting in charges of million and million  respectively 
all severance payments associated with the fiscal reductions in force have been paid 
during the second quarter of fiscal   of severance benefits related to outplacement services expired unused and were reversed to the same financial lines to which they were originally recorded in fiscal total other income expense  net years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands total other income expense  net of revenue pts pts total other income expense  net generally consists of interest income on our invested cash and cash equivalents and investment balances  offset by other than temporary impairment losses on investment securities  interest on convertible debt and a nominal amount of foreign exchange losses 
in fiscal  other income also reflects a one time settlement related to a financial instrument of million 
certain legal fees related to the settlement were also charged to other income  and partially offset the amount collected 
the decrease in total other expense  net in fiscal is due to a decline in the level of impairment charges recognized related to our auction rate security holdings in fiscal as compare to fiscal  partially offset by reduced interest income due to lower yields on invested cash and lower cash balances and increased interest expense associated with the convertible note issued in fiscal as part of the simulscribe distribution agreement see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our fiscal other income expense  net will be dependent on our cash balances and the movement of us interest rates 

table of contents benefit from income taxes years ended april  increase decrease from prior year s in thousands benefit from income taxes of revenue pts pts income taxes consist of federal  state and foreign income taxes 
the tax benefit for fiscal  and resulted in an effective rate of less than 
this rate was largely impacted by the continued recording of full valuation allowances against the future tax benefits from the net operating losses generated during the year 
the other factors impacting the effective tax rate were modest levels of international and state taxes  which are not directly tied to our overall operating loss but rather to the level of profitability in these tax jurisdictions 
until such time as we are able to reverse the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  we expect the effective tax rate to be at or close to and be associated with minor levels of taxes for certain state and foreign jurisdictions 
liquidity and capital resources as of april   and  we had cash and cash equivalents and investments totaling million  million and million  respectively 
as of april   we had cash and cash equivalents of million as compared to million at april  and million as of april  as of april   we had million of short term investments as compared to million and million as of april  and  respectively 
at april   and  we also had million  million and million of preferred equity securities  which had been classified as long term investments consistent with the maturities of the securities underlying the instruments  due to uncertainty as to when they may settle 
the decline in our cash and investment balances over the last two years is in large part due to million and million of cash used by operations due to our operating losses during fiscal and  respectively 
additionally  in fiscal we made a cash payment of million for the acquisition of simulscribe distribution rights  and in fiscal a promissory note payable to simulscribe totaling million was paid in full 
in april  we received million in proceeds from a one time settlement related to a financial instrument 
as of april   all of our short term and long term investments were held in certificates of deposit and asset backed preferred equity securities 
the long term investments are tied to auction rate securities that failed to settle at auction beginning in fiscal  for which there appears to be no near term market 
although these securities would normally be classified as short term  as they typically settle every days  they have been reclassified to long term pending them settling at auction 
as of april   we continued to hold preferred equity securities with a par value of million and a carrying value of million 
we have a million line of credit facility with our bank  which expires on july  we are currently in negotiations with the bank to renew the line of credit 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the line of credit as of april  as of april   we were in compliance with its financial covenants 
for the last three years  we have satisfied the majority of our liquidity requirements through cash flow generated from operations  funds received upon exercise of stock options and the proceeds from our public offerings in fiscal 
table of contents net cash flows from operating activities years ended april  increase decrease from prior year in thousands net cash used in operating activities the negative cash flows from operations are generally associated with the operating losses reported over the last three fiscal years due in large part to the soft demand for our products during this period of time 
in fiscal  the cash used in operations was partially offset by the receipt of a million settlement related to a financial instrument 
although we have been successful in reducing our operating expenses by means of reductions in our workforce and tighter control over discretionary spending during the last three years  the reductions have not been sufficient to return us to profitability and positive operating cash flows 
through our efforts to reduce our spending on operating expenses  we believe that as we have been able to create an environment in which our legacy business in the tdm and voip communications equipment are operating at near cash flow break even and that the level of cash used in operations is primarily linked to the investments we are making in our new voice services products 
our day sales outstanding were approximately days at both april  and we expect to see continued modest levels of negative cash flows from operations in the coming year based on expected continued softness in revenue  while continuing to invest in our new voice services products 
however  we expect the level of negative cash flows from operations in fiscal to improve slightly from the levels experienced fiscal as we realize the savings from our most recent cost containment efforts  and as we continue to focus on cost controls and work down our inventory levels 
net cash flows from investing activities years ended april  increase decrease from prior year in thousands net cash provided by used in investing activities in fiscal we invested primarily in short term certificates of deposit 
the decrease in cash used for investing activities during the year was primarily due to liquidations exceeding new investments purchased during the year  a reflection of our continuing losses resulting in less cash available for investment 
we also used million cash to make payment on a promissory note in fiscal additionally  we made only a nominal investment in property and equipment in fiscal the increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal is from two primary causes 
the first is that in fiscal we liquidated a significant portion of our auction rate security positions 
although we did liquidate one additional auction rate security in fiscal  the level of activity declined sharply year over year 
this  coupled with our entering into the exclusive distribution agreement with simulscribe  which used million of cash and our move back into short term certificate of deposit investments in fiscal contributed to substantially all the change 
we plan to continue to invest in modest levels of capital assets primarily in support of our new product development efforts 

table of contents net cash flows from financing activities years ended april  increase decrease from prior year in thousands net cash provided by financing activities the limited cash flow from financing activities in fiscal  and was due to the limited level of option exercises during those years largely due to a large portion of the options being out of the money or only marginally in the money due to the decline in our stock price 
we expect that cash flows from financing activities will continue to reflect negligible levels of stock option exercises due to the current price of our stock 
commitments we have no material commitments other than obligations under operating leases  particularly our facility lease  normal purchases of inventory  capital equipment and operating expenses  such as materials for research and development and consulting 
we also have an earn out obligation under the simulscribe agreement  which could be as much as million depending on the level of revenues achieved during the year term of the agreement 
on april   we leased approximately  square feet of space in the two buildings that form our mountain view  california headquarters  which lease term runs through july  in fiscal  we executed a sublease of approximately  square feet of our mountain view headquarters  which we vacated in fiscal due to reduced space needs as a result of the cumulative effect of the reductions in force that we have completed since the second quarter of fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we signed a six month extension through january   on approximately  square feet of our mountain view headquarters to allow us to more fully explore our space requirements and facility options 
our remaining lease obligation as of april   was approximately million net of sublease payments 
we believe that we will be able to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next twelve to eighteen months from our existing cash and short term investments 
the ability to fund our operations beyond the next twelve to eighteen months will depend on the overall demand of telecommunications providers for new capital equipment 
should we continue to experience significantly reduced levels of customer demand for our products compared to historical levels of purchases  we could need to find additional sources of cash during the latter part of fiscal or be forced to further reduce our spending levels to protect our cash reserves 
off balance sheet arrangements as of april   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item of sec regulation s k
