forward looking statements the information in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  except for the historical information  contains forward looking statements 
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and to the cautionary statement set forth below 
these forward looking statements could differ materially from actual results 
the company assumes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revision or updates to these forward looking statements to reflect future events or unanticipated occurrences 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto  which are included elsewhere in this report 
key operating factors key factors  which management believes have the largest impact on the overall results of operations of entegris  inc  include level of sales since a significant portion of the company s product costs except for raw materials  purchased components and direct labor are largely fixed in the short to medium term  an increase or decrease in sales affects gross profits and overall profitability significantly 
also  increases or decreases in sales and operating profitability affect certain costs such as incentive compensation and commissions  which are highly variable in nature 
the company s sales are subject to effects of industry cyclicality  technological change and substantial competition  including pricing pressures and foreign currency fluctuations 
variable margin on sales the company s variable margin on sales is determined by selling prices and the costs of manufacturing and raw materials 
this is also affected by a number of factors  which include the company s sales mix  purchase prices of raw material especially resin and purchased components  competition  both domestic and international  direct labor costs  and the efficiency of the company s production operations  among others 
fixed cost structure increases or decreases in sales have a large impact on profitability 
there are a number of large fixed or semi fixed cost components  which include salaries  indirect labor and benefits  facility costs  lease expense  and depreciation and amortization 
it is not possible to vary these costs easily in the short term as volumes fluctuate 
thus changes in sales volumes can affect the usage and productivity of these cost components and can have a large effect on the company s results of operations 
overall summary of financial results for the year ended december  the company s financial results for the year ended december  reflected the continuation of the recovery from the global economic recession and  more specifically  the severe downturn in both the capital and unit driven segments of the semiconductor industry that began during the second half of the year ended december  the company s business downturn reached a trough during the first quarter of in the second quarter of  the company began to experience an upturn in bookings and sales of certain of its unit driven  consumable products and recovery of the company s capital driven product lines began in the third quarter 
from a low point of million in the first quarter of  sales of the company s products and services rose steadily to million  million and million in the second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
quarterly sales increased to million  million  million and million in total net sales for the year ended december  were million  up million  or  from sales of million for the year ended december  sales growth in reflected continued positive trends in the company s core semiconductor markets 
each of the company s three operating segments experienced significant net sales increases 
the sales increase in included favorable foreign currency translation effects of million related to the year over year strengthening of most international currencies versus the us dollar  most notably the japanese yen  korean won  singaporean dollar and taiwanese dollar  offset partly by a weaker euro 
the sales increase for also included sales of million from the company s pureline subsidiary  which was acquired in july excluding these factors  net sales rose approximately in when compared to the company reported considerably higher gross profit and an improved gross margin for compared to the gross margin rate for was compared to for  mainly reflecting the significant year over year sales increase and the associated improvement in factory utilization 
the company had higher year over year selling  general and administrative sg a and engineering  research and development er d costs for the year ended december  when compared to a year ago  primarily due to increased employee related costs related to higher incentive costs and the absence of the temporary pay reductions and unpaid furloughs put in place in as temporary cost saving measures 
as a result of the factors noted above  net earnings attributable to the company were million  or per diluted share  for compared to a net loss attributable to the company of million  or per diluted share  in during  the company amended its revolving credit facility agreement 
the amendments reduced the revolving credit commitment from million to million 
in addition  the amendments provided greater flexibility for certain thresholds related to the company s capital expenditures and cash management covenants 
the amendments did not change the cash flow leverage ratio or fixed charge coverage ratio covenants included in the terms of the revolving credit facility 
as of december   the company had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and was in compliance with all applicable debt covenants included in the terms of the revolving credit facility 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for additional detail 
during  the company s operating activities provided cash flow of million  allowing the company to reduce its outstanding debt by million 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december  compared with million at december  the company had no outstanding short term bank borrowings or long term debt at december  compared with debt of million at december  critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
at each balance sheet date  management evaluates its estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to accounts receivable  warranty and sales return obligations  inventories  long lived assets  income taxes  and shared based compensation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the critical accounting policies affected most significantly by estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are discussed below 
accounts receivable related valuation accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts and for sales returns and allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing these valuation accounts 
if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates  this could result in material differences in the amount and timing of the company s results of operations for any period 
in addition  actual results could be different from the company s current estimates  possibly resulting in increased future charges to earnings 
the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts for all individual receivables judged to be unlikely for collection 
for all other accounts receivable  the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors 
specifically  management considers the age of receivable balances  historical bad debt write off experience and current economic circumstances when determining its allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
an allowance for sales returns and allowances is established based on historical and current trends in product returns 
at december  and  the company s reserve for sales returns and allowances was million and million  respectively 
inventory valuation the company uses certain estimates and judgments to properly value inventory 
in general  the company s inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market value 
the company evaluates its ending inventories for obsolescence and excess quantities each quarter 
this evaluation includes analyses of inventory levels  historical write off trends  expected product lives  and sales levels by product 
inventories that are considered obsolete are written off or a full allowance is recorded 
in addition  allowances are established for inventory quantities in excess of forecasted demand 
inventory allowances were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company s inventories include materials and products subject to technological obsolescence  which are sold in highly competitive industries 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than current conditions or the company s planned outlook for improved sales levels  additional inventory write downs or allowances may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
impairment of long lived assets as of december   the company had million of net property  plant and equipment and million of net intangible assets 
the company routinely considers whether indicators of impairment of the value of its long lived assets  particularly its manufacturing equipment  and its intangible assets  are present 
a long lived asset asset group shall be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances triggering events indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the following are examples of such events or changes in circumstances a 
a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset asset group b 
a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset asset group is being used or in its physical condition c 
a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset asset group  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator d 
an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset asset group e 
a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset asset group f 
a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
if such indicators are present  it is determined whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the asset group in question is less than its carrying value 
if less  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its respective fair value 
fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows  appraisals or other methods deemed appropriate 
if the asset groups determined to be impaired are to be held and used  the company recognizes an impairment charge to the extent the fair value attributable to the asset group is less than the assets carrying value 
the fair value of the assets then becomes the assets new carrying value  which is depreciated or amortized over the remaining estimated useful life of the assets 
the company s long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level asset groups for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
the company has four significant asset groups  identified by assessing the company s identifiable cash flows and the interdependence of such cash flows contamination control solutions ccs  micro environments me  poco graphite poco and entegris specialty coatings esc 
as described above  the evaluation of the recoverability of long lived assets requires the company to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to  the identification of the asset group at the lowest level of independent cash flows and the primary asset of the group and long range forecasts of revenue and costs  reflecting management s assessment of general economic and industry conditions  operating income  depreciation and amortization and working capital requirements 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates  actual results could differ from those estimates 
in addition  changes in the underlying assumptions would have a significant impact on the conclusion that an asset group s carrying value is recoverable  or the determination of any impairment charge if it was determined that the asset values were indeed impaired 
in connection with triggering events during the third and fourth quarters of and the first quarter of  the company reviewed its long lived assets and determined that none of its long lived assets were impaired for its asset groups 
the determination was based on reviewing estimated undiscounted cash flows for the company s asset groups  which were greater than their carrying values 
based on improved economic conditions within the semiconductor industry and the absence of any other triggering events  the company has not been required to perform impairment testing for any of its asset groups since the first quarter of the company will continue to monitor circumstances and events to determine whether asset impairment testing is warranted 
it is possible that in the future the company may no longer be able to conclude that there is no impairment of its long lived assets  nor can the company provide assurance that material impairment charges of long lived assets will not occur in future periods 
income taxes in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company has significant amounts of deferred tax assets 
management reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability on a quarterly basis and assesses the need for valuation allowances 
management considers the positive and negative evidence for the potential utilization of its deferred tax assets 
when management concludes that it is not more likely than not that the company will realize certain deferred tax assets in the future  it records a valuation allowance for the portion of deferred tax assets management concluded will not be utilized 
the company had a us net deferred tax asset position of million and million at december  and  respectively  which comprises temporary differences and various credit carryforwards 
management has reviewed its us deferred tax assets and has concluded that it is not more likely than not that the company will realize certain net deferred tax assets 
the negative evidence of a cumulative three year us operating loss and a finite carryforward period for the company s us foreign tax credits was sufficiently significant to outweigh all identified positive evidence 
accordingly  the company maintained valuation allowances of million and million as of december  and  respectively  with respect to net us deferred tax assets 
the company had net non us deferred tax asset positions before valuation allowance of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
at those dates  management determined that based upon the available evidence  a valuation allowance was required against non us deferred tax assets in certain tax jurisdictions 
accordingly  the company maintained valuation allowances of million and million as of december  and  respectively  with respect to certain non us deferred tax assets 
for other non us jurisdictions  principally japan  management believes that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized as management expects sufficient future earnings in those jurisdictions 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and operating results 
warranty claims accrual the company records a liability for estimated warranty claims 
the amount of the accrual is based on historical claims data by product group and other factors 
estimated claims could be materially different from actual results for a variety of reasons  including a change in product failure rates and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure  manufacturing changes that could impact product quality  or as yet unrecognized defects in products sold 
at december  and  the company s accrual for estimated future warranty costs was million and million  respectively 
share based compensation u 
s generally accepted accounting principles require the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
the company must estimate the value of employee stock option and restricted stock awards on the date of grant 
the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards is valued based on the company s stock price on the date of grant 
the fair value of stock option awards is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model affected by the company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards  risk free interest rate and dividend yield assumptions  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors and forfeitures 
because share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it is recorded net of estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience and current expectations 
if the above factors change  and the company uses different assumptions in future periods  the share based compensation expense recorded may differ significantly from what was recorded in the current period 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table sets forth the results of operations and the relationship between various components of operations  stated as a percent of net sales  for the years ended december  and the company s historical financial data was derived from its consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report

from a low point of million in the first quarter of  sales of the company s products and services rose steadily to million  million and million in the second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
quarterly sales increased to million  million  million and million in sales growth in reflected continued positive trends in the company s core semiconductor markets 
each of the company s three operating segments experienced significant net sales increases 
see the segment analysis included below in this section for additional detail 
the sales included favorable foreign currency translation effects of million compared to this impact related to the year over year strengthening of most international currencies versus the us dollar  most notably the japanese yen  korean won  singaporean dollar and taiwanese dollar  offset partly by a weaker euro 
the sales increase for also reflected the full year inclusion of incremental sales of million of the company s pureline subsidiary  which was acquired in july excluding these factors  net sales rose approximately in when compared to total sales to north america were  asia pacific  europe and japan in on a geographic basis  total sales north america were  asia pacific  europe and japan in when comparing to  all regions experienced significant year over year sales increases 
net sales to customers in north america  asia  europe  and japan increased    and  respectively 
a portion of the asia and japan increases related to favorable foreign currency translation effects 
net of favorable currency translation effects  sales increased and for asia and japan  respectively 
sales in europe rose approximately compared to a year ago  excluding the unfavorable foreign currency translation effect 
demand drivers for the company s business primarily consist of semiconductor fab utilization and production unit driven as well as capital spending for new or upgraded semiconductor fabrication facilities capital driven the company analyzes sales of its products by these two key drivers 
both unit driven and capital driven sales in increased as compared with sales of unit driven products represented of sales and sales of capital driven products represented of total sales in this compares to a unit driven to capital driven ratio of for the year over year shift in relative demand reflects the increase in capital spending by semiconductor customers after the very low spending for capacity related products in the first half of sales of unit driven products increased in unit driven products generally have average lives of less than months or need to be replaced based on usage levels 
these products include liquid filters used in the photolithography  cmp and wet etch and clean processes  and wafer shippers used to ship raw wafers  particularly at wafer sizes of mm and below 
sales of shippers and liquid filtration products rose by and  respectively 
year over year sales of capital driven products increased in capital driven products include wafer process carriers  gas microcontamination control systems used in the deployment of advanced photolithography processes  fluid handling systems  including dispense pumps used in the photolithography process  and integrated liquid flow controllers used in various processes around the fab 
sales of components and systems increased led by higher sales of fitting valves and flow controllers 
sales of wafer transport products such as mm and mm foups increased by 
sales of gas microcontamination products  which consist of gas filters and purification systems  rose by 
the company believes the sales increases noted above are primarily volume driven 
based on the information available  the company believes it improved or maintained market share for its products and that the effect of selling price erosion was nominal 
additionally  given that no single customer accounts for more than of the company s annual revenue  the increase in sales has not been driven by any one particular customer or group of customers  but rather by the recovery in the semiconductor and other high technology sectors as a whole 
gross profit gross profit for increased by million  to million  an increase of from million for the gross margin rate for was versus for the company s considerably higher gross profit and improved gross margin compared to a year earlier mainly reflect the significant year over year sales increase and the associated increased levels of factory utilization 
sales increases  along with a slight improvement in sales mix  accounted for approximately of the gross profit improvement in the remaining gross profit improvements reflected improved factory utilization approximately million  the reduction in cost of sales period expense recorded in connection with manufacturing production falling below normal capacity described in further detail below and the absence of million in incremental charges recorded in associated with the fair market value write up of inventory acquired in business combinations 
the inventory mark ups were recorded in connection with the poco graphite  inc poco and pureline co  ltd 
pureline business combinations and were charged to cost of sales over inventory turns of the acquired inventory 
the net reduction in charges associated with the amortization of the fair market value mark ups had a favorable impact on the company s consolidated gross margin rate 
as noted in the preceding paragraph  the company s gross profit and gross margin rate benefitted from the reduction in cost of sales period expense recorded in connection with manufacturing production falling below normal capacity 
during  the company experienced very low levels of factory utilization  particularly during the first half of the year 
accordingly  the company included in cost of sales period expense of million in in connection with its below capacity production levels 
the comparable amount was million 
the net reduction in charges associated with below capacity production levels had a favorable impact on the company s consolidated gross margin rate in selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for increased million  or  to million from million in sg a expenses  as a percent of net sales  decreased to from a year earlier  as the increase in net sales exceeded the growth in sg a expenses 
the increase in sg a expenses was due to higher employee costs million  mainly reflecting the reversal of salary reductions and the absence of unpaid employee furloughs put in place in  as well as higher sales commission expense and the accrual of incentive compensation in in addition  the increase in sg a costs reflects unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of million 
engineering  research and development expenses engineering  research and development er d expenses increased by million  or  to million in compared to million in er d expenses as a percent of net sales were compared to a year ago  reflecting the significant increase in net sales  offset in part by the increase in er d expenditure levels 
the increase in er d expense mainly reflects higher employee costs million  reflecting the reversal of salary reductions and the accrual of incentive compensation in  as well as increases in overall er d expense levels related to the support of current product lines and the development of new products and manufacturing technologies 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets was million in compared to million for the decline reflects the absence of amortization expense for certain acquired developed technology and tradename assets that became fully amortized in either or restructuring charges the company incurred no restructuring charges in restructuring charges of million were recorded in associated with employee termination and other costs related to the business restructuring actions taken in response to the downturn in the semiconductor industry as well as the global business restructuring of the company s sales and marketing function  manufacturing operations  and realignment of the global supply chain and other ancillary operational functions initiated late in see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for additional detail 
interest expense  net net interest expense was million in compared to net interest expense of million in the decrease was due mainly to a significant decrease in the company s average outstanding debt compared to a year ago 
interest expense for included a charge of million for the accelerated write off of previously capitalized debt issuance costs associated with the reduction in the company s revolving credit commitment from million to million as per the may  amendment to the company s revolving credit agreement 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for additional detail 
other expense  net other expense was million in compared to million in in  other expense reflects foreign currency transaction losses of million  primarily related to the remeasurement of yen denominated assets and liabilities held by the company s us entity  offset in part by gains of million on the sale of the company s interest in two equity investments 
in  other expense included foreign currency transaction losses of million  primarily related to the remeasurement of yen denominated assets and liabilities held by the company s us entity  and an impairment loss on an equity investment of million in the fourth quarter of income tax expense benefit the company recorded income tax expense of million in compared to an income tax benefit of million in the company s year to date effective tax rate was in  compared to in in  the company s effective tax rate was lower than us statutory rates mainly due to the million decrease in the company s us deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
management concluded the company will realize certain deferred tax assets related to current taxes payable and has thus released the allowance for a portion of its us deferred tax assets 
the effective tax rate also benefitted from the company s tax holiday in malaysia whereby  as a result of employment commitments  research and development expenditures and capital investments made by the company  income from certain manufacturing activities in malaysia is exempt from income taxes 
the effective tax rate is also affected by lower tax rates in certain of the company s taxable jurisdictions 
in  the company s tax benefit was lower than expected under us statutory rates  mainly due to the million increase in the company s us deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
management concluded that it was not more likely than not that the company would realize certain deferred tax assets associated with domestic operating losses  and thus provided an allowance for the portion of deferred tax assets that management concluded will not be utilized 
the company also reduced its foreign valuation allowance by million 
equity in net loss of affiliates the company recorded equity in the net loss of affiliates of million in compared to equity in the net loss of affiliates of million in results in included an impairment loss of million as the company determined that one of its investments accounted under the equity method was partially impaired 
net income loss attributable to entegris  inc net income attributable to the company was million  or per diluted share  in compared to a net loss attributable to the company of million  or per share  in the significant improvement mainly reflects the company s significantly higher net sales and corresponding increase in gross profit  partly offset by higher sg a and er d expenses  as described in greater detail above 
segment analysis the company reports its financial performance based on three reporting segments 
the following is a discussion of the results of operations of these three business segments

the company believes the revenue downturn was primarily volume driven 
based on the information available  the company believes it maintained market share for its products and that the effect of selling price erosion was nominal 
the sales decline was mitigated by the full year inclusion of sales of poco graphite  inc poco  which was acquired in august excluding that factor  sales fell in when compared to the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency rates was negligible 
the sales decline included an unfavorable foreign currency translation effect of million related to the year over year weakening of most international currencies  most notably the korean won  taiwanese dollar and the euro  versus the us dollar  which was essentially offset by the relative strength of the japanese yen against the us dollar

gross profit gross profit for decreased by million  to million  a decrease of from million for the gross margin rate for was versus for the significant year over year sales decrease accounted for approximately of the gross profit decline for the company experienced lower factory utilization due to the sales decrease  particularly during the first half of the year 
this resulted in manufacturing production falling below normal capacity 
accordingly  the company included in cost of sales period expense of million in the year ended december  in connection with its below capacity production levels  accounting for a decrease in the company s gross margin rate 
in addition  the company s gross profit in was also affected by unfavorable product mix  with a greater portion of sales related to lower margin products  as well as increased overhead rates associated with reduced production levels

non gaap information the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the company also provides certain non gaap financial measures as a complement to financial measures provided in accordance with gaap in order to better assess and reflect trends affecting the company s business and results of operations 
regulation g  conditions for use of non gaap financial measures  and other regulations under the securities exchange act of  as amended  define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non gaap financial information 
the company provides non gaap financial measures of adjusted ebitda and adjusted operating income loss together with related measures thereof  and non gaap earnings per share eps 
adjusted ebitda  a non gaap term  is defined by the company as net income attributable to entegris  inc before net income attributable to noncontrolling interest  equity in net earnings loss of affiliates  income tax expense benefit other expense  net  interest expense  net  restructuring costs  charge for fair value mark up of acquired inventory sold  amortization of intangible assets and depreciation 
adjusted operating income loss  another non gaap term  is defined by the company as its adjusted ebitda plus depreciation 
the company also utilizes non gaap measures whereby adjusted ebitda and adjusted operating income loss are each divided by the company s net sales to derive adjusted ebitda margin and adjusted operating margin  respectively 
non gaap eps  a non gaap term  is defined by the company as net income attributable to entegris  inc before charge for fair value mark up of acquired inventory sold  amortization of intangible assets  accelerated write off of debt issuance costs  gain on sale of equity investments and tax effect of the other adjustments to net income loss attributable to entegris  inc the company provides supplemental non gaap financial measures to better understand and manage its business and believes these measures provide investors and analysts additional and meaningful information for the assessment of the company s ongoing results 
management also uses these non gaap measures to assist in the evaluation of the performance of its business segments and to make operating decisions 
management believes the company s non gaap measures help indicate the company s baseline performance before certain gains  losses or other charges that may not be indicative of the company s business or future outlook and offer a useful view of business performance in that the measures provide a more consistent means of comparing performance 
the company believes the non gaap measures aid investors overall understanding of the company s results by providing a higher degree of transparency for such items and providing a level of disclosure that will help investors understand how management plans  measures and evaluates the company s business performance 
management believes that the inclusion of non gaap measures provides consistency in its financial reporting and facilitates investors understanding of the company s historic operating trends by providing an additional basis for comparisons to prior periods 
management uses adjusted ebitda and adjusted operating income loss to assist it in evaluations of the company s operating performance by excluding items that management does not consider as relevant in the results of its ongoing operations 
internally  these non gaap measures are used by management for planning and forecasting purposes  including the preparation of internal budgets  for allocating resources to enhance financial performance  for evaluating the effectiveness of operational strategies  and for evaluating the company s capacity to fund capital expenditures  secure financing and expand its business 
in addition  and as a consequence of the importance of these non gaap financial measures in managing its business  the company s board of directors uses non gaap financial measures in the evaluation process to determine management compensation 
the company believes that certain analysts and investors use adjusted ebitda  adjusted operating income loss and non gaap eps as supplemental measures to evaluate the overall operating performance of firms in the company s industry 
additionally  lenders or potential lenders use adjusted ebitda measures to evaluate the company s creditworthiness 
the presentation of non gaap financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation  as a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures or information provided in accordance with gaap 
management strongly encourages investors to review the company s consolidated financial statements in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure 
management notes that the use of non gaap measures has limitations first  non gaap financial measures are not standardized 
accordingly  the methodology used to produce the company s non gaap financial measures is not computed under gaap and may differ notably from the methodology used by other companies 
for example  the company s non gaap measure of adjusted ebitda may not be directly comparable to ebitda or an adjusted ebitda measure reported by other companies 
second  the company s non gaap financial measures exclude items such as amortization of intangibles and depreciation that are recurring 
amortization of intangibles and depreciation have been  and will continue to be for the foreseeable future  a significant recurring expense with an impact upon the company s results of operations  notwithstanding the lack of immediate impact upon cash flows 
third  there is no assurance the company will not have future restructuring activities  gains or losses on sale of equity investments  charges for fair value mark up of acquired inventory sold  accelerated write offs of debt issuance costs or similar items and  therefore  may need to record additional charges or credits associated with such items  including the tax effects thereon 
the exclusion of these items from the company s non gaap measures should not be construed as an implication that these costs are unusual  infrequent or non recurring 
management considers these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from these non gaap financial measures and evaluating these non gaap financial measures together with their most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap 
the calculations of adjusted ebitda  adjusted operating income loss  and non gaap eps  and reconciliations between these financial measures and their most directly comparable gaap equivalents are presented below in the accompanying tables

at december   the company had no outstanding forward contracts 
impact of inflation the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared on a historical cost basis  which does not completely account for the effects of inflation 
material and labor expenses are the company s primary costs 
the cost of its materials  including polymers and stainless steel  was slightly higher in compared to entegris expects the cost of these materials to increase in labor costs  including taxes and fringe benefits were higher in due to reversal of salary reductions and the absence of employee furloughs in place in as the company took actions to align spending with lower sales volumes amidst the semiconductor industry s downturn 
slightly higher total labor costs can be reasonably anticipated for the company s products are sold under contractual arrangements with its large customers and at current market prices to other customers 
consequently  the company can adjust its selling prices  to the extent allowed by competition and contractual arrangements  to reflect cost increases caused by inflation 
however  many of these cost increases may not be recoverable
