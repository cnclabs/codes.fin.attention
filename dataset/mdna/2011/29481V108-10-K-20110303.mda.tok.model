item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were founded in to provide cardiac safety solutions to evaluate the safety of new drugs 
we are a global technology driven provider of services and customizable medical devices to biopharmaceutical and healthcare organizations 
we are the market leader for centralized cardiac safety and respiratory efficacy services in drug development and also collect  analyze and distribute electronic patient reported outcomes epro tm in multiple modalities across all phases of clinical research 
we provide centralized cardiac safety testing which is a critical component of diagnostic testing in clinical trials 
our cardiac safety solutions include the collection  interpretation and distribution of electrocardiographic ecg data and images and are performed during clinical trials in all phases of the clinical research process 
the ecg provides an electronic map of the heart s rhythm and structure  and is performed in most clinical trials 
our cardiac safety services permit assessments of the safety of therapies by documenting the occurrence of cardiac electrical change 
specific trials  such as a thorough qtc study  focus on the cardiac safety profile of a compound 
thorough qtc studies are comprehensive studies that typically are of large volume and short duration and are generally required by the united states food and drug administration fda under guidance issued in by the international committee on harmonization ich e 
we offer centralized respiratory solutions  which are utilized by biopharmaceutical and healthcare organizations and cros that are developing new compounds for the treatment of asthma  cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd to assess the efficacy of a drug or to evaluate compounds that have an effect on pulmonary functions 
we also offer site support  which includes the rental and sale of equipment to support cardiac and respiratory services along with related supplies and logistics management 
we also offer epro solutions along with proprietary clinical assessments 
on may   we acquired research services germany gmbh research services or rs  a leading provider of respiratory diagnostics services and a manufacturer of equipment that also offers cardiac safety and epro services 
rs was formed as a result of a demerger of carefusion germany gmbh under german law  which effectively divided carefusion germany gmbh into rs and another entity 
rs is comprised of the research services division of carefusion germany gmbh and certain research operations of carefusion corporation carefusion 
we paid million for rs 
the acquisition and related transaction costs were financed from our existing cash and a portion of the million drawn from our million revolving credit facility 
the credit facility was established on may  we have included rs s operating results in our consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition 
our services revenues consist primarily of our services offered under our cardiac safety  respiratory and  to a lesser extent  our epro solutions that we provide on a fee for services basis 
our services revenue are recognized as the services are performed 
we also provide cardiac safety and respiratory consulting services on a time and materials basis and recognize revenues as we perform the services 
our site support revenue  consisting of equipment rentals and sales along with related supplies and logistics management  are recognized at the time of sale or over the rental period 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables where the fair value of each element is known  the revenue is allocated to each component based on the relative fair value of each element 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables where the fair value of one or more delivered elements is not known  revenue is allocated to each component of the arrangement using the residual method provided that the fair value of all undelivered elements is known 
fair values for undelivered elements are based primarily upon stated renewal rates for future products or services 
we have recorded reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred as revenue in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
unbilled revenue is revenue that is recognized but is currently not billable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms 
in general  such amounts become billable in accordance with predetermined payment schedules  but recognized as revenue as services are performed 
amounts included in unbilled revenue are expected to be collected within one year and are included within current assets 

table of contents our former electronic data capture edc operations are included in edc licenses and services revenue and included license revenue  technology consulting and training services and software maintenance services 
we recognized up front license fee revenues under the residual method when a formal agreement existed  delivery of the software and related documentation occurred  collectability was probable and the license fee was fixed or determinable 
we recognized monthly and annual term license fee revenues over the term of the arrangement 
hosting service fees were recognized evenly over the term of the service 
we recognized revenues from software maintenance contracts on a straight line basis over the term of the maintenance contract  which was typically twelve months 
we provided consulting and training services on a time and materials basis and recognized revenues as we performed the services 
cost of services includes the cost of cardiac safety  respiratory and epro services 
cost of services consists primarily of wages  depreciation  amortization of intangible assets  fees paid to consultants  royalties on licensed technology and other direct operating costs 
cost of site support consists primarily of wages  equipment rent and depreciation  amortization of intangible assets  supplies  cost of equipment sold  shipping expenses and other direct operating costs 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of wages and incentive compensation paid to sales personnel  travel expenses  advertising and promotional expenditures and royalties paid to our business development partners 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and direct costs for our finance  administrative  corporate information technology and executive management functions  in addition to professional service fees and corporate insurance 
research and development expenses consist primarily of wages paid to our product development staff  costs paid to outside consultants and other direct costs associated with the development of our technology 
costs of our former edc operations included primarily wages  fees paid to outside consultants and other direct operating costs related to our software licensing  consulting and customer support functions 
we conduct our operations through offices in the united states us and europe the united kingdom and germany 
our international net revenues represented approximately  and of total net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the majority of our revenues are allocated among our geographic segments based upon the profit split transfer pricing methodology which equalizes gross margins for each legal entity  based upon its respective direct revenue or direct costs  as determined by the relevant revenue source 
through september   we calculated our transfer pricing for cardiac safety services using a profit split methodology based on cost 
subsequent to september   the profit split transfer pricing methodology was modified for cardiac safety services to allocate costs based on revenue instead of allocating revenue based on costs 
this has resulted in an increase in revenue attributed to the uk beginning in the fourth quarter of results of operations executive overview net revenues were million for  an increase of million or from million in due to the acquisition of rs which contributed million of revenue from the acquisition date 
revenue from our legacy business  which excludes the results of rs  reflected continued slower conversion of backlog to revenue as larger customers reacted to the recent economic recession by reducing costs through delay of development spending and cancellation of trials for drugs and our small to mid sized customers continued to be impacted by the tight credit conditions from the recession 
we also continued to see low demand for thorough qtc studies from our customers as these studies are performed largely for small to mid sized customers and it was this sector of the economy that was most severely impacted by the very tight credit conditions caused by the recession 
our legacy business did experience revenue of million in the fourth quarter of which reflected its highest level in the past eight quarters 
new bookings were million for the year ended december  and backlog was million as of december  gross margin percentage was in compared to in gross margin percentage was impacted by lower transaction volume in our legacy business which declined in compared to as much of our cost structure is fixed in nature 
in addition  the rs operations have historically generated a lower margin than our legacy ert business due to their higher proportion of lower margin site related revenue  higher services costs due to the more labor intensive delivery and the overall impact of integration expenses 
gross margin 
table of contents was also negatively impacted by million of amortization of acquired intangible assets directly related to the rs acquisition 
operating income for was million or of total net revenues compared to million or of total net revenues in total expenses were million in  an increase of million  from million in total expenses primarily increased due to the addition of the rs business 
total expenses also include the million of amortization of acquired intangible assets plus million of acquisition and other related costs  which included a million payment to our chief executive officer upon his retirement in our effective income tax rate for was compared to in  with the reduction due to a greater proportion of income generated from lower tax rate countries  primarily from germany  and from internal structural changes which had the benefit of lowering our us income tax rate 
net income for was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  in during the latter half of  we recognized the need to modify the rs operations work flow processes and infrastructure to expand capacity to support customer requirements for active and new studies 
this did impact our ability to contract for new business with certain clients who required faster commencement of studies than our standard delivery time would allow and still maintain our desired level of quality 
we added new staff in germany during the fourth quarter and into our first quarter of and continue the development of our new integrated data handling platform  expert the expert platform will further expand the rs capacity by improving the efficiency and reducing the complexity of our processes 
in  we will be making investments to complete the integration of the rs business and to strengthen our infrastructure and pilot expansion projects of our products and services into adjacent markets 
while these investments will impact our earnings  we continue to believe our strategy will better position us for improved growth and profitability in and beyond

table of contents edc on june   we completed the sale of certain assets relating to our edc operations 
during the year ended december   we recorded a gain on the sale of these assets of million within general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
revenues services revenues for the year ended december  included million from the operations of rs 
apart from the impact of rs  services revenues were essentially flat from to  with a million reduction in transaction revenue related to lower volume of transactions performed in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  being offset by a number of revenue increases totaling million  primarily from our epro operations 
site support revenues for the year ended december  included million from the operations of rs 
apart from the impact of rs  the increase in site support revenue was primarily due to million associated with an increase in the number of units rented in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   million increase in equipment sales and million increase in supplies revenue 
partially offsetting these increases was a million decrease in revenue attributable to decreases in average rental per unit and a decrease of million of other revenue items 
costs of revenues the cost of services revenues for the year ended december  included million from the operations of rs 
apart from the impact of rs  the decrease in the cost of services was primarily due to a million reduction in labor costs  largely as a result of a change in the classification of the costs associated with the customer support center to report these as additional costs of site support in to better align costs with related revenue 
we have also realized cost savings as a result of efficiency initiatives implemented in the latter part of additionally  depreciation expense decreased by million as computer equipment purchased for the development and implementation of the expert technology platform has become fully depreciated 
partially offsetting these decreases were increases in variable incentive compensation expenses of million  for consulting and million for telephone and connectivity 
the increase in cost of services revenues as a percentage of service revenues was due to the rs operations 
the cost of site support revenues for the year ended december  included million from the operations of rs 
apart from the impact of rs  the decrease in the cost of site support was primarily due to a million decrease in depreciation expense as older  more expensive ecg equipment has become fully depreciated and a million decrease in freight 
partially offsetting these decreases was a million increase in labor costs in  largely associated with the customer support center as discussed above 
the increase in cost of site support revenues as a percentage of site support revenues was due to the rs operations 
operating expenses selling and marketing expenses for the year ended december  included million from the operations of rs 
apart from the impact of rs  the increase in selling and marketing expenses was due primarily to million in higher labor costs due to higher commissionable revenue  million in higher variable incentive compensation expenses and million each in higher marketing costs and royalties 
these increases were partially offset by million lower consulting costs 
the decrease in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total net revenues reflects the fact that the costs do not necessarily change in direct relation with changes in revenue 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  included million from the operations of rs 
apart from the impact of rs  the increase in general and administrative expenses  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total net revenues  was due primarily to million of professional fees incurred related to transaction costs associated with our acquisition of rs 
labor costs increased million which included a payment to our chief executive officer upon his retirement in we added million to the reserve for 
table of contents losses on the lease of our former reno  nevada facility due to continued poor prospects for subleasing that facility 
we recognized a million gain on sale of our former edc business in the second quarter of which decreased our expenses in additionally  software costs increased million and consultant costs increased million as a result of an information technology modernization and virtualization project started in late and continuing in there was a million increase in variable incentive compensation expenses 
travel costs increased million as a result of continuing integration costs associated with the rs acquisition 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  included million from the operations of rs 
apart from the impact of rs  the decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to a million reduction in labor costs as a result of the sale of our former edc operations in june and a million increase in the capitalization of salaries and consultant fees associated with internal use software development projects during these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in variable incentive compensation expenses 
the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of total net revenues reflects the fact that the costs do not necessarily change in direct relation with changes in revenue 
foreign exchange losses increased primarily due to the movement in the exchange rate between the euro  british pound sterling and us dollar that impacts our operations in germany and in the uk 
other income expense  net  changed as we incurred interest expense on advances under our line of credit in that we used to purchase rs and to fund related acquisition expenses and working capital needs  while included a small amount of interest income on our cash balance  a substantial portion of which we used to purchase rs 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  through september   we calculated our transfer pricing for cardiac safety services using a profit split methodology based on cost 
subsequent to september   the profit split transfer pricing methodology was modified for cardiac safety services to allocate costs based on revenue instead of allocating revenue based on costs 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  included the impact of the rs acquisition  which operates primarily in germany which has a lower tax rate than our historic effective tax rate 
however  acquisition costs are not deductible for tax purposes which increased the effective tax rate for the year ended december  by approximately nine percentage points 
additionally  as of july   we reorganized our operations in the united states to align our corporate structure along departmental business lines which has reduced our effective tax rate 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  also includes the impact of uk research and development credits for and not previously claimed and a reserve for a uk tax audit

table of contents revenues the decrease in services revenues was primarily due to a million reduction related to a decrease in transactions performed in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due largely to the decline in thorough qtc studies and  to a lesser extent  a decline in routine studies and the decline in revenue from acquired backlog of ccss 
there was also a decrease in average revenue per transaction that was largely due to a heavier weighting of semi automatic studies which carry lower transaction prices and a decrease in average pricing due to the impact of newly negotiated longer term enterprise agreements with large customers  the total impact of which resulted in a decrease in revenue of approximately million 
project management fees decreased million  consistent with the decreased cardiac safety activity 
the balance of the decrease is due to a million decrease in cardiac safety consulting revenue and a number of smaller decreases totaling million 
beginning in january  we entered into an arrangement with a consulting company owned by our chairman  dr 
morganroth  relating to dr 
morganroth s initiation of a company consulting practice through the transition of his historic consulting services to us 
in return  dr 
morganroth s professional corporation receives a percentage fee of of the net revenues we recognize for dr 
morganroth s services to our customers 
we recorded revenues in connection with services billed to customers under this consulting arrangement of approximately million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
we incurred percentage fees under this consulting arrangement of approximately million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
total amounts payable incurred under this consulting arrangement  including consulting fees and the percentage fees  approximated million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively  and are included in cost of services 
site support revenues decreased primarily due to a million decrease in equipment sales as more customers chose to rent cardiac safety equipment  a million decline in revenue from acquired backlog of ccss and a million reduction in freight revenue due to decreased shipping activity consistent with the decreased cardiac safety activity 
the balance of the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in rental revenue from cardiac safety equipment due to a lower average price per unit  partially offset by an increase in units rented and an increase in supplies revenue 
the lower average price per unit was a result of planned actions that we have recently taken to improve our competitiveness with regard to this component of our revenue 
costs of revenues the decrease in the cost of services was primarily due to million of costs recognized in the year ended december  associated with the ccss operations as compared to million of such costs in the year ended december   primarily consisting of depreciation and amortization 
we completed the integration of the ccss acquisition in the third quarter of with the complete transfer of all operating activities from the ccss reno facility into our operations in philadelphia and peterborough 
additionally  variable incentive compensation expense decreased million due to our reduced operating results  telephone and connectivity expenses decreased million due to lower rates in and cardiac safety consulting costs decreased million 
partially offsetting the decrease were increases in several areas including increased depreciation of due to systems placed in service in the balance of the decrease is due to a number of smaller decreases totaling million 
the increase in the cost of services as a percentage of service revenues reflects the fact that  in the shorter term  some of the costs do not necessarily change in direct relation with changes in revenue 
the decrease in the cost of site support  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of site support revenues  was primarily due to a million decrease in depreciation expense as older  more expensive ecg equipment has become fully depreciated 
additionally there was a million decrease in freight  a million decrease in the cost of equipment sold  million of costs associated with the reno operations of ccss in for which there was no corresponding cost in and million decrease in other costs 
operating expenses the decrease in selling and marketing expenses was due primarily to a million decrease in incentive compensation consistent with our reduced operating results 
partially offsetting this decrease was a increase in consulting and marketing costs due to corporate rebranding and other planned initiatives

non income taxes decreased million due to the decrease in revenue 
partially offsetting these decreases were an additional million reserve related to the lease of our reno facility  severance of million in the second quarter of related to the relocation of our customer care team from our new jersey location to our philadelphia location and an approximately million increase in stock option compensation expense 
the gain on sale of certain assets of the edc operations of million was recorded in the second quarter of a number of smaller increases under million each made up the remaining variance including recruitment and travel and entertainment 
the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues reflected the fact that  in the shorter term  the costs do not necessarily change in direct relation with changes in revenue 
the decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to a million reduction in variable incentive compensation expense due to our reduced operating results  a million increase in the capitalization of salaries for internal use software projects and a million decrease in other expenses including labor 
these increases were partially offset by a million increase in expense for third party consultants 
the increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of total net revenues reflected the fact that the costs do not necessarily change in direct relation with changes in revenue 
foreign exchange losses in were caused by dollar denominated receivables in our uk entity that were settled at less favorable exchange rates with the british pound sterling while the gains in resulted from more favorable exchange rates 
in the year ended december  and  other income  net  consisted primarily of interest income which decreased as the result of lower interest rates in as compared to our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the effective tax rate for the year ended december  reflects a change in the calculation of transfer pricing for cardiac safety services 
through  we calculated our transfer pricing for cardiac safety services using a profit split methodology based on cost 
after reviewing the transfer pricing methodology  management decided to modify its application of the profit split methodology for cardiac safety services to allocate costs based on revenue beginning in had we maintained the same calculation in as we used in  the income tax provision would have been increased by approximately million for the year ended december  the effective tax rate for the year ended december  included a special benefit of million related to our determination that a portion of our uk subsidiary s current undistributed net earnings  as well as the future net earnings  will be permanently reinvested  a tax benefit of approximately million related to the reconciliation of the tax provision to the us federal tax return and a million tax benefit related to the reversal of a tax accrual for a previously uncertain tax position 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  primarily invested in money market funds and commercial bank accounts 
of the million  million and million was held by our uk and german subsidiaries  respectively 
although a portion of our uk subsidiary s current undistributed net earnings  as well as any future net earnings of our uk and german subsidiaries  will be permanently reinvested  we believe that this does not have a material impact on our overall liquidity for the year ended december   our operations provided cash of million  an increase of million compared to million during the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of an increase of million increase in accrued expenses in the year ended december  as compared to a million decrease in the year ended december  the increase in the accrued expenses was 
table of contents largely due to an increase in the rs accrued expenses and an increase in the accrual for incentive compensation due to expected improved results against targets as compared to the decrease in was largely the result of the decline in the accrual for variable incentive compensation due to operating results as compared to targets 
other items with a positive impact on operating cash flow in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in included net income before depreciation and amortization  which increased million in as compared to and an increase in accounts payable in which provided million of cash as compared to a million decrease in accounts payable in partially offsetting these increases was an increase in accounts receivable in the year ended december  of million as compared to a decrease of million in the year ended december  the accounts receivable were reduced significantly during the year ended december  as a result of focused collection efforts and a reduction in revenue 
the increase in the accounts receivable in was primarily due to an increase in the rs accounts receivables as rs revenue increased 
for the year ended december   our investing activities used cash of million as compared to million during the year ended december  acquisition payments totaled million in the year ended december   substantially all for rs  as compared to million related to covance cardiac safety services ccss in the year ended december  proceeds from sales of investments net of purchases were million during the year ended december  as compared to purchases of investments of million during the year ended december  during the year ended december  and  we capitalized million and million  respectively  of property and equipment 
included in property and equipment acquisitions was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively  of internal use software 
the balance of the change was primarily due to an increase in purchases of ecg and respiratory equipment commensurate with the additional units rented in the year ended december   which included rs for seven months  as compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   our financing activities provided cash of million as compared to a million use of cash for the year ended december  we obtained proceeds of million from our citizens bank of pennsylvania credit facility which we used to purchase rs on may  and to fund related transaction costs and working capital needs 
we subsequently repaid million 
in the year ended december   we repurchased million of our common stock under our stock buy back program  with no corresponding expenditure in the year ended december  we have a revolving line of credit arrangement with citizens bank of pennsylvania in the aggregate amount of million  with an additional million increase option 
as of december   we have outstanding million under our line of credit and million remains available for us to borrow including the increase option 
the line has a three year term which expires may  and annual interest rates based upon libor plus a margin of to based upon a total leverage ratio and unused commitment fees of to based upon the same total leverage ratio 
from the initial borrowing on may  through december   the annual interest rate ranged from to and the unused commitment fee was 
financial covenants include maximum total senior funded debt to earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda of and minimum debt service coverage ratio of at december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
borrowings under the line of credit are secured by of the capital stock in certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
in december  we entered into a commitment to purchase million of equipment from a manufacturer over a month period beginning in january we expect to purchase this cardiac safety equipment in the normal course of business and thus this commitment does not represent a significant commitment above our expected purchases of ecg equipment during this period 
we have a prior commitment to purchase approximately million of private label cardiac safety equipment from the same manufacturer over a twelve month period ending in the first quarter of as of december   substantially all of the equipment was purchased under the million commitment 

table of contents in march  the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education act of became law 
the provisions of these laws are not expected to have a significant impact to our consolidated financial statements 
we expect that existing cash and cash equivalents  cash flows from operations and amounts available under the million credit facility as discussed above will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs for at least the next year 
in addition  there may be acquisition and other growth opportunities that require additional external financing and we may from time to time seek to obtain additional funds from the public or private issuances of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that any such acquisitions will occur or that such financing will be available or available on terms acceptable to us 
our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to an aggregate of million shares  of which million shares remain to be purchased as of december  the stock buy back authorization allows us  but does not require us  to purchase the authorized shares 
the purchase of the remaining shares authorized could require us to use a significant portion of our cash  cash equivalents and investments and could also require us to seek additional external financing 
during the year ended december   we purchased  shares of our common stock at a cost of million 
no shares were purchased during the year ended december  the following table presents contractual obligations information as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt a purchase obligations b operating leases total a debt amounts include principal maturity and expected interest payments that reflects the year end interest rate 
b purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
we have excluded agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
purchase obligations relate to purchases of rental equipment 
the long term portion of other liabilities is comprised of the present value of estimated lease costs for the reno location 
the gross amount of the payments associated with these liabilities is included in operating leases in the contractual obligations table above 
inflation we believe the effects of inflation and changing prices generally do not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued a new accounting standard regarding revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
as codified in asc formerly emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  this accounting standard sets forth requirements that must be met for an entity to recognize revenue from the sale of a delivered item that is part of a multiple element arrangement when other items have not yet been delivered 
one of those current requirements is that there be objective and reliable evidence of the standalone selling price of the undelivered items  which must be supported by either vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or third party evidence tpe 
this consensus eliminates the requirement that all undelivered elements have vsoe or tpe before an entity can recognize the portion of an overall arrangement fee that is attributable to items that already have been delivered 
in the absence of vsoe or tpe of the standalone selling price for one or more delivered or undelivered elements in 
table of contents a multiple element arrangement  entities will be required to estimate the selling prices of those elements 
the overall arrangement fee will be allocated to each element both delivered and undelivered items based on their relative selling prices  regardless of whether those selling prices are evidenced by vsoe or tpe or are based on the entity s estimated selling price 
application of the residual method of allocating an overall arrangement fee between delivered and undelivered elements will no longer be permitted 
the accounting standard is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we do not believe that this consensus will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued accounting standard update which will require reporting entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements including significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements and information on purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
the fasb also clarified existing fair value measurement disclosure guidance about the level of disaggregation  inputs  and valuation techniques 
except for the detailed level roll forward disclosures  we adopted this standard effective january  the adoption of this aspect of the accounting standard did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the new disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward activity for level fair value measurements are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  we are evaluating the potential impact of these requirements on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
our significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however  the following are our critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition our former electronic data capture edc business is included in edc licenses and services and included license revenue  technology consulting and training services and software maintenance services 
we recognized up front license fee revenues under the residual method when a formal agreement existed  delivery of the software and related documentation occurred  collectability was probable and the license fee was fixed or determinable 
we recognized monthly and annual term license fee revenues over the term of the arrangement 
hosting service fees were recognized evenly over the term of the service 
we recognized revenues from software maintenance contracts on a straight line basis over the term of the maintenance contract  which was typically twelve months 
we provided consulting and training services on a time and materials basis and recognized revenues as we performed the services 
services revenues consist primarily of our services offered under our cardiac safety  respiratory services and  to a lesser extent  epro solutions that we provide on a fee for services basis and are recognized as the services are performed 
we also provide cardiac safety consulting services on a time and materials basis and recognize revenues as we perform the services 
our site support revenue  consisting of equipment rentals and sales along with related supplies and logistics management  are recognized at the time of sale or over the rental period 
at the time of the transaction  management assesses whether the fee associated with our revenue transactions is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
the assessment of whether the fee is fixed or determinable is based upon the payment terms of the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms or upon implementation or customer acceptance  the fee is accounted for as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  revenue is recognized as the fees become due or after implementation or customer acceptance has occurred 

table of contents collectability is assessed based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if it is determined that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  the fee is deferred and revenue is recognized at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
under a typical contract for cardiac safety services  customers pay us a portion of our fee for these services upon contract execution as an upfront deposit  some of which is typically nonrefundable upon contract termination 
revenues are then recognized under cardiac safety service contracts as the services are performed 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables where the fair value of each element is known  the revenue is allocated to each component based on the relative fair value of each element 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables where the fair value of one or more delivered elements is not known  revenue is allocated to each component of the arrangement using the residual method provided that the fair value of all undelivered elements is known 
fair values for undelivered elements are based primarily upon stated renewal rates for future products or services 
we have recorded reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred as revenue in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
unbilled revenue is revenue that is recognized but is currently not billable to the customer pursuant to contractual terms 
in general  such amounts become billable in accordance with predetermined payment schedules  but recognized as revenue as services are performed 
amounts included in unbilled revenue are expected to be collected within one year and are included within current assets 
business combinations on may   we acquired research services germany gmbh research services or rs  a leading provider of respiratory diagnostics services and a manufacturer of equipment that also offers cardiac safety and epro services 
rs was formed as a result of a demerger of carefusion germany gmbh under german law  which effectively divided carefusion germany gmbh into rs and another entity 
rs is comprised of the research services division of carefusion germany gmbh and certain research operations of carefusion corporation carefusion 
we paid million for rs 
the acquisition and related transaction costs were financed from our existing cash and a portion of the million drawn from our million revolving credit facility 
the credit facility was established on may  see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure on the rs acquisition and note to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure regarding the revolving credit facility 
we allocated the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets we acquired and liabilities we assumed based on their estimated fair values 
this valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to long lived and intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer relationships  proprietary technology and discount rates 
our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
for a discussion of how we allocated the purchase price of rs  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill the carrying value of goodwill was million as of december  and million as of december  during the first nine months of  goodwill increased million with million due to the acquisition of rs 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure regarding the rs and ccss acquisitions 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test at least annually 
we perform the impairment test using a two step process annually as of december or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill might be impaired 
the first step is a comparison of the fair value of an internal reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit 
table of contents exceeds its carrying value  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and the second step is unnecessary 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second test is performed to measure the amount of impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the goodwill to a determination of the implied value of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill is greater that the implied value  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference 
the implied value of goodwill is determined as of the test date by performing a purchase price allocation  as if the reporting unit had just been acquired  using currently estimated fair values of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  together with an estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit taken as a whole 
the estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit is based upon information available regarding prices of similar groups of assets  or other valuation techniques including present value techniques based upon estimates of future cash flow 
the results of our annual impairment test performed in indicated that our goodwill and intangible assets were not impaired 
we used many assumptions and estimates that directly impacted the results of our impairment testing  including an estimate of future expected revenues  earnings and cash flows  and discount rates applied to such expected cash flows in order to estimate fair value 
we had the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we chose for testing 
to mitigate undue influence  we set criteria that were reviewed and approved by various levels of management 
the determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting unit 
changes in our strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded amounts of intangible assets 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves management having to estimate our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
management must then assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent that management believes that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
to the extent management establishes or increases a valuation allowance in a period  the consolidated statement of operations will reflect additional income tax expense 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred taxes and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had a valuation allowance of million related to the uncertain realization of certain deferred tax assets 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information 
depreciation and amortization of long lived assets we compute depreciation on our property  plant and equipment on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  which generally range from two to five years 
leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining lease term 
system development costs are amortized on a straight line basis over four or five years or  in the case of enhancements which have no stand alone use  the remaining life of the initial project 
we compute amortization on our intangible assets  other than goodwill  over their estimated useful lives  which generally range from one to ten years 
amortization of backlog from the ccss and rs acquisitions is recognized on an accelerated basis while other intangibles are amortized using the straight line method 
changes in the estimated useful lives or an impairment of long lived assets could have a material effect on our results of operations 
stock based compensation we follow the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation 
we estimate the fair value of options using the black scholes option pricing model with assumptions based primarily on historical data 
the 
table of contents assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model require estimates of the expected term the stock based awards are held until exercised  the estimated volatility of our stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements 
changes in our assumptions may impact the expenses related to our stock options 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  which begin on page f of this form k  for a description of our accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary financial market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk long term debt at december   our long term debt was comprised of million drawn under our million credit facility with citizens bank of pennsylvania 
we do not manage the interest rate risk on our debt through the use of derivative instruments 
our credit facility s interest rates may be reset due to fluctuations in the london interbank offered rate libor 
a hypothetical basis point change in the interest rate of our credit facilities would change our annual pre tax earnings by million based on our current borrowings under the credit facility 
investments we generally place our investments in highly rated securities such as money market funds  municipal securities  bonds of government sponsored agencies  certificates of deposit with fixed rates with maturities of less than one year and ap rated commercial bonds and paper 
we actively manage our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments  but in order to ensure liquidity  will only invest in instruments with high credit quality where a secondary market exists 
we have not held and do not hold any derivatives related to our interest rate exposure 
due to the average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
the impact on interest income of future changes in investment yields will depend largely on the gross amount of our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments 
see liquidity and capital resources as part of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
foreign currency risk we operate on a global basis from locations in the united states us  the united kingdom uk and germany 
all international net revenues and expenses are billed or incurred in either us dollars  british pounds sterling or euros 
as such  we face exposure to adverse movements in the exchange rate of the pound sterling and euro 
as the currency rate changes  translation of the statement of operations of our uk and german subsidiaries from the local currency to us dollars affects year to year comparability of operating results 
with the recent rs acquisition  there has been a significant increase in activity in countries outside the us as a result  while we did not hedge translation risks through december   we have implemented a hedging strategy in our costs in germany are subject to foreign exchange fluctuations as the majority of these costs are paid in euros 
we entered into foreign exchange contracts in january and february to mitigate such foreign exchange fluctuations 
we entered into forward contracts to sell million us dollars and purchase euros at an average price of us dollars to euro 
such contracts have various maturities through march  management estimates that a change in the exchange rate of the pound sterling and euro would have impacted the reported operating income for the year ended december  by approximately million
