table of contents overview we provide digital signage software  hardware and services solutions to customers who use our products and services in certain retail and service markets 
through our proprietary ronincast x software  we provide enterprise  web based and hosted content delivery systems that manage  schedule and deliver digital content over wireless and wired networks 
we also provide custom interactive software solutions  content engineering and creative services to our customers 
while the digital signage system solutions that we provide have application in a wide variety of industries  we focus on three primary markets automotive  food service including qsr  fast casual and managed food services markets  and branded retail 
the industries in which we sell goods and services are not new but their application of digital signage solutions is relatively new within the last five years and these industries have not widely accepted or adopted digital signage 
as a result  we remain an early stage company without an established history of profitability  or substantial or steady revenue 
we believe this characterization applies to our competitors as well  all of which are working to promote broader adoption of digital signage solutions and to develop profitable  substantial and steady sources of revenue 
we believe that the adoption of digital signage technology will increase substantially in years to come both in industries on which we currently focus and in other industries 
we also believe that adoption of digital signage depends not only upon the software and services that we provide but upon the cost of hardware used to process and display content in digital signage systems 
digital media players and flat panel displays constitute a large portion of the expenditure customers make relative to the entire cost of digital signage systems 
costs of these digital media players and flat panel displays have historically decreased and we believe will continue to do so  though we do not manufacture either product and do not substantially affect the overall markets for these products 
if prices continue to decline for this hardware  we believe that adoption of digital signage technology is likely to increase  though we cannot predict a precise rate at which adoption will occur 
management focuses on a wide variety of financial measurements to assess our financial health and prospects but principally upon sales  to measure the adoption of digital signage technology by our customers  cost of sales and gross profit  particularly expressed as gross profit percentage  to determine if sales have been made at levels of profit necessary to cover operating expenses on a long term basis based upon assumptions regarding adoption of digital signage technology  sales of hardware relative to software and services  understanding that hardware typically provides a lower gross profit margin than do software license fees and services  operating expenses so that management can appropriately match those expenses with sales  and current assets  especially cash and cash equivalents used to fund operating losses thus far incurred 
our wholly owned subsidiary  wireless ronin technologies canada  inc rnin canada  an ontario  canada provincial corporation located in windsor  ontario  maintains a vertical specific focus in the automotive industry and houses our content engineering operation 
rnin canada develops digital content and sales support systems to help retailers train their sales staff and educate their customers at the point of sale 
today  the capabilities of this operation are integrated with our historical business to provide content solutions to all of our clients 
our company and our subsidiary sell products and services primarily throughout north america 
our sources of revenue we generate revenues through system sales  license fees and separate service fees  including consulting  content development and implementation services  as well as ongoing customer support and maintenance  including product upgrades 
we currently market and sell our software and service solutions primarily through our direct sales force  but we also utilize strategic partnerships and business alliances 

table of contents our expenses our expenses are primarily comprised of three categories sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative 
sales and marketing expenses include salaries and benefits for our sales associates and commissions paid on sales 
this category also includes amounts spent on the hardware and software we use to prospect new customers  including those expenses incurred in trade shows and product demonstrations 
our research and development expenses represent the salaries and benefits of those individuals who develop and maintain our software products including ronincast and other software applications we design and sell to our customers 
our general and administrative expenses consist of corporate overhead  including administrative salaries  real property lease payments  salaries and benefits for our corporate officers and other expenses such as legal and accounting fees 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
in recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations  we use estimates based on the best information available 
we use estimates for such items as depreciable lives  volatility factors in determining fair value of options and warrants  tax provisions  recognition of revenue under fixed price contracts  provisions for uncollectible receivables and deferred revenue 
we revise the recorded estimates when better information is available  facts change or we can determine actual amounts 
these revisions can affect operating results 
we have identified below the following accounting policies that we consider to be critical 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue primarily from these sources software and software license sales system hardware sales professional service revenue software design and development services implementation services maintenance and hosting support contracts we apply the provisions of accounting standards codification subtopic  revenue recognition software or asc to all transactions involving the sale of software licenses 
in the event of a multiple element arrangement  we evaluate if each element represents a separate unit of accounting  taking into account all factors following the guidelines set forth in fasb asc we recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  which is when product title transfers to the customer  or services have been rendered  iii customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies and significant uncertainties  and iv collection is probable 
we assess collectability based on a number of factors  including the customer s past payment history and its current creditworthiness 
if it is determined that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the revenue and recognizes it at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash payment 
if an acceptance period is required  revenue is recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period 
multiple element arrangements we enter into arrangements with customers that include a combination of software products  system hardware  maintenance and support  or installation and training services 
we allocate the total arrangement fee among the various elements of the arrangement based on the relative fair value of each of the undelivered elements determined by vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
in software arrangements for which we do not have vsoe of fair value for all elements  revenue is deferred until the earlier of when vsoe is determined for the undelivered elements residual method or when all elements for which we do not have vsoe of fair value have been delivered 

table of contents the vsoe for maintenance and support services is based upon the renewal rate for continued service arrangements 
the vsoe of installation and training services is established based upon pricing for the services 
the vsoe of software and licenses is based on the normal pricing and discounting for the product when sold separately 
each element of our multiple element arrangements qualifies for separate accounting 
however  when a sale includes both software and maintenance  we defer revenue under the residual method of accounting 
under this method  the undelivered maintenance and support fees included in the price of software is amortized ratably over the period the services are provided 
we defer maintenance and support fees based upon the customer s renewal rate for these services 
software and software license sales we recognize revenue when a fixed fee order has been received and delivery has occurred to the customer 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies based upon signed agreements received from the customer confirming terms of the transaction 
software is delivered to customers electronically or on a cd rom  and license files are delivered electronically 
system hardware sales we recognize revenue on system hardware sales generally upon shipment of the product or customer acceptance depending upon contractual arrangements with the customer 
shipping charges billed to customers are included in sales and the related shipping costs are included in cost of sales 
professional service revenue included in services and other revenues is revenue derived from implementation  maintenance and support contracts  content development  software development and training 
the majority of consulting and implementation services and accompanying agreements qualify for separate accounting 
implementation and content development services are bid either on a fixed fee basis or on a time and materials basis 
for time and materials contracts  we recognize revenue as services are performed 
for fixed fee contracts  we recognize revenue upon completion of specific contractual milestones or by using the percentage of completion method 
software design and development services revenue from contracts for technology integration consulting services where we design redesign  build and implement new or enhanced systems applications and related processes for clients are recognized on the percentage of completion method in accordance with fasb asc through percentage of completion accounting involves calculating the percentage of services provided during the reporting period compared to the total estimated services to be provided over the duration of the contract 
estimated revenues for applying the percentage of completion method include estimated incentives for which achievement of defined goals is deemed probable 
this method is followed where reasonably dependable estimates of revenues and costs can be made 
we measure our progress for completion based on either the hours worked as a percentage of the total number of hours of the project or by delivery and customer acceptance of specific milestones as outlined per the terms of the agreement with the customer 
estimates of total contract revenue and costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract  and recorded revenue and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses 
such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenue and income and are reflected in the financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified 
if estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur  a loss provision is recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenue that will be generated by the contract and are included in cost of sales and classified in accrued expenses in the balance sheet 
our presentation of revenue recognized on a contract completion basis has been consistently applied for all periods presented 
we classify the revenue and associated cost on the services and other line within the sales and cost of sales sections of the consolidated statement of operations 
in all cases where we apply the contract method of 
table of contents accounting  our only deliverable is professional services  thus  we believe presenting the revenue on a single line is appropriate 
costs and estimated earnings recognized in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts are recorded as unbilled services and are included in accounts receivable on the balance sheet 
billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts are recorded as deferred revenue until revenue recognition criteria are met 
implementation services implementation services revenue is recognized when installation is completed 
maintenance and hosting support contracts maintenance and hosting support consists of software updates and support 
software updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades and maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period 
support includes access to technical support personnel for software and hardware issues 
we also offer a hosting service through our network operations center  or noc  allowing the ability to monitor and support our customers networks days a week  hours a day 
maintenance and hosting support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract  which is typically one to three years 
maintenance and support is renewable by the customer 
rates for maintenance and support  including subsequent renewal rates  are typically established based upon a specified percentage of net license fees as set forth in the arrangement 
our hosting support agreement fees are based on the level of service we provide to our customers  which can range from monitoring the health of our customer s network to supporting a sophisticated web portal 
basic and diluted loss per common share basic and diluted loss per common share for all periods presented is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding 
basic weighted average shares outstanding include only outstanding common shares 
diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average common and potential dilutive common shares outstanding computed in accordance with the treasury stock method 
shares reserved for outstanding stock warrants and options totaling million  million and million for  and  respectively  were excluded from the computation of loss per share as their effect was antidilutive due to our net loss in each of those years 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized in the financial statements for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates 
temporary differences arise from net operating losses  reserves for uncollectible accounts receivables and inventory  differences in depreciation methods  and accrued expenses 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
accounting for stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with fasb asc stock based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of share based awards that are ultimately expected to vest during the period 
the fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value of restricted stock is determined based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of the company s common stock on the date of grant 
compensation expense for all share based payment awards is recognized using the straight line amortization method over the 
table of contents vesting period 
stock based compensation expense of million  million and million was charged to operating expenses during  and  respectively 
no tax benefit has been recorded due to the full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets that we have recorded 
we account for equity instruments issued for services and goods to non employees under fasb asc accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services and fasb asc accounting recognition for certain transactions involving equity instruments granted to other than employees 
generally  the equity instruments issued for services and goods are shares of our common stock  warrants or options to purchase shares of our common stock 
these shares  warrants or options are either fully vested and exercisable at the date of grant or vest over a certain period during which services are provided 
we expense the fair market value of these securities over the period in which the related services are received 
see note in the consolidated financial statements in this form k for further information regarding the impact of fasb asc and the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of stock based compensation 
results of operations our results of operations for the years ended  and were as follows for the years ended december  in thousands sales cost of sales exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below gross profit sales and marketing expenses research and development expenses general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization expense impairment of network equipment held for sale impairment of intangible assets termination of partnership agreement total operating expenses operating loss other income expenses interest expense interest income other total other income net loss 
table of contents our results of operations as a percentage of sales for the years ended  and were as follows for the years ended december  sales cost of sales exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below gross profit sales and marketing expenses research and development expenses general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization expense impairment of network equipment held for sale impairment of intangible assets termination of partnership agreement total operating expenses operating loss other income expenses interest expense interest income other total other income net loss compared to sales our sales increased to million in from million in the year over year increase in revenue was primarily attributable to revenue generated from our marquee customers  including chrysler  aramark  yum kfc and thomson reuters  in addition to new customers 
revenue generated from chrysler totaled million  which was up from million recognized for the prior year 
in addition to assisting chrysler with its ongoing development needs related to the ishowroom initiative during  over half of our revenue from chrysler came from its orders for digital signage systems as part of its branded tower salon to be installed at dealers 
since the branded tower salon is a requirement of chrysler s dealer standards program  which provides incentive dollars back to the dealers  we believe there will be additional orders forthcoming 
however  since dealer participation is not mandatory and we do not have a contract with chrysler requiring it to source all the various components of the solution through us  we are unable to predict or forecast the timing or value of any future orders 
aramark continues to deploy its food concepts  including burger studio and topio s  at many colleges and universities within the united states 
during we installed approximately new locations  which more than doubled the total number of aramark sites managed by our network operations center  or noc  from the beginning of the year 
our sales to aramark during totaled million  representing an increase of when compared to total sales in we continued to penetrate further within yum s qsr brands in by deploying kfc tacobell combination stores 
additionally  we installed a total of new kfc stores  bringing the total number of yum 
table of contents brand stores which we fully host and support through our noc to approximately at the end of we continue to rollout digital menu boards for all new and remodeled stores for kfc 
furthermore  kfc has begun to implement a new highly customized web portal that we finished developing and delivered during in sales to thomson reuters increased to million in when compared to  as we continued to expand the number of infopoint digital signage locations 
as of december   we had a total of locations we were actively supporting through our noc 
additionally in  we received an order to deploy infopoint at sites for a financial services institution with over  locations 
lastly  our recurring hosting and support revenue increased in to million when compared to as a result of an expansion of our customer base from the deployments referenced above 
due to the current economic environment and the lengthy sales cycle associated with deploying large scale digital menu boards  we are not able to predict or forecast our future revenue with any degree of precision at this time 
cost of sales our cost of sales increased to million in from million in the increase in cost of sales was due to the year over year increases in hardware sales and cost associated with delivering our services  including installation  project management  software development and content creation 
on a percentage basis  our overall gross margin improved to in compared to for the prior year 
the primary reason for this increase was the favorable hardware margin we were able to achieve from customers for whom we provided a turn key digital signage solution 
in addition  sales of our ronincast software were up in when compared to  which yielded a gross margin percentage of over for both years 
in addition  our services margin continued to improve as the level of recurring hosting and services revenue increased  which totaled million in compared to million in as a result we experienced an improvement in our services gross margin of percentage points to when comparing to our ability to maintain these levels of gross margin on a percentage basis can be impacted in any given quarter by shifts in our sales mix 
however  we believe over the long term our gross margins on a percentage basis will continue to increase as our recurring revenue grows 
operating expenses sales and marketing expense includes the salaries  employee benefits  commissions  stock compensation expense  travel and overhead costs of our sales and marketing personnel  as well as trade show activities and other marketing costs 
total sales and marketing expenses declined to million in from million in during  our stock compensation expense  which was lower by million compared to  was the primary reason for this decrease in our sales and marketing expenses 
stock compensation expense totaled million in  compared to million in the prior year 
we continue to focus our efforts to maximize the return on investment by attending many of the leading industry digital signage tradeshows  as we believe our presence is necessary to attract and retain new customers 
we traditionally incur higher levels of tradeshow expenditures in the first quarter of our fiscal year compared to the remaining three quarters 
any significant increase in our sales and marketing expenses in relative to would be the result of higher levels of commission expense resulting from an increase in our revenue  as we do not anticipate higher costs associated with tradeshows or marketing initiatives 
research and development expense includes salaries  employee benefits  stock compensation expense  related overhead costs and consulting fees associated with product development  enhancements  upgrades  testing  quality assurance and documentation 
total research and development expenses for increased to million from million in the year over year increase was primarily the result of higher levels of contractor and other engineering consultant expenses as we finished up the first release of our next generation of digital signage software  ronincast x 
since the majority of the development effort of this new software platform was completed during  we incurred additional outside resource costs which primarily accounted for the increase in 
table of contents research and development expenses when compared to the prior year period 
although we currently have no intention of significantly increasing our staff levels in  we may engage outside providers to assist in further enhancements to our ronincast x software which is critical for our success as the requirements for a more sophisticated dynamic digital signage platform continue to evolve 
general and administrative expense includes the salaries  employee benefits  stock compensation expense and related overhead cost of our finance  information technology  human resources and administrative employees  as well as legal and accounting expenses  consulting and contractor fees and bad debt expense 
total general and administrative expenses for decreased to million from million in the decline was primarily the result of a decrease in compensation and benefits  along with reduced contractor costs  partially offset by higher levels of stock compensation expense 
the reduction in compensation and benefits was the direct result of a cost optimization plan that was implemented during  which included an overall reduction in full time employees 
offsetting these reductions was a million increase in stock compensation expense in when compared to as a result of new equity incentives provided to both employees and outside contractors 
we believe our general and administrative costs will not increase significantly in when compared to depreciation and amortization expense 
our depreciation and amortization expense consists primarily of depreciation of computer equipment and office furniture and the amortization of purchased software and leasehold improvements made to our leased facilities 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to the limited number of capital acquisitions during interest expense interest expense increased to  in from  in the increase was primarily the result of  of expense recognized related to the fair value of the warrants issued to silicon valley bank as additional consideration for the million loan and security agreement dated march  the warrant vested on date of grant and we are recognizing the fair value  as determined using the black scholes model  of  over the one year life of the agreement on a straight line basis 
see note to our consolidated financial statements regarding the assumptions used in determining the fair value of this warrant 
compared to sales our sales decreased to million in from million in the year over year decline in revenue was primarily attributable to the lower levels of revenue generated from a slowly recovering automotive industry and limited deployment of digital menu boards for quick serve restaurants 
in  we recognized million of revenue from chrysler and bbdo detroit windsor  which was then an advertising agent for chrysler  and million from yum kfc  compared to million and million for the prior year  respectively 
partially offsetting this decline was an increase in our sales to aramark  which totaled million in compared to million in our hardware sales in of million were lower than our hardware sales of million as a result of certain customers choosing to contract directly with display and media player suppliers 
excluding the resale of a software order we received from dimensional innovations  a non core customer  totaling million  sales of our proprietary ronincast software in were up or million when compared to the prior year 
our decline in services revenue in when compared to was primarily the result of a decline in revenue generated from chrysler llc and bbdo  as mentioned above 
revenue generated outside of the us and canada increased million in when compared to the prior year as a result of an increase in sales to thomson reuters 
cost of sales our cost of sales declined to million in from million in the decrease in cost of sales was due to the year over year decreases in hardware and services revenues of million and million  respectively  and also a reduction in compensation related employees costs due to the workforce reductions taken in 
table of contents the fourth quarter of to better match our infrastructure and expenses with sales levels and current client projects 
operating expenses sales and marketing expenses declined to million in from million in the reduction in sales and marketing expenses related to a decrease in compensation and benefits  along with lower travel related expenses  as a result of the workforce reductions taken in the fourth quarter of in addition  we reduced the level of spending related to tradeshows and other marketing initiatives in compared to the prior year period 
compensation and benefits  including stock compensation expense totaled million for  compared to million for the prior year 
travel expenses were million for  compared to million for the prior year 
tradeshows and other marketing initiatives during totaled million  compared to million during the prior year 
research and development expenses for declined to million from million in the decline was primarily the result of lower compensation and benefits expenses 
general and administrative expenses for decreased to million from million in the decline was primarily the result of a decrease in compensation and benefits  along with reduced contractor costs as a result of the workforce reductions taken in the fourth quarter of  along with other staff reductions taken primarily during the first half of  partially offset by payment of severance benefits 
to streamline our operations and adjust our expenses to reflect the declining revenues  the company made further organizational changes during through a reduction and temporary layoffs of our workforce  both in the us and canada 
total compensation to employees and contractors  including benefits and stock compensation expense totaled million in compared to million for the same period in the prior year 
in addition to the reduction attributable to the workforce reductions taken in  our stock compensation expense decreased million in when compared to the prior year period 
professional fees paid to outside legal and accounting firms also decreased in when compared to our fees paid to outside consultants in totaled million compared to million for the prior year 
the remaining decreases were due to an across the board reduction in almost all expense categories as a result of better aligning our expenses with the lower levels of revenue 
for fiscal year  we recorded million of severance expense in general and administrative expense related to our june separation with our former chief financial officer and our september separation with our former chief executive officer 
for fiscal  we recorded million of severance expense in general and administrative expense related to our march separation with our former executive vice president  content engineering and president  rnin canada and our april separation with our former vice president  controller and interim chief financial officer 
in november and december  we announced workforce reductions of and people  respectively  including both employees and contractors at both our us and canadian operations 
coupled with three other us employee resignations prior to the december reduction in force  these actions resulted in an approximate total headcount reduction during the fourth quarter of these two workforce reductions were intended to align our expense base with the current level of sales and projects  and improve the overall efficiency of the organization 
the combined severance charge from the two workforce reductions totaled approximately million 
of such charge  million related to general and administrative expense and million was related to research and development expense 
depreciation and amortization decreased to million in  from million in the decrease in was primarily the result of recording an impairment charge during the fourth quarter of for the remaining value of our acquisition related intangible assets 
impairment of network equipment held for sale 
in the third quarter of  we re classified a net receivable balance of million to network equipment held for sale when newsight corporation defaulted on its note payable obligation and we took ownership of collateral including in box inventory and an installed digital signage network in meijer stores 
at the time of re classification  meijer  a grocery store chain in the midwest  
table of contents was seeking a new network owner and we intended to sell the network to the new owner 
subsequent to december   meijer abandoned plans to maintain the network 
as a result  we moved approximately million of equipment from the in box collateral base into inventory and recorded an impairment loss in the fourth quarter of on the remaining million of network equipment held for sale 
impairment of intangible assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge for the assets related to the acquisition of mcgill digital solutions 
we reviewed the carrying value of all long lived assets  including intangible assets with finite lives  for impairment in accordance with fasb asc under asc  impairment losses are recorded whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we tested the intangible assets acquired in the acquisition for impairment in the fourth quarter of and determined that the underlying assumptions and economic conditions surrounding the initial valuation of these assets had significantly changed and an impairment loss was recorded for the total million of net book value of these intangible assets 
termination of partnership agreement 
in february  we terminated the strategic partnership agreement with the marshall special assets group  inc marshall which we had entered into in may pursuant to the terms of a mutual termination  release and agreement  we paid marshall million and we agreed to pay a fee in connection with sales of our software and hardware to customers  distributors and resellers for use exclusively in the ultimate operations of or for use in a lottery end users 
under such agreement  we agreed to pay marshall i of the net invoice price for the sale of our software to end users  and ii of the net invoice price for the sale of hardware to end users  in each case collected by us on or before february   with a minimum annual payment of  for three years 
marshall agreed to pay of the costs and expenses incurred by us in relation to any test installations involving sales or prospective sales to end users 
we recorded an expense of  in each of   and owed no minimum payment in interest expense in and  interest expense of approximately  and  respectively  was attributable to capital lease obligations 
the decrease from to in interest expense was the result of lower capital lease balances 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  and working capital of million 
as of december   we did not have any debt 
we plan to use our available cash to fund operations  including the continued development of our products and attraction of new customers through sales and marketing initiatives 
in march  we entered into a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank 
the agreement provides us with a revolving line of credit up to million at an interest rate of prime plus 
our ability to request an advance on this line of credit is based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventory balances 
additionally  we are required to maintain a certain minimum tangible net worth level at either the time of an advancement or while there is an outstanding balance owed to silicon valley bank 
our failure to meet or maintain the minimum tangible net worth requirement will also restrict our ability to borrow additional sums under this agreement 
in january  we entered into an amendment which modified the original expiration date to march and reduced the minimum tangible net worth requirement to million  which must be maintained at either the time of an advance or while there is an outstanding balance owed to silicon valley bank 
we are not required to maintain the financial requirements while there are no outstanding advances 
see subsequent events note to our consolidated financial statements regarding the amendment to the terms and conditions of our loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank 
based on our current expense levels  we anticipate that our cash will be adequate to fund our operations through 
table of contents operating activities we do not currently generate positive cash flow 
our investments in infrastructure have been greater than sales generated to date 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
the cash flow used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and in  net cash used by operating activities was attributable to our net loss and an increase in accounts receivables  inventory  prepaid expenses and other current assets 
the increases in accounts receivable and inventory were the result of our sales being million higher during the fourth quarter of when compared to the same period in the prior year the days sales outstanding were and at december  and  respectively 
cash used in operating activities in was partially offset by an increase in accounts payable  deferred revenue and accrued liabilities 
again  the increases in accounts payable and deferred revenue were attributable to the overall increase in sales during the fourth quarter of when compared to the prior year 
the increase in accrued liabilities included higher commissions payable and other employee related accruals in when compared to the same balances in the prior year 
in  net cash used by operating activities was attributable to our net loss and a reduction in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities accounts 
these amounts were partially offset by cash provided by an overall reduction in our asset accounts and a higher balance of deferred revenue in when compared to the same balances in the prior year 
during  we paid million of severance related costs  which was included in our year end accrued liabilities account at the end of our deferred revenue balance was higher at the end of compared to the same balance in as a result of us being unable to deliver and recognize revenue of million related to a software development order received in december our accounts receivable balance at the end of was lower when compared to the year end balance of as a result of a higher percentage of sales in the fourth quarter of being billed and collected before year end compared to the same period in the prior year 
we also recognized approximately million less revenue in the fourth quarter of when compared to the same period in the prior year 
our inventory balance at the end of was lower when compared to the year end balance of as a result of certain customers deciding to source displays and media players directly from third party suppliers  as well as overall better inventory management 
in  net cash used by operating activities was attributable to our net loss  increases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and decreases in accounts payable and deferred revenue  partially offset by decreases in inventory and corporate taxes receivable and increases in accrued liabilities 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  net cash provided by investing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and in  net cash used in investing activities was attributable to the purchase of property and equipment 
in and  net cash provided by investing activities was primarily the result of net sales of marketable securities of million and million  respectively 
during  we invested substantially all of our cash into a commercial sweep account  as the investment interest rate was higher than interest rates of other high grade short term investments 
the net sales of marketable securities in and were partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of million and million  respectively 
we significantly scaled back our level of capital investments in compared to as a result of the continued cost reduction effort started in the fourth quarter of financing activities we have financed our operations primarily through sales of common stock and the issuance of notes payable to vendors  shareholders and investors 
for the years ended december   and  we generated a net million  million and million from financing activities  respectively 
in november  we sold approximately million shares of our common stock at per share and issued warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at per share pursuant to a registration statement on form s which was declared effective by the sec in september we obtained approximately million in net proceeds as a result of this registered direct offering 
during  we received 
table of contents  from the sale of approximately  shares of common stock to our associates employees through our associate stock purchase plan and we received approximately million from the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants

our restricted cash balance was reduced by million in related to the above referenced letter of credit

we used approximately million in the payment of capital leases during disruptions in the economy and constraints in the credit markets have caused companies to reduce or delay capital investment 
some of our prospective customers may cancel or delay spending on the development or roll out of capital and technology projects with us due to continuing economic uncertainty 
difficult economic conditions have adversely affected certain industries in particular  including the automotive and restaurant industries  in which we have major customers 
we could also experience lower than anticipated order levels from current customers  cancellations of existing but unfulfilled orders  and extended payment or delivery terms 
economic conditions could also materially impact us through insolvency of our suppliers or current customers 
while we have down sized our operations to reflect the decrease in demand  we may not be successful in mirroring current demand 
if customer demand were to decline further  we might be unable to adjust expense levels rapidly enough in response to falling demand or without changing the way in which we operate 
if revenue were to decrease further and we are unable to adequately reduce expense levels  we might incur significant losses that could adversely affect our overall financial performance and the market price of our common stock 
as of december   chrysler accounted for of our total receivables 
in april  chrysler and twenty four of its affiliated subsidiaries filed a consolidated petition for chapter bankruptcy protection with the us federal bankruptcy court in new york city 
while chrysler has emerged from bankruptcy and we continue to receive orders  our revenues were significantly impacted in compared to the prior year see note to our consolidated financial statements regarding segment information and major customers 
in addition  chrysler s former advertising agency  bbdo detroit  the entity responsible for purchasing our products and services on chrysler s behalf  closed its office at the end of january chrysler has subsequently moved its advertising relationship to another firm  which is not currently a customer of ours 
during  we received all purchase orders directly from chrysler  which included orders that traditionally would have been issued through bbdo detroit 
although we believe chrysler s decision to change its advertising agency did not affect any of our current projects  we are unable to provide assurance that future opportunities will not be impacted 
in the case of insolvency by one of our significant customers  an account receivable with respect to that customer might not be collectible  might not be fully collectible  or might be collectible over longer than normal terms  each of which could adversely affect our financial position 
based on our current and anticipated expense levels and our existing capital resources  we anticipate that our cash will be adequate to fund our operations through our future capital requirements  however  will depend on many factors  including our ability to successfully market and sell our products and services  develop new products and services and establish and leverage our strategic partnerships and business alliance relationships 
in order to meet our needs should we not become cash flow positive or should we be unable to sustain positive cash flow  we may be required to raise additional funding through public or private financings  including equity financings 
any additional equity financings may be dilutive to shareholders  and debt financing  if available  would likely involve restrictive covenants 
adequate funds for our operations  whether from financial markets  collaborative or other arrangements  may not be available when needed or on terms attractive to us  especially with credit markets which continue to be risk adverse 
if adequate funds are not available  our plans to expand our 
table of contents business may be adversely affected and we could be required to curtail our activities significantly 
necessary funding may not be available on terms that are favorable to the company  if at all 
off balance sheet arrangements it is not our business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations although we have no material commitments for capital expenditures  we anticipate continued capital expenditures consistent with our anticipated growth in operations  infrastructure and personnel 
unless we experience a significant increase to our revenues  we expect our operating expenses will remain at levels similar to as we continue to control expenses in the current economic environment 
operating and capital leases at december   our principal commitments consisted of long term obligations under operating leases 
we conduct our us operations from a leased facility located at baker road in minnetonka  minnesota

of this amount  million is invested in a daily sweep commercial paper account with silicon valley bank 
we continuously monitor the credit rating of this financial institution and have determined there is a low level of risk of the funds not settling on a daily basis 
additionally  we have no limits or restrictions on our ability to use or access these funds for operating our business 
our external sources of liquidity include a million line of credit we have in place with silicon valley bank 
based on our working capital position at december   we believe we have sufficient working capital to meet our current obligations for at least the next months 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fasb asc  accounting for transfers of financial assets 
fasb asc amends the guidance on transfers of financial assets  including securitization transactions where entities have continued exposure to risks related to transferred financial assets

table of contents in october  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on revenue recognition that will become effective for us beginning january   with earlier adoption permitted 
under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements  tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product will no longer be within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance  and software enabled products will instead be subject to the other relevant revenue recognition guidance 
additionally  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance 
under the new guidance  when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined  a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
the new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
we believe the adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
subsequent events in january  we entered into a first loan modification agreement with silicon valley bank pursuant to which the maturity date of our existing revolving line of credit was extended from march to march the revolving line of credit provides us with credit up to million at an interest rate of prime plus 
the amount of credit available to us at any given time is the lesser of a million  or b the amount available under our borrowing base of our eligible accounts receivable plus of our eligible inventory minus the dollar equivalent amount of all outstanding letters of credit  of each outstanding foreign exchange contract  any amounts used for cash management services  and the outstanding principal balance of any advances 
under the first loan modification agreement  we must maintain a minimum tangible net worth of at least million 
this tangible net worth minimum increases a quarterly by of our net income for each fiscal quarter then ended and b by of the proceeds from future issuances of equity and or the principal amount of subordinated debt 
we must comply with this tangible net worth minimum while there are outstanding credit extensions other than our existing lease letter of credit 
in addition  in connection with our entry into the first loan modification agreement  we entered into an amendment to warrant agreement with silicon valley bank pursuant to which the exercise price of the above referenced warrant was reduced to per share 
the reduced exercise price represents the five day average closing price per share of the our common stock for the period immediately preceding our entry into the first loan modification agreement 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  and accounts receivables 
we maintain our accounts for cash and cash equivalents principally at one major bank 
as of december   our cash was primarily invested in a commercial paper sweep account as the interest rate yield was more favorable than those of united states government securities and money market funds 
we have not experienced any significant losses on our deposits of our cash  cash equivalents  or marketable securities 
we do not believe our operations are currently subject to significant market risks for interest rates or other relevant market price risks of a material nature 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated financial position as well as our consolidated results of operations 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our financial position as the assets and liabilities of our canadian operations are translated into us dollars in preparing our consolidated balance sheet 
these gains or losses are recognized as an adjustment to shareholders equity through accumulated other comprehensive loss
