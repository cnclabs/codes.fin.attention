item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations as well as other sections of this report contain certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of and involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the risks faced by us described in the risk factors section of this report on pages through overview we are a global producer of precision engineered electronic components and modules 
based on our estimates of the total annual revenues in our primary markets and our share of those markets relative to our competitors  we believe we are a leading global producer of electronic components and modules in the primary markets we serve 
we operate our business in three segments our network product group which we refer to as network  our power product group which we refer to as power  and our wireless product group which we refer to as wireless 
network produces a variety of passive components that manage and regulate electronic signals for use in a variety of devices used in local area and wide area networks  such as connectors  filters  filtered connectors  transformers  splitters  micro filters  baluns and chokes 
power primarily manufactures products that adjust and ensure proper current and voltage  limit distortion of voltage  sense and report current and voltage and cause mechanical movement or actuation  which includes power transformers  chokes  current and voltage sensors  ignition coils  automotive coils  military and aerospace products and other power magnetic products 
wireless manufactures products that capture or transmit wireless communication signals  such as antennas  antenna modules and antenna mounting components 
net sales for our three segments for the years ended december   december  and december  were as follows in millions network power wireless net sales general 
we define net sales as gross sales less returns and allowances 
we sometimes refer to net sales as revenue 
historically  our gross margin has been significantly affected by product mix  capacity utilization  divestitures and acquisitions 
the markets served by each of our segments are characterized by relatively short product life cycles  which causes significant product turnover each year and  subsequently  frequent variations in the prices of products sold 
due to the constantly changing quantity of parts each segment offers and the frequent changes in our average selling prices  we cannot isolate the impact of changes in unit volume and unit prices on our net sales or gross margin in any given period 
in addition  our operations are subject to changes in foreign exchange rates  especially the us dollar as compared to the euro and the chinese renminbi  which affect our us dollar reported net sales and results of operations 
we believe our focus on technology and other strategic investments  both internal and external  provides us opportunities for future growth in net sales and operating profit in all our segments 
however  unfavorable economic and market conditions  as well as customer preference  may result in a reduction in the demand for our products  thus negatively impacting our financial performance 
also  we may divest portions of our business  close certain locations or complete other cost reduction programs to permit our management to focus on our core businesses and to improve our overall long term financial performance 

table of contents technology and strategic investments 
our products evolve along with changes in technology  changes in the availability and price of raw materials and changes in design preferences of the end users of our products 
also  regulatory requirements can occasionally impact the design and functionality of our products 
we address these dynamic conditions  as well as our customers demands  by continually investing in the development of each of our segments products and by maintaining a diverse product portfolio which contains both mature and emerging technologies 
we remain committed to technological development through investing in research  development and engineering activities focused on designing next generation products  improving our existing products and improving our manufacturing processes 
if we determine that any of our segments manufacturing processes would benefit from capital investment  we may allocate resources to fund the expansion of property  plant and equipment used in these processes 
for example  in we committed capital to advanced three dimensional antenna equipment which are used to produce the next generation of our wireless products 
also  we have begun committing capital to automate certain manual manufacturing processes for our network and wireless products in order to avoid increasing direct labor costs 
in the future  similar investments in property  plant and equipment or research  development and engineering may be funded through internally generated cash flows or through other external resources 
cost reduction programs 
we continue to simplify our operations to optimally match our capacity to the current and anticipated revenues and unit demand of each of our operating segments 
specific actions to simplify our operations will dictate the future expenses associated with our cost reduction programs 
actions taken over the past several years  such as divestitures  plant closures  plant relocations  asset impairments and reduction in personnel  have resulted in the elimination of a variety of costs 
the majority of these costs  not related to impairment of long lived assets  represent the annual salaries and benefits of terminated employees  including both those related to manufacturing and those that provided selling  general and administrative services 
also  we have experienced depreciation savings from disposed equipment and reductions in rental expense from the termination of lease agreements 
historically  we have also reduced labor and overhead costs as a result of relocating factories to lower cost locations  specifically china 
the savings created by these cost reduction programs impact cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expenses  but the timing of such savings may not be apparent due to other performance factors such as unanticipated changes in demand  changes in unit selling prices  operational challenges and changes in operating strategies 
during the year ended december   we determined that approximately million of our wireless reporting unit s goodwill and identifiable intangible assets were impaired  including million of technology related to our audio products 
also  we recorded an impairment of million to one of our indefinite lived tradenames 
refer to note  goodwill and other intangible assets  to our consolidated financial statements for further details 
additionally  we incurred a charge of million for a number of cost reduction actions 
these charges include severance and related payments of million and fixed asset impairments of million 
the impaired assets were identified in and primarily include machinery and equipment that were unable to be cost efficiently repaired or refitted for other manufacturing purposes 
during the year ended december   we determined that approximately million of our wireless reporting unit s goodwill was impaired 
additionally  we incurred a charge of million for a number of cost reduction actions 
these charges include severance and related payments of million and fixed asset impairments of million 
the impaired assets were identified in and include production lines associated with products that have no expected future demand and two real estate properties which were disposed 
during the year ended december   we determined that million of goodwill and other intangibles were impaired  including million of goodwill and identifiable intangibles of a discontinued operation 
additionally  we incurred a charge of million for a number of cost reduction actions 
these charges include severance and related payments and other associated costs of million resulting from the termination of manufacturing and support personnel at our operations primarily in asia  europe and north america and million of other costs primarily resulting from the transfer of manufacturing operations from europe and north africa to asia 
additionally  we recorded fixed asset impairments of million 
the impaired assets were identified in and primarily include machinery and equipment that were unable to be cost efficiently repaired or refitted for other manufacturing purposes 
divestitures 
we engage in divestitures to streamline our operations  to focus on our core businesses  to reduce our external debt and to strengthen our financial position 
for example  we expect to divest the audio business of our wireless segment for an amount immaterial to our consolidated financial statements during the first quarter of on september   we divested the european and asian businesses of our former electrical contact products segment electrical for net proceeds of approximately million  subject to normal working capital and other financial adjustments 
on january   we completed the sale of electrical s north american business for an amount immaterial to our consolidated financial statements 
in june  we divested our medtech components business for approximately million  which reflects final working capital and other financial adjustments 
in april  we divested our mems business for an amount immaterial to our consolidated financial statements 
we have had no material involvement with any of our divested operations after each respective sale 

table of contents management focus 
our executives focus on a number of metrics to evaluate our consolidated financial condition and operating performance 
for example  we use consolidated revenue growth  gross margin  operating margin and return on research  development and engineering as performance measures 
operating leverage  or incremental operating profit as a percentage of incremental sales  is also reviewed  which reflects the benefit of absorbing fixed overhead and operating expenses 
in evaluating consolidated working capital  liquidity and cash flow  our executives also use performance measures such as days sales outstanding  days payables outstanding  inventory turnover  debt to ebitda leverage  cash conversion efficiency and free cash flow 
we define free cash flow as cash flow from operations less capital spending 
additionally  as the continued success of our business is largely dependent on meeting and exceeding our customers expectations  non financial performance measures relating to product development  product quality and on time delivery assists in monitoring customer satisfaction on an on going basis 
international operations 
at december   we had manufacturing operations in the united states of america and china 
however  nearly all of our products are manufactured in china and sold to customers in china and other foreign countries 
our net sales are denominated primarily in us dollars  euros and chinese renminbi 
changing exchange rates often impact our financial results and our period over period comparisons 
this is particularly true of movements in the us dollar s exchange rate with the chinese renminbi and the euro  and each of these and other foreign currencies relative to each other 
sales and net earnings denominated in currencies other than the us dollar may result in higher or lower net sales and net earnings upon translation for our us dollar denominated consolidated financial statements 
for example  sales in certain divisions of our power and wireless segments are denominated primarily in renminbi and euro 
also  net earnings may be affected by the mix of sales and expenses by currency within each of our product groups 
foreign currency gains or losses may be incurred when non functional currency denominated transactions are remeasured to an operation s functional currency for financial reporting purposes 
an increase in the percentage of our transactions denominated in non us currencies may result in increased foreign exchange exposure on our consolidated statements of operations 
for example  we have experienced approximately million in net foreign exchange losses during the year ended december   primarily due to intercompany transactions denominated in varying currencies 
in addition  we may also experience a positive or negative translation adjustment to equity because our investments in non us dollar functional subsidiaries may translate to more or less us dollars in our us consolidated financial statements 
in order to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations  we may purchase foreign exchange forward contracts and or currency options 
these contracts guarantee a predetermined exchange rate or range of rates at the time the contract is purchased 
this allows us to shift the majority of the risk of currency fluctuation from the date of the contract to a third party for a fee 
in determining the use of forward exchange contracts and currency options  we consider the amount of sales  purchases and net assets or liabilities denominated in local currencies  the currency to be hedged and the costs associated with the contracts 
at december   we had six foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding to sell forward approximately million euro  or approximately million  to receive chinese renminbi 
the fair value of these forward contracts was a liability of million as determined through use of level fair value inputs as defined in the fair value hierarchy of topic in the financial accounting standards board s fasb accounting standards codification asc 
these contracts are used to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations at our chinese operations 
at december   we had seven foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding to sell forward approximately million euro  or approximately million  to receive chinese renminbi 
the fair value of these forward contracts was a liability of million as determined through use of level fair value inputs 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate is affected by the proportion of our income earned in higher tax jurisdictions  such as those in europe and the united states  and income earned in lower tax jurisdictions  such as hong kong and china 
this mix of income can vary significantly from one period to another 
additionally  our effective income tax rate will be impacted from period to period by significant transactions and the deductibility of certain financing costs  severance and impairment costs and other similar costs 
changes in operations  tax legislation  estimates  judgments and forecasts may also affect our tax rate from period to period 
we have benefited over the years from favorable tax incentives and other tax policies 
however  there is no guarantee as to how long these benefits will continue to exist  which could materially impact our consolidated financials statements 
except in limited circumstances  we have not provided for us income and foreign withholding taxes on our non us subsidiaries undistributed earnings 
such earnings may include our pre acquisition earnings of foreign entities acquired through stock purchases  which  with the exception of approximately million  are intended to be reinvested outside of the us indefinitely 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures  in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  requires us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements on pages through describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
these critical accounting policies are subject to review by the audit committee of our board of directors 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for inventory  divestitures  acquisitions  goodwill and identifiable intangibles  income taxes  defined benefit plans  contingency accruals and severance and asset impairments 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements inventory valuation 
we carry our inventories at lower of cost or market 
inventory provisions are created to write down excess and obsolete inventory to market value 
we utilize historical trends and customer forecasts to estimate the expected usage of our inventory that is on hand 
the establishment of inventory provisions requires judgments and estimates which may change over time and may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates 
however  we do not believe that a reasonable change in these assumptions would result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  inventory purchases are based upon estimates of future demand that are based upon customer forecasts and the trend of product sales over recent historical periods 
if there is a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products or there is a higher risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements  than we may be required to write down our inventory which would cause a negative impact to gross margin 
however  if we were subsequently able to sell or use a significant portion of inventory that was previously written down  our gross margin could be positively affected 
divestiture accounting 
we engage in divestitures to streamline our operations  to focus on our core businesses  to reduce our external debt and to strengthen our financial position 
when the operations and cash flows of the divestiture have been or will be eliminated from our ongoing operations and  also  when we do not expect to have any significant continuing involvement with such operations  we may report the component that has either been disposed of  or is classified as held for sale  as a discontinued operation 
if we plan to dispose of the component by sale  we are required to report the divested component at the lower of its carrying amount or at its fair value less costs to sell in the period it is classified as held for sale 
these assessments require judgments and estimates which include determining when it is appropriate to classify the component as held for sale  if the component meets the specifications of a discontinued operation  determining the fair value of the component and determining the level and type of involvement  if any  we will have with the disposed component in the future 
furthermore  when removing the divested component from our consolidated balance sheets  and  if necessary  restating results in prior periods  we are required to make assumptions  judgments and estimates regarding  among other things  the assets  liabilities and activities of the component and their relation to our continuing businesses 
purchase accounting 
the purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair market values  with the excess recorded as goodwill 
such fair market value assessments require judgments and estimates which may change over time and may cause the final amounts to differ materially from their original estimates 
these adjustments to fair value assessments are recorded to goodwill over the purchase price allocation period which cannot exceed twelve months 
goodwill and identifiable intangibles 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization  indefinite lived intangible assets and property  plant and equipment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant changes in the use of any asset  changes in historical trends in operating performance  changes in projected operating performance  declines in stock price  failure to pass step one of our annual goodwill impairment test and significant negative economic trends 
prior to  we had goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets subject to an annual impairment review 
the annual review of our goodwill and our indefinite lived intangible assets is performed in our fourth fiscal quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of a potential impairment exist  to determine if the carrying amount of these intangible assets are impaired 
the impairment review process compares the fair value of each reporting unit  where goodwill resides  with its carrying value 
if the net book value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we perform the second step of the impairment test that requires an allocation of the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  with any residual fair value being allocated to goodwill 
an impairment charge is recognized only when the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill is less than its carrying amount 
we have identified three reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes  which are our legacy electronics unit  including our power and network segments but excluding a component of our connector product line known as fre  our wireless reporting unit and fre 

table of contents our impairment review incorporates both an income and comparable companies market approach to estimate potential impairment 
we believe the use of multiple valuation techniques results in a more accurate indicator of the fair value of each reporting unit  rather than the use of only an income approach 
the income approach is based on estimating future cash flows using various growth assumptions and discounting based on a present value factor 
we develop the future net cash flows during our annual budget process  which is completed in our fourth fiscal quarter of each year 
however  estimates of future cash flows are updated in conjunction with any goodwill recoverability analysis that is performed independent of our annual review 
the growth rates we use are an estimate of the future growth in the industries in which we participate and are adjusted  if necessary  for issues specific to our business and our position in the industry 
our discount rate assumption is based on an estimated cost of capital  which we determine annually based on market participant estimated costs of debt and equity relative to our capital structure 
the comparable companies market approach considers the trading multiples of our peer companies to compute our estimated fair value 
the majority of the comparable companies utilized in our evaluation are included in the dow jones us electrical components and equipment industry group index 
as a result of an unexpected decline in the actual and forecasted sales and operating profit of our wireless reporting unit  we performed step one of the goodwill impairment test in the first quarter of our wireless reporting unit did not pass the first step of the impairment test 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test resulted in a million impairment to wireless goodwill 
the assumptions used in the impairment test performed at march  were consistent with those used in our annual impairment review  except for the impact of a new outlook on business related to a major customer of our wireless reporting unit and the overall decline in the forecasted operating results for our wireless reporting unit 
in addition to the impairment  we performed step one of the goodwill impairment test during the first quarter of as a result of the decline in our stock price and decrease in our forecasted operating profit  which our wireless reporting unit failed 
the second step of the impairment test yielded a million goodwill impairment at our wireless reporting unit 
refer to note  goodwill and other intangible assets  to the consolidated financial statements for additional details 
the determination of the fair value of the reporting units and the allocation of that value to the individual assets and liabilities within those reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  the selection of the appropriate discount rate  terminal growth rates  forecasted net cash flows  appropriate peer group companies and control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we participate 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in these assumptions  actual findings could differ from those estimates 
changes in assumptions concerning projected financial results or any of the other underlying assumptions would have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting unit or the amount of the goodwill impairment charge 
additionally  significant changes in any of these estimates or assumptions in the future may result in a future impairment 
changes in key assumptions would affect the goodwill impairments recognized in and as follows in millions  except assumption percentages impairment increase decrease assumption basis points basis points discount rate terminal growth rate control premium impairment increase decrease assumption basis points basis points discount rate terminal growth rate control premium as of december   we did not have any goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets 
therefore  our annual review of goodwill was no longer required to be performed in the fourth quarter of as part of our annual review of indefinite lived intangible assets  we tested the carrying value of our tradenames  which resulted in approximately million of impairment to one of our tradenames recorded during the fourth quarter of in the second quarter of  we decided to further simplify our operations by considering alternatives to withdraw from the audio market 
as a result  we performed a recoverability test on the finite lived intangible assets related to our audio products  which resulted in a million impairment to our technology intangibles 
as a result of a significant decline in wireless actual and forecasted sales and operating profit during the first quarter of  we performed a recoverability test on a finite lived customer relationship intangible asset which resulted in an million impairment charge 
also  due to the adverse changes in our forecasted operating profit that led to the goodwill impairment realized in the first quarter of  we performed a recoverability test on certain definite and indefinite lived intangible assets that yielded no impairment 
refer to note  goodwill and other intangible assets  of the consolidated financial statements for additional details 

table of contents assigning useful lives and periodically reassessing the useful lives of intangible assets is predicated on various assumptions 
also  the fair values of our intangible assets are impacted by factors such as changes in technology  declines in demand that lead to excess capacity and changes in other factors 
in addition to the various assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above  we may strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring  disposition or otherwise exiting businesses in response to changes in industry or market conditions  which may result in an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets 
while we believe the estimates and assumptions used in determining the fair value of goodwill and identifiable assets are reasonable  a change in those assumptions could affect their valuation and carrying values 
income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense or benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and  also  for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and  also  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates  relative to our provision for income taxes  take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law  or our interpretation of tax laws  and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of our deferred tax assets also takes into account predictions of the amount and the categories of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amounts and categories of income in future years could result in our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes being inaccurate 
in accordance with the recognition standards established  we regularly perform a comprehensive review of uncertain tax positions 
in this regard  an uncertain tax position represents our expected treatment of a tax position taken in a filed tax return  or planned to be taken in a future tax return  that has not been reflected in measuring income tax expense for financial reporting purposes 
until these positions are verified by the taxing authorities  or the statutes of limitations otherwise expire  we have recorded such positions as liabilities for uncertain tax positions in our consolidated balance sheets 
defined benefit plans 
on december   our management froze the plan benefits of our domestic defined benefit retirement plan 
also  during  we settled the obligations under our defined benefit supplemental retirement plan  which was contingent on the sale of electrical 
the costs and obligations of our defined benefit plans are dependent on actuarial assumptions 
the three most critical assumptions used which impact our net periodic pension expense income and our benefit obligation are the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase 
the discount rate is determined based on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of expected benefit payments 
for our pension obligations in the united states  a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with varying maturities is used to discount our expected benefit payments to their present value 
this generates our discount rate assumption for our domestic pension plans 
for our foreign plans  we use market rates for high quality corporate bonds to derive our discount rate assumption 
the expected return on plan assets represents a forward projection of the average rate of earnings expected from our invested pension assets 
we have estimated this rate based on historical returns of similarly diversified portfolios 
the rate of compensation increase represents the long term assumption for expected increases to salaries for pay related plans 
these three assumptions are evaluated annually 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts  as well as a change in future contributions to the plans 
however  we do not believe that a reasonable change in these assumptions would result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
refer to note  employee benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements for further details of the primary assumptions used in determining the cost and obligations of our defined benefit plans 
contingency accruals 
during the normal course of business  a variety of issues arise which may result in litigation  environmental compliance and other contingent obligations 
in developing our contingency accruals  we consider both the likelihood of a loss or incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of exposure 
we record contingency accruals when a liability is probable and the amount of exposure can be reasonably estimated 
we periodically evaluate available information to assess whether contingency accruals should be adjusted  which includes an assessment of legal interpretations  judicial proceedings  recent case law and specific changes or developments regarding known claims 
in future periods  we could be required to record additional expenses  if our initial estimates were too low  or reverse part of the charges that were initially recorded  if our estimates were too high 
additionally  the litigation costs we incur in connection with a contingency are expensed as incurred  since the nature of these costs is generally unpredictable and cannot be reasonably estimated prior to being incurred 

table of contents severance  impairment and other associated costs 
we record severance  asset impairments and other charges  such as contract terminations costs  in response to declines in demand that lead to excess capacity  changing technology and other factors 
these costs  which we refer to as restructuring costs  are expensed when we determine that we have incurred those costs and  also  the requirements for accrual have been met in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance 
restructuring costs are recorded based upon our best estimates at the time the action is initiated 
our actual expenditures for the restructuring activities may differ from the initially recorded costs 
if this occurs  we could be required either to record additional expenses in future periods  if our initial estimates were too low  or reverse part of the initial charges  if our initial estimates were too high 
additionally  the cash flow impact of an activity may not be recognized in the same period the expense has been incurred 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements in january  fasb issued an accounting standards update asu which requires additional disclosures related to transfers between levels in the hierarchy of fair value measurement 
this asu was effective for periods beginning after december  adoption of these provisions did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
in january   fasb issued an asu to clarify the change in ownership guidance and to expand the required disclosures for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
this asu was effective for periods beginning after december  adoption of these provisions did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements in october  fasb issued an asu to address the accounting for multiple deliverable sales arrangements 
this update provided guidance to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately  rather than as a combined unit 
this asu also expanded the required disclosures related to a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this guidance is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we are currently evaluating the effect that this asu may have on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the table below shows our results of operations and the changes in those results from period to period in both us dollars and percentages dollars in thousands results as of net sales change change net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses severance  impairment and other associated costs operating loss interest expense  net other expense income  net loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense net loss from continuing operations net loss from discontinued operations net loss net sales 
our consolidated net sales increased by primarily as a result of the improved net sales of our network and power segments particularly in our local area network  power management and automotive products 
partially offsetting this improvement was a decrease in the demand for the products of our wireless segment in both the mobile handset and audio markets 
the decreased demand in the mobile handset market was primarily caused by the loss of certain business with a major oem customer due to a sourcing change  which began in the second half of additionally  we experienced lower us dollar reported sales in the year ended december  as compared to the prior year due to adverse changes in the foreign exchange rates of our non us dollar sales 
gross profit 
our consolidated gross profit margin for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in our gross profit margin during the year ended december  was primarily the result of lower margins incurred by our wireless segment caused by excess capacity due to the loss of certain business with a major oem customer  accelerated depreciation realized on certain assets of wireless and power that became idle during and higher labor costs resulting from increased minimum wage rates in our manufacturing facilities in china 
also  the results for the year ended december  were positively affected by business interruption insurance proceeds related to an earthquake that occurred in mianyang  china during partially offsetting these decreases to our gross profit were cost reduction and price increasing initiatives  the positive effects of manufacturing cost absorption from increased sales volume at network and power  a mix of sales in certain higher margin products and improved labor costs caused by a transition of operations to regions in china with lower wage rates 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses 
total selling  general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to additional selling and marketing expenses caused by higher sales and  also  additional legal and incentive compensation costs 
partially offsetting these increases was lower intangible amortization caused by the impairment charge recorded on certain finite intangible assets during the first six months of and a curtailment gain that resulted from freezing our domestic defined benefit retirement plan at the end of for the year ended december   we were able to leverage our increased revenue on consistent selling  general and administrative spending which caused our selling  general and administrative expense  as a percentage of sales  to decline from the comparable period of research  development and engineering expenses rd e are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december  and december   respectively  rd e was as follows in thousands rd e percentage of sales rd e increased in the year ended december  primarily due to the inclusion of approximately million of legal expenses incurred in conjunction with a patent claim in which we are a defendant 
without the effects of the additional legal expenses  our rd e  as a percentage of sales  was approximately 
our spending on rd e activities tends to develop at a rate which is less dramatic than our sales changes 
due to the increased level of sales we experienced in the year ended december   our rd e as a percentage of sales was lower than historical levels 
we believe that future sales in the electronic components markets will be driven by next generation products 
as a result  design and development activities with our oem customers continue at an aggressive pace consistent with our markets activity 
severance  impairment and other associated costs 
during the year ended december   we determined that approximately million of our wireless reporting unit s goodwill and identifiable intangible assets were impaired  including million of technology related to our audio products 
also  we recorded an impairment of million to one of our indefinite lived tradenames 
refer to note  goodwill and other intangible assets  to our consolidated financial statements for further details 
additionally  we incurred a charge of million for a number of cost reduction actions 
these charges include severance and related payments of million and fixed asset impairments of million 
the impaired assets were identified in and primarily include machinery and equipment which were unable to be cost efficiently repaired or refitted for other manufacturing purposes 
during the year ended december   we determined that approximately million of our wireless reporting unit s goodwill was impaired 
additionally  we incurred a charge of million for a number of cost reduction actions 
these charges include severance and related payments of million and fixed asset impairments of million 
the impaired assets were identified in and primarily include production lines associated with products that have no expected future demand and two real estate properties which were disposed 
interest 
net interest expense increased primarily as a result of the interest expense incurred on the convertible senior notes we issued during the fourth quarter of lower interest was incurred on borrowings from our credit facility during the year ended december   because our debt outstanding under the facility decreased 
in both and  interest on our outstanding loans and amortization of capitalized loan fees related to our credit agreement were allocated between continuing operations and discontinued operations on a pro rata basis  based upon the debt repaid from the disposition of each of our discontinued operations as compared to our total debt outstanding 
other 
other expense or income is primarily attributable to our net foreign exchange activity on intercompany loans and advances among varying currencies 
during the year ended december   we incurred foreign exchange losses of approximately million as compared to foreign exchange gains of approximately million during the comparable period of the increase in foreign exchange losses was due to the overall strengthening of the us dollar to euro during the year ended december  as compared to a weakening of the us dollar to euro in the same period of also  included in net other expense for the year ended december  was a loss recorded to write down an available for sale property to the net proceeds received on its sale 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to a tax rate of for the year ended december  the change in our effective tax rate is primarily due to lower goodwill impairment charges in compared to  the expiration of certain non us tax holidays and reduced losses and non deductible expenses incurred in certain jurisdictions where we expect limited tax benefits 

table of contents discontinued operations 
net loss from discontinued operations was approximately million during the year ended december  as compared to a loss of approximately million in the year ended december  the loss from discontinued operations in the year ended december  was primarily attributable to a charge to reduce the net assets of electrical to the net proceeds we received upon the completion of its sale 
the loss from discontinued operations incurred during the year ended december  was primarily attributable to estimated losses to write down the net assets of electrical to the net proceeds we anticipated receiving from the disposition and a charge to reduce the net assets of medtech and mems to the actual net proceeds we received upon the completion of each sale 
also  we recorded estimates for the settlement of certain accelerated retirement plan benefits at both electrical and medtech during the year ended december  a summary of our net loss from each of our discontinued operations for the years ended december  and december  is as follows in thousands electrical medtech mems total year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the table below shows our results of operations and the changes in those results from period to period in both us dollars and percentages dollars in thousands results as of net sales change change net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses severance  impairment and other associated costs operating loss interest expense  net other income  net loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense benefit net loss from continuing operations net loss from discontinued operations net loss net sales 
our consolidated net sales decreased by as a result of the decline in customer demand resulting from the adverse developments in the global economy 
the overall demand reduction realized during the year ended december  was incurred generally across our network  power and wireless segments 
however  demand began to improve in the second half of in most markets 
also  a stronger us dollar relative to the euro experienced during the year ended december  as compared to the same period of resulted in lower us dollar reported sales 

table of contents gross profit 
our consolidated gross profit margin for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the increase in our gross profit margin during the year ended december  was primarily the result of the positive effects of cost reduction and price increasing activities initiated in late as a response to the adverse conditions in the global economy 
partially offsetting these activities was a decline in operating leverage as a result of decreased sales generally across our network  power and wireless segments during selling  general and administrative expenses 
total selling  general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to an overall emphasis on measures to reduce costs that were initiated at the end of in response to the overall economic downturn 
these measures reduced expenses across virtually all our administrative areas 
also  intangible amortization expense declined compared to the period as a result of the impairment charges on finite lived intangibles which were recorded in the fourth quarter of research  development and engineering expenses rd e are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
for the years ended december  and december   respectively  rd e was as follows in thousands rd e percentage of sales the decrease in research  development and engineering expenses is due to our cost reducing initiative that began at the end of however  as a percentage of sales  spending was at a higher level as compared to the period 
we believe that future sales in the electronic components markets will be driven by next generation products 
as a result  design and development activities with our oem customers continue at an aggressive pace consistent with market activity 
severance  impairment and other associated costs 
during the year ended december   we determined that approximately million of our wireless reporting unit s goodwill was impaired 
additionally  we incurred a charge of million for a number of cost reduction actions 
these charges include severance and related payments of million and fixed asset impairments of million 
the impaired assets were identified in and primarily include production lines associated with products that have no expected future demand and two real estate properties which were disposed 
during  we determined that million of goodwill and other intangibles were impaired  including million of goodwill and identifiable intangibles of a discontinued operation 
additionally  we incurred a charge of million for a number of cost reduction actions 
these charges include severance and related payments and other associated costs of million resulting from the termination of certain manufacturing and support personnel in asia  europe and north america and  also  million of other costs that primarily resulted from the transfer of manufacturing operations from europe and north africa to asia 
we also recorded fixed asset impairments of million 
the impaired assets were identified in and primarily include machinery and equipment that were unable to be cost efficiently repaired or refitted for other manufacturing purposes 
interest 
net interest expense increased primarily as a result of the accelerated amortization of capitalized loan fees resulting from credit facility amendments effective in interest on our outstanding loans and amortization of capitalized loan fees were allocated between continuing and discontinued operations on a pro rata basis for the year ended december  and the comparable period in  based upon the actual and expected debt to be repaid as a result of the dispositions compared to total debt outstanding 
also  interest income in the year ended december  was significantly lower than the comparable period in due to lower average cash balances during other 
the decrease in other income was primarily attributable to lower net foreign exchange gains realized during the year ended december  of million  as compared to net foreign exchange gains of million incurred in the comparable period of the primary reason for the decrease in foreign exchange gains during the year ended december  was due to the effects of a larger strengthening of the us dollar to euro exchange rate during as compared to income taxes 
the effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the effective tax rate was affected by the million of goodwill impairment charges recorded in which were non deductible 
in addition  the tax rate was negatively impacted by certain losses and restructuring charges incurred by entities in jurisdictions where the future tax benefit is unlikely to be realized 

table of contents discontinued operations 
net loss from discontinued operations was approximately million during the year ended december  as compared to a loss of approximately million in the year ended december  the loss from discontinued operations incurred during the year ended december  was primarily attributable to estimated losses to write down the net assets of electrical to the net proceeds we anticipated receiving from the disposition and  also  a charge to reduce the net assets of medtech and mems to the actual net proceeds we received upon the completion of each sale 
also  we recorded estimates for the settlement of certain accelerated retirement plan benefits at both electrical and medtech during the year ended december  the loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets at medtech 
a summary of our net loss from each of our discontinued operations for the years ended december  and december  is as follows in thousands electrical medtech mems total business outlook our levels of net sales  customer mix and product mix have a significant impact on our gross margin  results of operations and cash flow 
specifically  we achieved sales and operating profit during the second and third fiscal quarters of that were significantly above any of our recent periods 
this was primarily a result of increased sales volume across network and power  a mix of sales in higher margin products and our focus on containing our selling  general and administrative costs 
however  we anticipate that our sales and operating profit in the first quarter of will be lower than our levels in the fourth quarter of our profit margins continue to be challenged across all of our segments by increasing wage rates and material costs 
in addition  we expect network s margins to decrease due to lower prices which are effective during the first quarter of also  wireless continues to be negatively impacted by a lack of capacity utilization 
to address these issues  we continue to focus on transitioning our operations from locations with higher wage rates  such as those in southern china  to lower cost areas in the central regions of china 
also  we continue our efforts toward streamlining our overall general and administrative expenses to achieve an optimal level of spending that is appropriate for the size and structure of our company 
we continue to commit resources to the development of new technologies and products that have higher forecasted margins  to the automation of certain manual manufacturing processes and to the expansion of our international sales  marketing and engineering teams in regions closest to our customers 
also  we plan on continuing to adjust our marketing and engineering efforts at wireless in order to increase revenue streams from a more diverse base of customers 
our focus will be on wireless products with higher forecasted margins  while shifting from those markets where we expect limited returns  such as wireless audio components  to streamline our operations and further simplify our business 
considering the business issues mentioned above and other risks inherent in our company  we believe we have ample liquidity to fund our business requirements 
this belief is based on our current balances of cash and cash equivalents  our history of positive operating cash flows  including million for the year ended december   and access to our credit facility 
our credit agreement requires that we maintain certain financial covenants which are measured at the end of each fiscal quarter 
the primary covenants are senior secured debt and fixed charges compared to our rolling four quarter ebitda  as defined by our credit agreement 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants of our credit agreement 
we substantially decreased our borrowings from the credit facility with the proceeds of the electrical divestiture in september and through the issuance of million of convertible senior notes in december  which are not subject to the leverage or fixed charge covenant calculations in our credit agreement 
accordingly  we believe that we will continue generating sufficient ebitda in the foreseeable future to remain compliant with our debt covenants 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital as of december  was million  compared to million as of december  the decrease of million was primarily due to the sale of electrical s net assets  that were held for sale as of december   and declines in accounts receivable and inventory  which were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable 
cash and cash equivalents  which are included in working capital  decreased million from million as of december  to million as of december  
table of contents we present our statement of cash flows using the indirect method 
our management has found that investors and analysts typically refer to changes in accounts receivable  inventory and other components of working capital when analyzing operating cash flows 
also  changes in working capital are more directly related to the way we manage our business cash flow than items such as cash receipts from the sale of goods  which would appear using the direct method 
all cash flows from our discontinued operations have been separated from continuing operations and are disclosed in aggregate by each cash flow activity 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to million in the comparable period of  a decrease of million 
the decrease is primarily attributable to reductions in net working capital changes in the year ended december  which were less than the reductions during the year ended december  capital expenditures were million during the year ended december  and million in the increase of million primarily resulted from our focus on allocating resources toward next generation technologies during compared to a concerted effort to limit new investment to only essential programs in we make capital expenditures to expand production capacity and to improve our operating efficiency 
we plan to continue making such expenditures at a similar or increased manner in the future when necessary 
we paid million for dividend payments during the year ended december  on november  we announced a quarterly cash dividend of per common share  payable on january  to shareholders of record on january  this quarterly dividend resulted in a cash payment to shareholders of approximately million in the first quarter of we expect cash payments for dividends to be approximately million in on september   we completed the sale of the electrical business in europe and asia for approximately million  subject to normal working capital and other financial adjustments 
in the fourth quarter of  we contributed approximately million to fund an irrevocable grantor trust that was designated for benefit payments to participants under our defined benefit supplemental retirement plan  which was contingent on the sale of electrical 
following the sale of electrical s operations in europe and asia  we made benefit payments of approximately million and incurred approximately million of special termination benefits to settle the obligations under our defined benefit supplemental retirement plan 
the remaining proceeds from the electrical disposition  net of the defined benefit plan settlement  transaction fees and other related costs  were used in the third quarter of to reduce debt outstanding under our credit facility 
on january   we completed the sale of electrical s north american business for an amount immaterial to our consolidated financial statements 
the net proceeds were primarily used to repay debt outstanding under our credit facility 
our domestic defined benefit retirement plan is currently under audit by the pension benefit guarantee corporation pbgc 
initial communications from the pbgc have indicated that the sale of electrical s north american operations may have resulted in a partial plan termination  which may require us to accelerate the funding of up to approximately million to this defined benefit plan 
however  a partial plan termination would only result in a cash payment to fund our plan assets and will not directly result in additional expenses 
as of the date these financial statements were issued  we were continuing discussions with the pbgc on this matter 
at december  our management froze the plan benefits under our domestic defined benefit retirement plan  which resulted in a curtailment gain of approximately million recognized in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  on december   we finalized an amendment to our credit agreement that permitted us to issue senior convertible notes and restated certain other provisions of our previous credit agreement 
the amended and restated credit agreement provides for a million senior revolving credit facility and provides for borrowing in us dollars  euros and yen  with a multicurrency facility providing for the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed the us dollar equivalent of million 
our credit agreement requires that we maintain certain financial covenants which are measured at the end of each fiscal quarter 
the primary covenants are total debt  excluding our convertible senior notes  and fixed charges as compared to our rolling twelve month ebitda 
if we are unable to maintain the required ebitda levels relative to our total debt  excluding our convertible senior notes  or fixed charges  we would default on our covenants 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants of our credit agreement 
we had approximately million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility with approximately million of borrowing capacity as of december  refer to note  debt  to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

table of contents we had three standby letters of credit outstanding in the aggregate amount of million securing transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business  which are included in our maximum borrowing capacity as december  on december   we issued million in convertible senior notes  which will mature on december  the notes bear a coupon rate of per annum that is payable semi annually in arrears on june and december of each year 
during the year ended december   we paid approximately million of interest related to the semi annual coupon rate on the convertible senior notes 
we expect to pay a total of million of interest on those notes in we incurred debt issuance costs of approximately million in  which have been deferred and are being amortized over the life of the notes 
refer to note  debt  to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
the net decrease in cash resulting from cash flows of our discontinued operations was million for the year ended december  cash used in operating activities of our discontinued operations was approximately million  which primarily resulted from changes in working capital and the net losses of these operations excluding depreciation  amortization and impairment charges 
our discontinued operations also had capital expenditures of approximately million and cash on hand  that we retained in the disposition  of approximately million  which were both included in our investing cash outflows from discontinued operations 
we do not expect these uses of cash to recur and we also do not expect significant continuing cash flows from these operations after their disposition 
we are a party to various legal proceedings  claims and assessments that arise in the ordinary course of business  and may continue to incur significant costs in defending or settling legal matters 
the total amount and timing of the expected future payments related to these matters cannot be estimated due to the uncertainty of the duration of the legal proceedings and the ultimate scope of other claims 
however  an unfavorable outcome in a single matter or in multiple legal matters during the same reporting period could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results from operations and cash flows 
we are a defendant in a lawsuit filed in july by halo electronics  inc in the united states district court  district of nevada 
the case is captioned halo electronics  inc v 
pulse engineering  inc 
and technitrol  inc  case no 
cv pmp pal 
the plaintiff claims that we infringed certain u 
s  patents related to an electronic surface mount package and is seeking injunctive relief and damages 
discovery has been completed and summary judgment motions are now pending 
the parties have requested that the trial begin in our second fiscal quarter of  but a trial date has not yet been scheduled 
we believe we have complete defenses to all claims asserted and therefore have no liability to the plaintiff 
however  the plaintiff has produced expert reports asserting infringement and liability in the amount of million  plus trebling and attorneys fees  and a judgment in favor of the plaintiff may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results from operations and cash flows 
during  we incurred approximately million of legal expenses related to this matter 
during  we expect to settle an audit related to one of our subsidiary s income tax filings 
this potential audit settlement could result in a cash payment of as much as million 
we are currently in negotiations to sell the audio business of our wireless segment and expect an agreement of sale to be finalized during the first quarter of the net proceeds are estimated to be immaterial to our consolidated financial statements 
on february   we announced that our corporate headquarters  currently located in trevose  pennsylvania  will be consolidated into our us operational headquarters in san diego  california 
we are now a pure play electronic components provider  which has made a corporate structure with a stand alone corporate headquarters and senior managers at two locations no longer efficient 
this consolidation will occur in in connection with our actions to simplify and streamline our company s organizational structure 
we estimate that we will incur approximately million of severance and other associated costs over and related to the consolidation of our headquarters  which will generate an estimated annual cost savings of approximately million once the transition is complete 
the principal material change in our contractual obligations during the year ended december  was the elimination of obligations related to our former electrical operations in europe  asia and north america  which included outstanding commercial commitments under precious metal consignment type leases of approximately million as of december  also  the contractual obligations related to our defined benefit supplemental retirement plan were settled during the year ended december  
table of contents as of december   future payments related to contractual obligations were as follows in thousands amounts expected to be paid by period total less than year to years to years thereafter long term debt convertible senior notes estimated interest payments operating leases retirement plans excludes other obligations under employment contracts that are generally only payable upon a change of control 
in the schedule of estimated future payments related to our contractual obligations  we excluded unrecognized tax benefits due to the uncertainty of the amount and the period of payment 
as of december   we had unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million 
refer to note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the combination of cash on hand  cash generated by operations and  if necessary  borrowings under our credit agreement will be sufficient to satisfy our operating cash requirements in the foreseeable future 
in addition  we may use internally generated funds or obtain additional borrowings or equity offerings for suitable acquisitions of businesses or assets 
currently  a majority owned subsidiary holds approximately million of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents 
permanent access to funds from this subsidiary could be in the form of a dividend to its shareholders  which could result in income withholding taxes and distributions to minority shareholders 
as of december  there are no plans to repatriate funds held at this majority owned subsidiary 
during the first quarter of  this majority owned subsidiary announced a plan to purchase its own common stock that is publically traded on a foreign exchange 
as of the date these financial statements were issued  the majority owned subsidiary purchased approximately million of its own common stock with its cash on hand 
such spending may continue under similar common stock buy back plans in the foreseeable future 
with the exception of the cash and cash equivalents located at the majority owned subsidiary  we have not experienced any significant liquidity restrictions in any country in which we operate and no restrictions are foreseen 
however  foreign exchange ceilings imposed by local governments and the sometimes lengthy approval processes which foreign governments require for international cash transfers may delay our internal cash movements from time to time 
we expect to reinvest this cash and earnings outside of the united states  because we anticipate that a significant portion of our opportunities for future growth will be abroad 
in addition  we expect to use a significant portion of the cash to service debt outside the united states 
thus  with the exception of earnings in the amount of million  we have not provided for us federal and state income and foreign withholding taxes on approximately million of our non us subsidiaries undistributed earnings that have been indefinitely invested abroad 
if these earnings were brought back to the united states  significant tax liabilities could be incurred in the united states as several countries in which we operate have tax rates significantly lower than the us statutory rate 
our retained earnings are free from legal or contractual restrictions as of december   with the exception of approximately million of subsidiary retained earnings primarily in china  that are restricted in accordance with section of the prc foreign investment enterprises law 
the million includes approximately million of retained earnings of a majority owned subsidiary 
the amount restricted in accordance with the prc foreign investment enterprise law is applicable to all foreign investment enterprises doing business in china 
the restriction applies to of our net earnings in china  limited to of the total capital invested 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our financial instruments  including cash and cash equivalents and long term debt borrowed under our revolving credit facility  are exposed to changes in interest rates in both the us and abroad 
we invest our excess cash in short term  investment grade interest bearing securities 
we generally limit our exposure to any one financial institution to the extent practical 
our board of directors has adopted policies relating to these risks and continually monitors compliance with these policies 

table of contents our revolving credit facility has variable interest rates 
accordingly  interest expense may increase if we borrow and or if the rates associated with our borrowings increase 
in addition  we may pursue additional or alternative financing 
we may also use financial derivatives such as interest rate swaps or other instruments in order to manage the risk associated with changes in market interest rates 
however  we have not used any of these instruments to date 
we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements  transactions  obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities in our consolidated financial statements which would materially affect our current or future financial condition or results from operations 
the table below presents principal amounts in us dollars and the related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our debt obligations

fair value liabilities convertible senior notes fixed rate us dollar weighted average interest rate long term debt variable rate us dollar weighted average interest rate the weighted average interest rate reflects the applicable interest rate as of december  and is subject to change in accordance with the terms of our amended credit facility 
foreign currency risk as of december   we had a substantial amount of assets denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we conduct business in various foreign currencies  including those of non hyperinflationary emerging market countries in asia as well as european countries 
we may utilize derivative financial instruments  such as forward exchange contracts in connection with fair value hedges  to manage foreign currency risks 
gains and losses related to fair value hedges are recognized in income along with adjustments of carrying amounts of the hedged items 
therefore  all of our forward exchange contracts are marked to market  and unrealized gains and losses are included in current period net income 
these contracts guarantee a predetermined rate of exchange at the time the contract is purchased 
this allows us to shift the majority of the risk of currency fluctuations from the date of the contract to a third party for a fee 
we believe there are two primary risks of holding these instruments 
the first is that the foreign currency being hedged could move in a direction which would create a better economic outcome than if the hedging instrument was not in place 
the second risk is that the counterparty to a currency hedge defaults on its obligations 
we reduce the risk of counterparty default by entering into relatively short term hedges with well capitalized and highly rated banks 
in determining the use of forward exchange contracts  we consider the amount of sales and purchases made in local currencies  the type of currency and the costs associated with the contracts 
during the year ended december   we utilized forward contracts to sell forward euro to receive chinese renminbi 
these contracts are used to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations at our operations in china 
at december   we had six foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding to sell forward approximately million euro  or approximately million  to receive chinese renminbi 
the fair value of these forward contracts was a liability of million as determined through use of level inputs as defined in asc topic at december   we had seven foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding to sell forward approximately million euro  or approximately million  to receive chinese renminbi 
the fair value of these forward contracts was a liability of million as determined through use of level inputs
