risk factors 
the information below has been adjusted to reflect the impact of the restatement of our financial results which is more fully described in note b restatement of financial statements to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k and under the paragraph restatement of previously issued consolidated financial statements below and does not reflect any subsequent information or events occurring after the date of the filing of our reports originally presenting the financial information being restated or update any disclosure herein to reflect the passage of time since the date of such filings 
restatement of previously issued consolidated financial statements as discussed above under item  restatement of previously issued consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k  we have restated our previously issued consolidated financial statements and related disclosures for the fiscal year ended march  and each of the quarterly consolidated financial statements for the periods ended june  through december  to account for our transactions under our orion throughput agreements  or otas  as sales type leases instead of as operating leases 
our prior method of accounting for ota transactions as operating leases deferred revenue recognition over the full term of the ota contracts  only recognizing revenue on a monthly basis as customer payments are due  while the upfront sales  general and administrative expenses related to these ota contracts were recognized immediately 
generally  this change in accounting treatment has resulted in no impact to our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  or overall cash flow  an increase in our revenue of million and million for our full fiscal years and  respectively  an increase in our net income of million and earnings per share of for our full fiscal year and a reduction in our net loss of million and loss per share of for our full fiscal year  an increase in our current assets of million and total assets of million and an increase in our total shareholders equity of million for our fiscal year and an increase in our current assets of million and total assets of million and an increase in our total shareholders equity of million and a decrease in our total liabilities of million for our fiscal year  and an increase in our net cash used in operating activities of million  a decrease in net our cash used in investing activities of million and an increase in our net cash provided by financing activities of million for our fiscal year and an increase in our net cash used in operating activities of million and a decrease in net our cash used in investing activities of million for our fiscal year  and an increase in our revenue  net income and earnings per share for the first three quarters of each of our fiscal years and and a decrease in revenue  net income and earnings per share for the last quarter of our fiscal year we do not plan to amend our previously filed annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended march  due to the restatement of our previously issued consolidated financial statements and related disclosures for the fiscal year ended march  contained herein 
however  we plan to amend our quarterly reports on form q for the periods ended june  through december  to reflect the restatements described in this annual report on form k

overview we design  manufacture and implement energy management systems consisting primarily of high performance  energy efficient lighting systems  controls and related services 
we currently generate the substantial majority of our revenue from sales of high intensity fluorescent  or hif  lighting systems and related services to commercial and industrial customers 
we typically sell our hif lighting systems in replacement of our customers existing high intensity discharge  or hid  fixtures 
we call this replacement process a retrofit 
we frequently engage our customer s existing electrical contractor to provide installation and project management services 
we also sell our hif lighting systems on a wholesale basis  principally to electrical contractors and value added resellers to sell to their own customer bases 
we have sold and installed more than  of our hif lighting systems in over  facilities from december  through march  our top direct customers by revenue in fiscal included coca cola enterprises inc  us foodservice  sysco corp  ball corporation  millercoors and pepsico  inc and its affiliates 
our fiscal year ends on march we call our fiscal years which ended on march   and  fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our fiscal first quarter ends on june  our fiscal second quarter ends on september  our fiscal third quarter ends on december and our fiscal fourth quarter ends on march because of the recessed state of the global economy  especially as it impacted capital equipment manufacturers  our results for the first half of fiscal continued to be impacted by lengthened customer sales cycles and sluggish customer capital spending 
during the second half of fiscal  capital equipment purchases were slightly improved and we continue to remain optimistic regarding customer behaviors heading into fiscal year to address these difficult economic conditions  we implemented million of annualized cost reductions during the first quarter of fiscal these cost containment initiatives included reductions related to headcount  work hours and discretionary spending and began to show results in the second half of fiscal and the first half of fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  we identified an additional million of annualized cost reductions related to decreased product costs  improved manufacturing efficiencies and reduced operating expenses 
we realized these cost reductions beginning during the fiscal third quarter through reduction in general and administrative expenses and improved product margins for our hif lighting systems 
despite these recent economic challenges  we remain optimistic about our near term and long term financial performance 
our near term optimism is based upon our record level of revenue in fiscal along with our return to profitability  the increasing volume of unit sales in the back half of fiscal of our new products  specifically our exterior hif fixtures  intelite wireless dynamic controls  and our apollo light pipes  the increase in the number of our value added resellers and their sales staffs and our cost reduction plans completed during fiscal our long term optimism is based upon the considerable size of the existing market opportunity for lighting retrofits  the continued development of our new products and product enhancements  the opportunity for additional revenue from sales of renewable technologies through our orion engineered systems division  the opportunity for our participation in the replacement part aftermarket and the increasing national recognition of the importance of environmental stewardship  including legislation within the state of wisconsin passed earlier this fiscal year that recognized our solar apollo light pipe as a renewable product offering and qualified it for incentives currently offered to other renewable technologies 
in august  we created orion engineered systems  a new operating division which has been offering our customers additional alternative renewable energy systems 
in fiscal  we sold and installed three solar photovoltaic  or pv  electricity generating projects  completing our test analysis on two of the three in the fiscal third quarter  and executed our first cash sale and our first power purchase agreement  or ppa  as a result of the successful testing of these systems 
we completed the installation and customer acceptance of the third system  a cash sale  during our fiscal first quarter 
during our fiscal second quarter  we received an million cash order for a solar pv generating system for which we recognized million of revenue in fiscal 
table of contents additionally  orion engineered systems is responsible for our project management activities and related service revenues for both hif lighting and renewable technology projects 
during our fiscal third quarter  revenue from our orion engineered systems group exceeded the quantitative threshold for gaap segment accounting 
we now report our energy management and engineered systems groups as separate segments 
our energy management division develops  manufactures and sells commercial high intensity fluorescent  or hif  lighting systems and energy management systems 
our engineered systems division sells and integrates alternative renewable energy systems and provides technical services for the company s sale of hif lighting systems and energy management systems 
in response to the constraints on our customers capital spending budgets  we have more aggressively promoted the advantages to our customers of purchasing our energy management systems through our orion throughput agreement  or ota  financing program 
our ota financing program provides for our customer s purchase of our energy management systems without an up front capital outlay 
the ota is structured as a supply agreement in which we receive monthly rental payments over the life of the contract  typically months  with an annual renewable agreement with a maximum term between two and five years 
we expect that the number of customers who choose to purchase our systems by using our ota financing program will continue to increase in future periods 
additionally  we have provided a financing program to our alternative renewable energy system customers called a solar ppa as an alternative to purchasing our systems for cash 
the ppa is a supply side agreement for the generation of electricity and subsequent sale to the end user 
we do not intend to use our own cash balances to fund future ppa opportunities and are looking to secure external sources of funding for ppa s on behalf of our customers 
revenue and expense components revenue 
we sell our energy management products and services directly to commercial and industrial customers  and indirectly to end users through our partner network and through wholesale sales to electrical contractors and value added resellers 
we currently generate the substantial majority of our revenue from sales of hif lighting systems and related services to commercial and industrial customers 
while our services include comprehensive site assessment  site field verification  utility incentive and government subsidy management  engineering design  project management  installation and recycling in connection with our retrofit installations  we separately recognize service revenue only for our installation and recycling services 
our service revenues are recognized when services are complete and customer acceptance has been received 
in fiscal and fiscal  we increased our efforts to expand our value added reseller channels  including through developing a partner standard operating procedural kit  providing our partners with product marketing materials and providing training to channel partners on our sales methodologies 
these wholesale channels accounted for approximately of our total revenue volume in fiscal and increased to of total revenue contributed in fiscal  not taking into consideration our renewable technologies revenue generated through our orion engineered systems division 
additionally  we offer our ota sales type financing program under which we finance the customer s purchase of our energy management systems 
the ota program was established to assist customers who are interested in purchasing our energy management systems but who have capital expenditure budget limitations 
our ota contracts are capital leases under gaap and we record revenue at the present value of the future payments at the time customer acceptance of the installed and operating system is complete 
our ota contracts under this sales type financing are either structured with a fixed term  typically months  and a bargain purchase option at the end of term  or are one year in duration and  at the completion of the initial one year term  provide for i one to four automatic one year renewals at agreed upon pricing  ii an early buyout for cash  or iii the return of the equipment at the customer s expense 
the revenue that we are entitled to receive from the sale of our lighting fixtures under our ota financing program is fixed and is based on the cost of the lighting fixtures and applicable profit margin 
our revenue from agreements entered into under this program is not dependent upon our customers actual energy savings 
upon completion of the installation  we may choose to sell the future cash flows and residual rights to the equipment on a non recourse basis to an unrelated third party finance company in exchange for cash and future payments 
we recognize revenue from ota contracts at the net present value of the future cash flows at the completion date of the installation of the energy management systems and the customers acknowledgement that they system is operating as specified 

table of contents in fiscal  we recognized million of revenue from completed ota contracts 
in fiscal  we recognized million of revenue from completed ota contracts 
in the future  we expect an increase in the volume of otas as our customers take advantage of our value proposition without incurring any up front capital cost 
our ppa financing program provides for our customer s purchase of electricity from our renewable energy generating assets without an upfront capital outlay 
our ppa is a longer term contract  typically in excess of years  in which we receive monthly payments over the life of the contract 
this program creates an ongoing recurring revenue stream  but reduces near term revenue as the payments are recognized as revenue on a monthly basis over the life of the contract versus upfront upon product shipment or project completion 
in fiscal  we did not recognize any revenue from completed ppas 
in fiscal  we recognized million of revenue from completed ppas 
as of march   we had signed one customer to two separate ppas representing future potential discounted revenue streams of million 
we discount the future revenue from ppas due to the long term nature of the contracts  typically in excess of years 
the timing of expected future discounted gaap revenue recognition and the resulting operating cash inflows from ppas  assuming the systems perform as designed  was as follows as of march  in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal beyond total expected future discounted revenue from ppas other than for ota and ppa revenue  we recognize revenue on product only sales at the time of shipment 
for projects consisting of multiple elements of revenue  such as a combination of product sales and services  we recognize revenue by allocating the total contract revenue to each element based on their relative selling prices 
we determine the selling price of products based upon the price charged when these products are sold separately 
for services  we determine the selling price based upon management s best estimate giving consideration to pricing practices  margin objectives  competition  scope and size of individual projects  geographies in which we offer our products and services and internal costs 
we recognize revenue at the time of product shipment on product sales and on services completed prior to product shipment 
we recognize revenue associated with services provided after product shipment  based on their relative selling price  when the services are completed and customer acceptance has been received 
when other significant obligations or acceptance terms remain after products are delivered  revenue is recognized only after such obligations are fulfilled or acceptance by the customer has occurred 
our dependence on individual key customers can vary from period to period as a result of the significant size of some of our retrofit and multi facility roll out projects 
our top customers accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal no customer accounted for more than of our total revenue in any of fiscal  or to the extent that large retrofit and roll out projects become a greater component of our total revenue  we may experience more customer concentration in given periods 
the loss of  or substantial reduction in sales volume to  any of our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our total revenue in any given period and may result in significant annual and quarterly revenue variations 
our level of total revenue for any given period is dependent upon a number of factors  including i the demand for our products and systems  including our ota and ppa programs and any new products  applications and service that we may introduce through our orion engineered systems division  ii the number and timing of large retrofit and multi facility retrofit  or roll out  projects  iii the level of our wholesale sales  iv our ability to realize revenue from our services  v market conditions  vi our execution of our sales process  vii our ability to compete in a highly competitive market and our ability to respond successfully to market competition  viii the selling price of our products and services  ix changes in capital investment levels by our customers and prospects  and 
table of contents x customer sales and budget cycles 
as a result  our total revenue may be subject to quarterly variations and our total revenue for any particular fiscal quarter may not be indicative of future results 
contracted revenue 
although contracted revenue is not a term recognized under gaap  since the volume of our ota and ppa business is expected to continue to increase and because our ota revenues are not recognized until project completion occurs and due to the long term operating lease treatment of our ppa projects  we believe contracted revenue provides our management and investors with an informative measure of our relative order activity for any particular period 
we define contracted revenue as the total contractual value of all firm purchase orders received for our products and services and the expected future potential gross revenue streams  including all renewal periods  for all otas upon the execution of the contract and the discounted value of future potential revenue from energy generation over the life of all ppas along with the discounted value of revenue for renewable energy credits  or recs  for as long as the rec programs are currently defined to be in existence with the governing body 
for cash contracted revenue  we generally expect that we will begin to recognize gaap revenue within days from receipt of purchase order 
for ota contracted revenue  we generally expect that we will begin to recognize gaap revenue under the terms of the agreements within days from the firm contract date 
for ppa contracted revenue  we generally expect that we will begin to recognize gaap revenue under the terms of the ppas within days from the firm contract date 
we believe that total contracted revenues are a key financial metric for evaluating and measuring our performance because the measure is an indicator of our success in our customers adoption and acceptance of our energy products and services as it measures firm contracted revenue value  regardless of the contract s cash or deferred financial structure and the related different gaap revenue recognition treatment 
in fiscal  total contracted revenue was million  including million of expected gross cash flow streams associated with otas 
in fiscal  total contracted revenue was million  which included million of expected potential gross cash flow streams associated with otas and million of potential discounted revenue streams from ppas 
in fiscal  total contracted revenue was million  an increase of compared to fiscal  which included million of expected potential gross cash flow streams associated with otas and million of potential discounted revenue streams from ppas 
a reconciliation of our contracted revenues to our gaap revenues is as follows fiscal year ended fiscal year ended march  march  as restated total contracted revenues change in cash order backlog change in ota backlog contracted revenue from ppas ppa gaap revenue recognized other miscellaneous revenue gaap basis change in backlog reflects the increase or decrease in cash orders at the end of the respective period where product delivery or service performance has not yet occurred 
gaap revenue will be recognized when the performance conditions have been satisfied  typically within days from the end of the period 
change in ota backlog reflects the increase or decrease in ota contracts at the end of the respective period where the project was in implementation 
gaap revenue will be recognized at the net present value of future cash flows upon completion of the installation and the customer acceptance of the technology 
contracted revenue from ppas is subtracted to reconcile the gaap revenue as recognition of gaap revenue will occur in future periods 
other miscellaneous includes a reduction from ota contracted revenues measured at gross future cash flows and gaap revenue measured at the net present value of future cash flows for completed ota projects 
backlog 
we define backlog as the total contractual value of all firm orders received for our lighting products and services where delivery of product or completion of services has not yet occurred as of the end of any particular 
table of contents reporting period 
such orders must be evidenced by a signed proposal acceptance or purchase order from the customer 
our backlog does not include otas  ppas or national contracts that have been negotiated  but under which we have not yet received a purchase order for the specific location 
as of march   we had a backlog of firm purchase orders of approximately million 
as of march   we had a backlog of firm purchase orders of approximately million  which included million of solar pv orders 
we generally expect this level of firm purchase order backlog related to hif lighting systems to be converted into revenue within the following quarter and our firm purchase order backlog related to solar pv systems to be recognized within the following two quarters 
principally as a result of the continued lengthening of our customer s purchasing decisions because of current recessed economic conditions and related factors  the continued shortening of our installation cycles and the number of projects sold through national and otas  a comparison of backlog from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of actual revenue recognized in future periods 
cost of revenue 
our total cost of revenue consists of costs for i raw materials  including sheet  coiled and specialty reflective aluminum  ii electrical components  including ballasts  power supplies and lamps  iii wages and related personnel expenses  including stock based compensation charges  for our fabricating  coating  assembly  logistics and project installation service organizations  iv manufacturing facilities  including depreciation on our manufacturing facilities and equipment  taxes  insurance and utilities  v warranty expenses  vi installation and integration  and vii shipping and handling 
our cost of aluminum can be subject to commodity price fluctuations  which we attempt to mitigate with forward fixed price  minimum quantity purchase commitments with our suppliers 
we also purchase many of our electrical components through forward purchase contracts 
we buy most of our specialty reflective aluminum from a single supplier  and most of our ballast and lamp components from a single supplier  although we believe we could obtain sufficient quantities of these raw materials and components on a price and quality competitive basis from other suppliers if necessary 
purchases from our current primary supplier of ballast and lamp components constituted  and of our total cost of revenue in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal our cost of revenue from ota projects is recorded upon customer acceptance and acknowledgement that the system is operating as specified 
our production labor force is non union and  as a result  our production labor costs have been relatively stable 
we have been expanding our network of qualified third party installers to realize efficiencies in the installation process 
during fiscal and fiscal  we reduced headcounts and improved production product flow through reengineering of our assembly stations 
gross margin 
our gross profit has been  and will continue to be  affected by the relative levels of our total revenue and our total cost of revenue  and as a result  our gross profit may be subject to quarterly variation 
our gross profit as a percentage of total revenue  or gross margin  is affected by a number of factors  including i our level of solar pv sales which generally have substantially lower relative gross margins than our traditional energy management systems  ii our mix of large retrofit and multi facility roll out projects with national accounts  iii the level of our wholesale and partner sales which generally have historically resulted in lower relative gross margins  but higher relative net margins  than our sales to direct customers  iv our realization rate on our billable services  v our project pricing  vi our level of warranty claims  vii our level of utilization of our manufacturing facilities and production equipment and related absorption of our manufacturing overhead costs  viii our level of efficiencies in our manufacturing operations  and ix our level of efficiencies from our subcontracted installation service providers 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses consist of i general and administrative expenses  ii sales and marketing expenses  and iii research and development expenses 
personnel related costs are our largest operating expense 
in fiscal  we intend to increase headcount in our sales areas for telemarketing and direct sales employees as we believe that future opportunities within our business remain strong 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs for i salaries and related personnel expenses  including stock based compensation charges related to our executive  finance  human resource  information technology and operations organizations  ii public company costs  including investor relations  external audit and internal audit  iii occupancy expenses  iv professional services fees  v technology related costs and amortization  vi bad debt and asset impairment charges  and vii corporate related travel 
our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs for i salaries and related personnel expenses  including stock based compensation charges related to our sales and marketing organization  ii internal and 
table of contents external sales commissions and bonuses  iii travel  lodging and other out of pocket expenses associated with our selling efforts  iv marketing programs  v pre sales costs  and vi other related overhead 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs for i salaries and related personnel expenses  including stock based compensation charges  related to our engineering organization  ii payments to consultants  iii the design and development of new energy management products and enhancements to our existing energy management system  iv quality assurance and testing  and v other related overhead 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
in fiscal  our operating expenses increased as a result of the completion of our new technology center and the related building occupancy costs 
during fiscal  we invested in marketing efforts to our direct end customers and to our channel partners through increasing advertising  marketing collateral materials and participating in national industry and customer trade shows 
we expense all pre sale costs incurred in connection with our sales process prior to obtaining a purchase order 
these pre sale costs may reduce our net income in a given period prior to recognizing any corresponding revenue 
we also intend to continue investing in our research and development of new and enhanced energy management products and services 
we recognize compensation expense for the fair value of our stock option awards granted over their related vesting period 
we recognized million  million and million of stock based compensation expense in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal as a result of prior option grants  including option grants in fiscal  we expect to recognize an additional million of stock based compensation over a weighted average period of approximately seven years 
these charges have been  and will continue to be  allocated to cost of product revenue  general and administrative expenses  sales and marketing expenses and research and development expenses based on the departments in which the personnel receiving such awards have primary responsibility 
a substantial majority of these charges have been  and likely will continue to be  allocated to general and administrative expenses and sales and marketing expenses 
interest expense 
our interest expense is comprised primarily of interest expense on outstanding borrowings under long term debt obligations described under liquidity and capital resources indebtedness below  including the amortization of previously incurred financing costs 
we amortize deferred financing costs to interest expense over the life of the related debt instrument  ranging from two to fifteen years 
loss on sale of receivable 
our loss on sale of receivables consists of losses associated with sales of receivables from ota contracts to a third party and the discounted value of the long term payments associated with such sale 
dividend and interest income 
our dividend income consisted of dividends paid on preferred shares that we acquired in july the terms of these preferred shares provided for annual dividend payments to us of million 
we sold the preferred shares back to the issuer in june and all dividends accrued were paid upon sale 
we also report interest income earned from our financed ota contracts and on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
for fiscal  our interest income increased as a result of our investment of the net proceeds from our initial public offering in short term  interest bearing  money market funds  bank certificate of deposits and investment grade securities 
for fiscal and fiscal  our interest income increased as a result of the increasing ota finance contracts completed and the related interest charged to customers 
income taxes 
as of march   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal tax purposes and million for state tax purposes 
included in these loss carryforwards were million for federal and million for state tax purposes of compensation expenses that were associated with the exercise of nonqualified stock options 
the benefit from our net operating losses created from these compensation expenses has not yet been recognized in our financial statements and will be accounted for in our shareholders equity as a credit to additional paid in capital as the deduction reduces our income taxes payable 
we also had federal tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and state tax credits of million 
a valuation allowance has been set up for the state tax credits due to our state apportioned income and the potential expiration of the state tax credits due to the carry forward period 
these federal and state net operating losses and credit carryforwards are available  subject to the discussion in the following paragraph  to offset future taxable income and  if not utilized  will begin to expire in varying amounts between 
table of contents generally  a change of more than in the ownership of a company s stock  by value  over a three year period constitutes an ownership change for federal income tax purposes 
an ownership change may limit a company s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards attributable to the period prior to such change 
in fiscal and prior to our ipo  past issuances and transfers of stock caused an ownership change for certain tax purposes 
when certain ownership changes occur  tax laws require that a calculation be made to establish a limitation on the use of net operating loss carryforwards created in periods prior to such ownership change 
there was no limitation that occurred for fiscal or fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth the line items of our consolidated statements of operations on an absolute dollar basis and as a relative percentage of our total revenue for each applicable period  together with the relative percentage change in such line item between applicable comparable periods set forth below fiscal year ended march  of of of amount revenue amount revenue change amount revenue change as restated dollars in thousands product revenue service revenue total revenue cost of product revenue cost of service revenue total cost of revenue gross profit general and administrative expenses sales and marketing expenses research and development expenses income loss from operations  nm  interest expense loss on sale of receivable nm  extinguishment of debt dividend and interest income income loss before income tax income tax expense benefit net income loss nm not meaningful for fiscal  represents the impact of an accounting change from operating lease treatment to sales type capital lease treatment for our ota finance contracts 
see note b restatement of financial statements to our consolidated financial statements for detailed information regarding the impact of the restatement on fiscal consolidated fiscal compared to fiscal contracted revenue 
total contracted revenue increased from million for fiscal which included million of future gross cash flow streams associated with otas and million of future potential revenue streams associated with ppas to million for fiscal which included million of future gross cash flow streams associated with otas and million of future potential revenue streams associated with ppas  an increase of million  or 
we attribute this improvement in contracted revenue to an increase in orders for renewable technologies through our orion engineered systems division and an increase in new customer ota contracts  along with increased order activity for our integrated lighting systems from an improved economic environment during the second half of fiscal 
table of contents revenue 
product revenue increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase in product revenue was due to million of revenue from cash sales of renewable energy photovoltaic systems  or pv  and increased revenue from the sale of energy goods and management systems through cash sales and ota contracts 
service revenue decreased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in service revenue was a result of the continued percentage increase of total revenue to our wholesale channels where services are not provided 
we believe that the increase in our ota revenues  million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  has helped to address our customers capital spending constraints by providing an alternative to the up front capital requirements of a cash purchase 
accordingly  we believe that our ota financed business will continue to increase during fiscal  accounting for approximately to of our anticipated total revenue 
cost of revenue and gross margin 
product cost of product revenue increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
cost of service revenue decreased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
total gross margins declined to for fiscal from for fiscal the decrease in total gross margin in fiscal was due to the higher mix of renewables revenue with gross margins of 
gross margins from the sale of our hif energy management systems were for fiscal the negative impact from the product mix shift was partially offset by cost containment efforts through the reduction of direct and indirect headcounts  improved production efficiencies resulting from the reengineering of our assembly process  negotiated price decreases on raw materials and reductions in discretionary spending 
operating expenses general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses decreased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease was a result of million in reduced compensation costs resulting from headcount reductions and reduced severance payments  a million reduction in bad debt expense from the prior year  a million decrease in legal expenses  a million decrease in consulting and auditing services and million in discretionary spending reductions 
sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase was a result million in increased travel costs for customer site visits  a million increase in compensation costs related to headcount additions during the year  a million in business development expenses related to our efforts to expand our partner channels  a million increase for advertising and marketing expenses and million for additional technology costs 
research and development 
our research and development expenses increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase in expense for fiscal was due to increased spending on the development of new product offerings  including our new exterior lighting and our led product initiatives 
we also incurred expenses improving our existing energy management control solutions  including our recent improvements to our dynamic control devices 
interest expense 
our interest expense increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase in interest expense for fiscal was due to additional debt funding completed during fiscal for the purpose of financing our ota projects 
for fiscal and fiscal  we capitalized  and of interest for construction in progress  respectively 
loss on sale of receivables 
our loss from the sale of receivables from our ota contracts increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
dividend and interest income 
our interest income decreased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
interest income earned from customer financed programs was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal interest income related to investments in fiscal decreased by million as a result of less cash invested and a decrease in interest rates on our short term investments 

table of contents income taxes 
our income tax benefit decreased from a benefit of million for fiscal year to a benefit of million for fiscal our effective income tax rate for the fiscal year was a benefit rate of  compared to a benefit rate of for the fiscal year during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we converted almost all of our existing incentive stock options  or isos  to non qualified stock options  or nqsos 
this conversion was applied retrospectively allowing us to benefit from million of income tax expense related to non deductible iso stock compensation expense that was previously deferred for income tax purposes 
the conversion reduced our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year to a benefit rate of from a pre conversion income tax expense rate of 
the conversion of isos to nqsos will greatly reduce the effective tax rate volatility that we have historically experienced at nominal pre tax earnings levels 
the change in tax rate versus the prior fiscal year is due to the difference between taxable losses during fiscal and the related impact of the non deductible stock compensation expense and taxable income during fiscal  along with the impact of federal credits available to us 
fiscal compared to fiscal contracted revenue 
total contracted revenue increased from million  which included million of future gross cash flow streams associated with ota contracts  for fiscal to million  which included million of future gross cash flow streams associated with ota contracts and million of discounted revenue streams from ppa contracts  for fiscal  an increase of million or 
revenue 
product revenue decreased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  a decrease of million or 
the decrease was a result of decreased sales of our hif lighting systems 
service revenue decreased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in service revenue was a result of the decreased sales of our hif lighting systems and the continued percentage increase of total revenues to our wholesale channels where services are not provided 
our fiscal revenues continued to be impacted by a general conservatism in the marketplace concerning capital spending and purchase decisions due to continuing adverse economic and credit market conditions 
in the second half of fiscal  we realized a slight improvement in our order volumes in relation to the first half of our fiscal cost of revenue and gross margin 
our cost of product revenue decreased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
our cost of service revenue decreased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
total gross margin increased from for fiscal to for fiscal during fiscal  we maintained improvements in our product gross margins  in spite of the volume decline  resulting from our efforts to reengineer our assembly processes  including the implementation of cell manufacturing stations  a reduction in headcount and a reduction in work hours  and reductions in discretionary spending and premium costs  like overtime 
operating expenses general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million or 
the increase was a result of i million increase for occupancy costs related to the completion of our new technology center  including approximately million for one time start up charges  ii million for legal costs related to the defense and preliminary settlement of our securities class action litigation  iii million in severance compensation costs and headcount additions related to staff support in information technology and executive support staff in human resources and administrative functions  iv million in costs related to the write down of a long term note receivable and bad debt charges on aged accounts receivable  and v million as a result of a one time gain on asset disposal in the fiscal that did not recur in fiscal these cost increases were partially offset by million in decreased compensation costs resulting from headcount reductions and other discretionary spending reductions 
sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase was a result of compensation and benefit costs for additional sales and marketing personnel 
we increased our sales and marketing headcount to

research and development 
our research and development expenses were substantially unchanged in fiscal from fiscal  at approximately million 
expenses incurred in fiscal related to compensation costs for the development and support of new products  depreciation expenses for lab and research equipment and testing costs related to our new wireless controls  exterior lighting and led product initiatives 
interest expense 
our interest expense increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase in interest expense was due to the elimination of capitalized interest resulting from the completion of our corporate technology center 
for fiscal and fiscal  we capitalized  and  of interest for construction in progress  respectively 
loss on sale of receivables 
our loss from the sale of receivables from our ota contracts increased from for fiscal to million for fiscal extinguishment of debt 
in fiscal   of debt under equipment loans from our local government was forgiven related to our creation and retention of certain types and numbers of jobs at our manufacturing facility 
dividend and interest income 
our dividend and interest income decreased from fiscal to fiscal as a result of declining market interest rates and the reduction in our cash balances year over year due to cash used to finance our ota program and our investment in wireless control inventory components 
income taxes 
our income tax expense decreased in fiscal from fiscal due to the reduction in our taxable income 
our effective income tax rate for fiscal was compared to a benefit rate of for fiscal the change in our effective rate was due to a reduction of benefits for non deductible stock compensation expense from prior iso grants and the impact of an increase in our state valuation allowance reserve 
energy management segment the following table summarizes the energy management segment operating results for the year ended march  dollars in thousands revenues operating income operating margin energy management segment revenue increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase was due to increased sales of our hif lighting systems to our national account and wholesale customers  increased revenue from a greater number of ota contracts completed and increased revenue from new product offerings  including exterior lighting  dynamic wireless controls and led fixtures 
energy management segment operating income increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or the increase in operating income for fiscal was a result of the increased revenue and improved gross margins on hif lighting product sales due to cost reduction efforts to reduce manufacturing labor costs and plant reengineering of our manufacturing processes to improve production efficiencies 

table of contents engineered systems segment the following table summarizes the engineered systems segment operating results for the year ended march  dollars in thousands revenues operating loss income operating margin engineered systems segment revenue increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase was due to an increase in the number of and the relative size of the renewable pv systems sold during fiscal versus the prior year 
during the first half of fiscal  our engineered systems segment efforts were primarily focused on research of renewable technology products and understanding if there was a market for these technologies within our customer base 
engineered systems segment operating income increased from a million loss for fiscal to million of operating income for fiscal  an increase of million  an increase of 
the increase in operating income for fiscal was a result of the increased revenue volume and resulting contribution margin from sales of solar renewable energy systems 
corporate and other corporate and other operating loss decreased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in operating loss was primarily attributable to a reduction in legal expenses incurred 

table of contents quarterly results of operations the following tables present our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the last eight fiscal quarters in the period ended march  i on an absolute dollar basis in thousands and ii as a percentage of total revenue for the applicable fiscal quarter 
you should read the following tables in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this form k 
as described above in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note b restatement of financial statements to our consolidated financial statements  our audited consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended march  have been restated to reflect our change of accounting for our ota contracts from operating lease treatment to sales type capital lease treatment 
in our opinion  the unaudited financial information presented below has been prepared on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements  and includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of our operating results for the fiscal quarters presented 
we have restated each of the quarterly consolidated financial statements for the periods ended june  through december  to reclassify our transactions under our otas as sales type leases instead of as operating leases

table of contents our total revenue can fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on the purchasing decisions of our customers and our overall level of sales activity 
historically  our customers have tended to increase their purchases near the beginning or end of their capital budget cycles  which tend to correspond to the beginning or end of the calendar year 
as a result  we have in the past experienced lower relative total revenue in our fiscal first and second quarters and higher relative total revenue in our fiscal third quarter 
these seasonal fluctuations have been largely offset by our customers decisions to initiate multiple facility roll outs 
we expect that there may be future variations in our quarterly total revenue depending on our level of national account roll out projects and wholesale sales 
our results for any particular fiscal quarter may not be indicative of results for other fiscal quarters or an entire fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources overview on december   we completed our initial public offering  or ipo 
net proceeds to us from our ipo were approximately million in net proceeds net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
we invested the net proceeds from our ipo in money market funds and short term government agency bonds  subsequently using approximately million of the net proceeds for working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes  along with million used to repurchase shares of our common stock into treasury 
we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments as of march  compared to million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments as of march  our cash equivalents are invested in money market accounts and bank certificates of deposits with maturities of less than days and an average yield of 
our short term investment account consists of a bank certificate of deposit in the amount of million with an expiration date of june and a yield of 
during fiscal and fiscal  we funded million and million  respectively  for our investment in company owned equipment under our ppa projects 
we do not expect to use our own cash in the future to fund ppa project opportunities and are investigating financing options with third parties to fund future solar projects 
we expect that our volume of ota financed projects will continue to increase in the future and that the cash required to fund these projects will continue to increase as well 
we also recognize that our ability to increase revenues through these finance programs will continue to deplete our cash resources if we do not secure additional funding sources 
we are exploring potential financing alternatives to support the expected growth of our ota contract volumes 
in february  we reengaged a third party finance company to underwrite and  upon successful completion and customer acceptance  purchase outright certain ota customer contracts 
this financing commitment will allow us to provide immediate capital for completed ota projects 
in fiscal  we completed two separate debt financing transactions with a regional bank to provide funding for a pool of individual ota contracts that we hold the contracts for 
we believe that having multiple funding sources for our internally held ota contracts will greatly reduce the cash strain created by funding these contracts ourselves 
the return to a recessionary state of the global economy could potentially have negative effects on our near term liquidity and capital resources  including slower collections of receivables  delays of existing order deliveries and postponements of incoming orders 
however  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  our anticipated cash flows from operating activities and our borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the next months 
as of march   we were in a strong financial position with million in cash and short term investments 
for that reason  we do not anticipate drawing on our revolving line of credit nor do we expect to use significant amounts of our cash balances for operating activities during fiscal our future working capital requirements thereafter will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue  our rate of ota growth and our ability to obtain funding for our ota contracts  our rate of investment into our financed sales programs  our introduction of new products and services and enhancements to our existing energy management system  the timing and extent of expansions of our sales force and other administrative and production personnel  the timing and extent of advertising and promotional campaigns  and our research and development activities 

table of contents cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flows for our fiscal  fiscal and fiscal fiscal year ended march  as restated in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash flows related to operating activities 
cash used in operating activities primarily consists of net income loss adjusted for certain non cash items including depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation expenses  income taxes and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities 
cash used in operating activities for fiscal was million and consisted of net cash of million used for working capital purposes offset by net income of million and adjusted for non cash expense items of million 
cash used for working capital consisted of an increase of million in accounts receivable due to the increase in revenue and a million increase in inventory for purchases described in the section below titled working capital 
cash provided by working capital included a million increase in accounts payable related to payment terms on inventory purchases during the fiscal fourth quarter 
cash used in operating activities for fiscal was million and consisted of net cash of million used for working capital purposes and a net loss of million  offset by non cash expense items of million 
cash used for working capital purposes consisted of an increase of million in trade receivables and a million increase in inventories resulting from purchases of ballast and wireless component inventories 
we increased our level of inventory for these components due to longer lead times and supply availability concerns for inventory components shipping out of asia 
these amounts were offset by an increase of million in accrued expenses resulting from increases in accrued severance costs  increases in accrued legal expenses and increased deposit payments for ota contracts 
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was million and consisted of net cash of million used for working capital purposes and net income adjusted non cash expenses of million 
the million increase in cash provided from operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to improved collections of our accounts receivable 
cash flows related to investing activities 
cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  we invested a net million in equipment related to our ppa finance programs  million for capital improvements related to our information technology systems  renewable technologies  manufacturing and tooling improvements and facility investments and million for patent investments 
in fiscal  we invested million in capital expenditures related to the completion of our new corporate technology center  operating and customer relationship software systems  a photovoltaic solar generated power system and for purchases of manufacturing equipment and tooling 
additionally  we invested million in equipment related to our ppa finance programs and million for the development of our intellectual property 
we generated cash flow from investing activities of million from the sale of short term investments 
in fiscal  we invested million in capital expenditures in our new corporate technology center  operating software systems  improvements in our manufacturing facility and for purchases of equipment and tooling 
we also invested million in short term certificate of deposits and spent million for the purchase of intellectual property rights from an executive  partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of an investment of million 
cash flows related to financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal this included million in new debt borrowings to fund ota and capital projects  million received from stock option and warrant exercises and million for excess tax benefits from stock based compensation 
cash flows used in financing activities included million for repayment of long term debt and million for costs related to our new credit agreement 

table of contents cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal this included proceeds of million received from stock option and warrant exercises  million for proceeds from long term debt and million for excess tax benefits from stock based compensation 
cash used in financing activities included million for debt principal payments and million used for common share repurchases 
cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal the use of cash was due to million used for common share repurchases and million of debt principal payments  offset by million in proceeds from the exercise of common stock options and warrants and million for the impact of deferred taxes on our stock based compensation 
working capital our net working capital as of march   was million  consisting of million in current assets and million in current liabilities 
our net working capital as of march  was million  consisting of million in current assets and million in current liabilities 
our accounts receivables increased from our prior fiscal year end by million as a result of our increased revenues during the second half of fiscal year  as well as an increase in finance receivables related to ota contracts 
our inventories increased from our fiscal year end by million due to an increase in the level of our wireless control inventories of million based upon our wireless control initiatives and a million increase in ballast component inventories to avoid potential supply disruptions 
the vast majority of our wireless components are assembled overseas and require longer delivery lead times 
in addition  overseas suppliers require deposit payments at time of purchase order 
during fiscal  we continued to increase our inventory levels of key electronic components  specifically electronic ballasts  to avoid potential shortages and customer service issues as a result of lengthening supply lead times and product availability issues 
we continue to monitor supply side concerns within the electronic components market and believe that our current inventory levels are sufficient to protect us against the risk of being unable to deliver product as specified by our customers requirements 
we are continually monitoring supply side concerns through conversations with our key vendors and currently believe that supply availability concerns appear to have moderated  but have not diminished to the point where we anticipate reducing safety stock to the levels that existed prior to the electrical components supply issues 
we also remain concerned that the recent tragic events in japan could lead to additional supply chain disruptions of these important electronic components 
we generally attempt to maintain at least a three month supply of on hand inventory of purchased components and raw materials to meet anticipated demand  as well as to reduce our risk of unexpected raw material or component shortages or supply interruptions 
our accounts receivables  inventory and payables may increase to the extent our revenue and order levels increase 
indebtedness on june   we entered into a new credit agreement  which we refer to herein as the credit agreement  with jp morgan chase bank  na  whom we refer to herein as jp morgan 
the credit agreement replaced our former credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility  which we refer to herein as the credit facility  that matures on june  borrowings under the credit facility are limited to i million or ii during periods in which the outstanding principal balance of outstanding loans under the credit facility is greater than million  the lesser of a million or b the sum of of the outstanding principal balance of certain accounts receivable and of certain inventory 
we also may cause jp morgan to issue letters of credit for our account in the aggregate principal amount of up to million  with the dollar amount of each issued letter of credit counting against the overall limit on borrowings under the credit facility 
as of march   we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million  primarily for securing collateral requirements under equipment operating leases 
we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility as of march  we were in compliance with all of our covenants under the credit agreement as of march  the credit agreement is secured by a first lien security interest in our accounts receivable  inventory and general intangibles  and a second lien priority in our equipment and fixtures 
all otas  ppas  leases  supply 
table of contents agreements and or similar agreements relating to solar photovoltaic and wind turbine systems or facilities  as well as all of our accounts receivable and assets related to the foregoing  are excluded from these liens 
we must pay a fee of on the average daily unused amount of the credit facility and a fee of on the daily average face amount of undrawn issued letters of credit 
the fee on unused amounts is waived if we or our affiliates maintain funds on deposit with jp morgan or its affiliates above a specified amount 
we did not meet the deposit requirement to waive the unused fee as of march  in addition to our credit facility  we also have other existing long term indebtedness and obligations under various debt instruments  including pursuant to a bank term note  a bank first mortgage  a debenture to a community development organization  a federal block grant loan  two city industrial revolving loans and two notes for funding ota contracts 
as of march   the total amount of principal outstanding on these various obligations was million 
these obligations have varying maturity dates between and and bear interest at annual rates of between and 
the weighted average annual interest rate of such obligations as of march  was 
based on interest rates in effect as of march   we expect that our total debt service payments on such obligations for fiscal  including scheduled principal  lease and interest payments  but excluding any repayment of borrowings on the credit facility  will approximate million 
all of these obligations are subject to security interests on our assets 
several of these obligations have covenants  such as customary financial and restrictive covenants  including maintenance of a minimum debt service coverage ratio  a minimum current ratio  quarterly rolling net income requirement  limitations on executive compensation and advances  limits on capital expenditures per year  limits on distributions  and restrictions on our ability to make loans  advances  extensions of credit  investments  capital contributions  incur additional indebtedness  create liens  guaranty obligations  merge or consolidate or undergo a change in control 
as of march   we were in compliance with all such covenants  as amended 
capital spending over the past three fiscal years  we have made capital expenditures primarily for general corporate purposes for our corporate headquarters and technology center  production equipment and tooling and for information technology systems 
our capital expenditures totaled million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we plan to incur approximately to million in capital expenditures in fiscal  excluding capital to support ota contracts 
our capital spending plans predominantly consist of further cost improvements in our manufacturing facility  improvements to our building and headquarters  new product development and investment in information technology systems 
we expect to finance these capital expenditures primarily through our existing cash  equipment secured loans and leases  to the extent needed  or by using our available capacity under our credit facility 
contractual obligations information regarding our known contractual obligations of the types described below as of march  is set forth in the following table payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands bank debt obligations cash interest payments on debt operating lease obligations purchase order and capital expenditure commitments total reflects non cancellable purchase commitments in the amount of million for certain inventory items entered into in order to secure better pricing and ensure materials on hand 

table of contents the table of contractual obligations and commitments does not include our unrecognized tax benefits which were million at march  we have a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of any adjustments to these unrecognized benefits 
furthermore  we believe that any negative impact from future tax audits would result in a minimal cash liability due to our net operating loss carryforwards 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
inflation our results from operations have not been  and we do not expect them to be  materially affected by inflation 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and our related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we re evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  the collectability of receivables  stock based compensation  warranty reserves and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
a summary of our critical accounting policies is set forth below 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when the following criteria have been met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred and title has passed to the customer  the sales price is fixed and determinable and no further obligation exists  and collectability is reasonably assured 
the majority of our revenue is recognized when products are shipped to a customer or when services are completed and acceptance provisions  if any  have been met 
in certain of our contracts  we provide multiple deliverables 
we record the revenue associated with each element of these arrangements by allocating the total contract revenue to each element based on their relative selling prices 
in such circumstances  we use a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value  if available  third party evidence  or tpe of selling price if vsoe is not available  and best estimate of the selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
we established vsoe of selling price for our hif lighting and energy management system products using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately 
we determine the selling price for installation and recycling services and for solar renewable product and services using management s best estimate of selling price 
we consider external and internal factors including  but not limited to  pricing practices  margin objectives  competition  geographies in which we offer our products and services  internal costs  and the scope and size of projects 
additionally  we offer our ota sales type financing program under which we finance the customer s purchase of our energy management systems 
our ota contracts are sales type capital leases under gaap and we record revenue at the net present value of the future payments at the time customer acceptance of the installed and operating system is complete 
our ota contracts under this sales type financing are either structured with a fixed term  typically months  and a bargain purchase option at the end of term  or are one year in duration and  at the completion of the initial one year term  provide for i one to four automatic one year renewals at agreed upon pricing  ii an early buyout for cash  or iii the return of the equipment at the customer s expense 
the revenue that we are entitled to receive from the sale of our lighting fixtures under our ota financing program is fixed and is based on the cost of the lighting fixtures and applicable profit margin 
our revenue from agreements entered into under this program is not dependent upon our customers actual energy savings 
upon completion of the installation  we may choose to sell the future cash flows and residual rights to the equipment on a non recourse basis to an unrelated third party finance company in exchange for cash and future payments 
deferred revenue or deferred costs are recorded for project sales consisting of multiple elements  where the criteria for revenue recognition have not been met 
the majority of our deferred revenue relates to investment tax grants received for solar asset projects  advance customer billings or to prepaid services to be provided at 
table of contents determined future dates 
as of march  and  our deferred revenue was million and million  respectively 
deferred costs on product are recorded as a current asset as project completions occur within a few months 
as of march  and  our deferred costs were million and million  respectively 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and include raw materials  work in process and finished goods 
items are removed from inventory using the first in  first out method 
work in process inventories are comprised of raw materials that have been converted into components for final assembly 
inventory amounts include the cost to manufacture the item  such as the cost of raw materials and related freight  labor and other applied overhead costs 
we review our inventory for obsolescence and marketability 
if the estimated market value  which is based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions  falls below cost  then the inventory value is reduced to its market value 
our inventory obsolescence reserves at march  and were million and million 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing evaluations of our customers and continuously monitor collections and payments and estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the aging of the underlying receivables  our historical experience with write offs and specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations  and we believe appropriate reserves have been established  we may not adequately predict future credit losses 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate and result in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required which would result in additional general and administrative expense in the period such determination is made 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at march  and march  investments 
our accounting and disclosures for short term investments are in accordance with the requirements of the fair value measurements and disclosure  financial instrument  and investments debt and security topics of the fasb accounting standards codification 
the fair value measurements and disclosure topic defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
gaap describes a fair value hierarchy based on the following three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
as of march  and  our financial assets were measured at fair value employing level inputs 
stock based compensation 
we have historically issued stock options to our employees  executive officers and directors 
we adopted the provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation  which requires us to expense the estimated fair value of employee stock options and similar awards based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant 
compensation costs for options granted are recognized in earnings  net of estimated forfeitures  on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 

table of contents the fair value of each option for financial reporting purposes was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions used for grants fiscal year ended march  weighted average expected term years years years risk free interest rate expected volatility expected forfeiture rate the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain assumptions  including fair value  expected term  risk free interest rate  expected volatility  expected dividends  and expected forfeiture rate to calculate the fair value of stock based payment awards 
we estimated the expected term of our stock options based on the vesting term of our options and expected exercise behavior 
our risk free interest rate was based on the implied yield available on united states treasury zero coupon issues as of the option grant date with a remaining term approximately equal to the expected life of the option 
for fiscal and fiscal  we determined volatility based on an analysis of a peer group of public companies due to a limited history of trading of our common stock 
for fiscal  we determined volatility based upon the volatility of our common share price as we determined that we now had sufficient information regarding the trading volatility of our common stock 
as required by our stock and incentive awards plan  since the closing of our ipo in december  we have solely used the closing sale price of our common shares on the nyse amex or the nasdaq global market on the date of grant to establish the exercise price of our stock options 
we recognized stock based compensation expense under asc of million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal as of march   million of total stock option compensation cost was expected to be recognized by us over a weighted average period of years 
we expect to recognize million of stock based compensation expense in fiscal based on our stock options outstanding as of march  this expense will increase further to the extent we have granted  or will grant  additional stock options in the future 
common stock warrants 
as of march   warrants were outstanding to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock at weighted average exercise prices of per share 
these warrants were valued using a black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions i contractual terms of five years  ii weighted average risk free interest rates of to  iii expected volatility ranging between and  and iv dividend yields of 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to determine our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expenses  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must reflect this increase as an expense within the tax provision in our statements of operations 
our judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we continue to monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly 
for fiscal  we determined that a valuation allowance against our net state deferred tax assets was necessary in the amount of  due to our state apportioned income and the potential expiration of state tax credits due to the carryforward periods 
in making 
table of contents this determination  we considered all available positive and negative evidence  including projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  recent financial performance and ownership changes 
we believe that past issuances and transfers of our stock caused an ownership change in fiscal that affected the timing of the use of our net operating loss carryforwards  but we do not believe the ownership change affects the use of the full amount of the net operating loss carryforwards 
as a result  our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards attributable to the period prior to such ownership change to offset taxable income will be subject to limitations in a particular year  which could potentially result in increased future tax liability for us 
as of march   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal tax purposes and million for state tax purposes 
included in these loss carryforwards were million for federal and million for state tax expenses that were associated with the exercise of non qualified stock options 
the benefit from our net operating losses created from these compensation expenses has not yet been recognized in our financial statements and will be accounted for in our shareholders equity as a credit to additional paid in capital as the deduction reduces our income taxes payable 
we first recognize tax benefits from current period stock option expenses against current period income 
the remaining current period income is offset by net operating losses under the tax law ordering approach 
under this approach  we will utilize the net operating losses from stock option expenses last 
we also had federal tax credit carryforwards of million and state tax credit carryforwards of  which is net of a  valuation allowance 
both the net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in varying amounts between and we recognize penalties and interest related to uncertain tax liabilities in income tax expense 
penalties and interest were immaterial as of the date of adoption and are included in unrecognized tax benefits 
due to the existence of net operating loss and credit carryforwards  all years since are open to examination by tax authorities 
by their nature  tax laws are often subject to interpretation 
further complicating matters is that in those cases where a tax position is open to interpretation  differences of opinion can result in differing conclusions as to the amount of tax benefits to be recognized under financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  income taxes 
asc utilizes a two step approach for evaluating tax positions 
recognition step occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
measurement step is only addressed if step has been satisfied 
under step  the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit  determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
consequently  the level of evidence and documentation necessary to support a position prior to being given recognition and measurement within the financial statements is a matter of judgment that depends on all available evidence 
as of march   the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits was approximately million  all of which would reduce our effective tax rate if recognized 
we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable  however  actual results could differ  which could result in gains or losses that could be material 
recent accounting pronouncements see note c summary of significant accounting policies to our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoption and expected effects on results of operations and financial condition 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the risk of loss related to changes in market prices  including interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity pricing that may adversely impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
inflation 
our results from operations have not historically been  and we do not expect them to be  materially affected by inflation 
foreign exchange risk 
we face minimal exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our foreign currency losses for all reporting periods have been nominal 

table of contents interest rate risk 
our investments consist primarily of investments in money market funds and certificate of deposits 
while the instruments we hold are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we do not believe that we are subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
it is our policy not to enter into interest rate derivative financial instruments 
as a result  we do not currently have any significant interest rate exposure 
as of march   million of our million of outstanding debt was at floating interest rates 
an increase of in the prime rate would result in an increase in our interest expense of approximately  per year 
commodity price risk 
we are exposed to certain commodity price risks associated with our purchases of raw materials  most significantly our aluminum purchases 
we attempt to mitigate commodity price fluctuation for our aluminum through to month forward fixed price purchase orders and minimum quantity purchase commitments with suppliers 
we have currently locked pricing for our aluminum requirements through the first half of fiscal additionally  we recycle legacy hid fixtures and recover the salvaged scrap value which we believe provides a raw materials cost hedge as commodity prices change 
credit risk 
credit risk refers to the potential for economic loss arising from the failure of our customers to meet their contractual agreements 
our financing program  the orion throughput agreements  or ota  is an installment based payment plan for our customers 
this financing program subjects us to credit risk as poor credit decisions or customer defaults could result in increases to our allowances for doubtful accounts and or write offs of accounts receivable and could have material adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition 
these agreements and their increased use will require us to make significant investments of capital  whether we finance them internally or raise additional debt financing and or equity capital to support the expansion 
our ability to accurately measure and manage credit risk will be integral to the profitability of our business and our capital adequacy
