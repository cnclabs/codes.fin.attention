table of contents overview we are a multi national pharmaceutical and diagnostics company that seeks to establish industry leading positions in large and rapidly growing medical markets by leveraging our discovery  development and commercialization expertise and our novel and proprietary technologies 
our current focus is on conditions with major unmet medical needs including neurological disorders  infectious diseases  oncology and ophthalmologic diseases 
we are developing a range of solutions to diagnose  treat and prevent these conditions  including molecular diagnostics tests  proprietary pharmaceuticals and vaccines 
we plan to commercialize these solutions on a global basis in large and high growth markets  including emerging markets 
we have already established emerging markets pharmaceutical platforms in chile and mexico  which are delivering revenue and which we expect to deliver cash flow and facilitate future market entry for our products currently in development 
we also actively explore opportunities to acquire complementary pharmaceuticals  compounds  technologies  and businesses 
we expect to incur substantial losses as we continue the development of our product candidates  continue our other research and development activities  and establish a sales and marketing infrastructure in anticipation of the commercialization of our diagnostic and pharmaceutical product candidates 
we currently have limited commercialization capabilities  and it is possible that we may never successfully commercialize any of our diagnostic and pharmaceutical product candidates 
we do not currently generate revenue from any of our diagnostic and pharmaceutical product candidates 
our research and development activities are budgeted to expand over a period of time and will require further resources if we are to be successful 
as a result  we believe that our operating losses are likely to be substantial over the next several years 
we may need to obtain additional funds to further develop our research and development programs  and there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to us when needed on acceptable terms  or at all

since our inception  we have not generated sufficient gross margins to offset our operating and other expenses and our primary source of cash has been from the private placement of stock and credit facilities available to us 
on march   we issued  shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering at a price of per share 
the net proceeds received in connection with the offering were approximately million after deducting the underwriters discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses 
we also granted the underwriters a day option to purchase up to an additional  shares of our common stock to cover overallotments  if any 
on january   we acquired all of the outstanding stock of curna  inc curna  a privately held therapeutics company  in exchange for million in cash 
curna is engaged in the discovery of new drugs for the treatment of a wide variety of illnesses  including cancer  heart disease  metabolic disorders and a range of genetic anomalies

we are obligated to pay interest upon maturity  capitalized quarterly  on outstanding borrowings under the line of credit at an annual rate  which is due march  the line of credit is collateralized by all of our us based personal property except our intellectual property 
we expect to incur losses from operations for the foreseeable future 
we expect to incur substantial research and development expenses  including expenses related to the hiring of personnel and additional clinical trials 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will also increase as we expand our sales  marketing and administrative staff and add infrastructure 
we believe the cash and cash equivalents on hand at december   the amounts available to be borrowed under our lines of credit  and proceeds from the issuance of our common stock in an underwritten public offering on march   are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for operations and debt service beyond the next months 
we based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong or are subject to change  and we may be required to use our available cash resources sooner than we currently expect 
if we acquire additional assets or companies  accelerate our product development programs or initiate additional clinical trials  we will need additional funds 
our future cash requirements will depend on a number of factors  including possible acquisitions  the continued progress of research and development of our product candidates  the timing and outcome 
table of contents of clinical trials and regulatory approvals  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending  and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the status of competitive products  the availability of financing  and our success in developing markets for our product candidates 
if we are not able to secure additional funding when needed  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our clinical trials or research and development programs 
the following table provides information as of december  with respect to the amounts and timing of our known contractual obligation payments due by period 
contractual obligations after in thousands total open purchase orders operating leases credit lines total the preceding table does not include information where the amounts of the obligations are not currently determinable  including contractual obligations in connection with product license agreements that include payments upon achievement of certain milestones 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
equity based compensation 
we recognize equity based compensation as an expense in our financial statements and that cost is measured at the fair value of the award and expensed over their vesting period 
equity based compensation arrangements to non employees are recorded at their fair value on the measurement date 
we estimate the grant date fair value of our stock option grants using a valuation model known as the black scholes merton formula or the black scholes model and allocate the resulting compensation expense over the corresponding requisite service period associated with each grant 
the black scholes model requires the use of several variables to estimate the grant date fair value of stock options including expected term  expected volatility  expected dividends and risk free interest rate 
we perform significant analyses to calculate and select the appropriate variable assumptions used in the black scholes model 
we also perform significant analyses to estimate forfeitures of equity based awards 
we are required to adjust our forfeiture estimates on at least an annual basis based on the number of share based awards that ultimately vest 
the selection of assumptions and estimated forfeiture rates is subject to significant judgment and future changes to our assumptions and estimates may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and intangible assets 
the allocation of the purchase price for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development  and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values 
additionally  we must determine whether an acquired entity is considered to be a business or a set of net assets  because a portion of the purchase price can only be allocated to goodwill in a business combination 
appraisals inherently require significant estimates and assumptions  including but not limited to  determining the timing and estimated costs to complete the in process research and development projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows  and developing appropriate discount rates 
we believe the estimated fair values assigned to the exakta opko assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions 
however  the fair value estimates for the purchase price allocation may change during the allowable allocation period  which is up to one year from the acquisition date  if additional information becomes available that would require changes to our estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts and revenue recognition 
generally  we recognize revenue from product sales when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to our customers 
certain of our products are sold directly to end users and require that we deliver  install and train the staff at the end users facility 
as a result  we do not recognize revenue until the product is delivered  installed and training has occurred 
return policies in certain international markets for our medical device products provide for stringent guidelines in accordance with the terms 
table of contents of contractual agreements with customers 
our estimates for sales returns are based upon the historical patterns of products returned matched against the sales from which they originated  and management s evaluation of specific factors that may increase the risk of product returns 
we analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts using the specific identification method 
our reported net loss is directly affected by management s estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets at december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in december  the fasb issued an amendment to the disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
the amendment specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the amendment also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures under current accounting guidance to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
the amendment is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this amendment is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statement disclosures 
in december  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting for goodwill impairment tests 
the amendment modifies step of the impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
the qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance 
the amendment is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is not permitted 
the adoption of this amendment is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting for annual excise taxes paid to the federal government by pharmaceutical manufacturers under health care reform 
the liability for the fee should be estimated and recorded in full upon the first qualifying branded prescription drug sale with a corresponding deferred cost that is amortized to expense using a straight line method of allocation unless another method better allocates the fee over the calendar year that it is payable 
the amendment is effective for calendar years beginning after december   when the fee initially becomes effective 
as we currently do not manufacture pharmaceutical products  we do not expect the adoption of this amendment to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in march  the fasb reached a consensus to issue an amendment to the accounting for revenue arrangements under which a vendor satisfies its performance obligations to a customer over a period of time  when the deliverable or unit of accounting is not within the scope of other authoritative literature  and when the arrangement consideration is contingent upon the achievement of a milestone 
the amendment defines a milestone and clarifies whether an entity may recognize consideration earned from the achievement of a milestone in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
this amendment is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
the amendment may be applied retrospectively to all arrangements or prospectively for milestones achieved after the effective date 
we have not adopted this guidance early and adoption of this amendment is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operation or financial condition 

table of contents in january  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting for fair value measurements and disclosures 
this amendment details additional disclosures on fair value measurements  requires a gross presentation of activities within a level rollforward  and adds a new requirement to disclose transfers in and out of level and level measurements 
the new disclosures are required of all entities that are required to provide disclosures about recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
this amendment is effective in the first interim or reporting period beginning after december   with an exception for the gross presentation of level rollforward information  which is required for annual reporting periods beginning after december   and for interim reporting periods within those years 
the adoption of this amendment did not have a material impact on our financial statement disclosures 
in october  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this amendment provides guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangements should be separated  and how the consideration paid should be allocated 
as a result of this amendment  entities may be able to separate multiple deliverable arrangements in more circumstances than under existing accounting guidance 
this guidance amends the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services based on objective evidence and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management s best estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
the existing guidance previously required that the fair value of the undelivered item reflect the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when the item is sold separately by the vendor 
if the fair value of all of the elements in the arrangement was not determinable  then revenue was deferred until all of the items were delivered or fair value was determined 
this amendment will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption and retrospective application is also permitted 
we are currently evaluating the potential effect of the adoption of this amendment on our results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of doing business  we are exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk although we do not speculate in the foreign exchange market  we may from time to time manage exposures that arise in the normal course of business related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by entering into offsetting positions through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts 
certain firmly committed transactions are hedged with foreign exchange forward contracts 
as exchange rates change  gains and losses on the exposed transactions are partially offset by gains and losses related to the hedging contracts 
both the exposed transactions and the hedging contracts are translated at current spot rates  with gains and losses included in earnings 
our derivative activities  which consist of foreign exchange forward contracts  are initiated to hedge forecasted cash flows that are exposed to foreign currency risk 
the foreign exchange forward contracts generally require us to exchange local currencies for foreign currencies based on pre established exchange rates at the contracts maturity dates 
as exchange rates change  gains and losses on these contracts are generated based on the change in the exchange rates that are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations at maturity  and offset the impact of the change in exchange rates on the foreign currency cash flows that are hedged 
if the counterparties to the exchange contracts do not fulfill their obligations to deliver the contracted currencies  we could be at risk for currency related fluctuations 
we enter into these contracts with counterparties that we believe to be creditworthy 
table of contents and do not enter into any leveraged derivative transactions 
we had million in foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at december  and million at december  primarily to hedge chilean based operating cash flows against us dollars 
if chilean pesos were to strengthen in relation to the us dollar  our loss or gain on hedged foreign currency cash flows would be offset by the derivative contracts  with a net effect of zero 
we do not engage in trading market risk sensitive instruments or purchasing hedging instruments or other than trading instruments that are likely to expose us to significant market risk  whether interest rate  foreign currency exchange  commodity price  or equity price risk 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk relates to our cash and investments and to our borrowings 
we maintain an investment portfolio of money market funds 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  and are  due to their very short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
because of the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that a change in market interest rates would have a significant negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio except for reduced income in a low interest rate environment 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
the weighted average interest rate related to our cash and cash equivalents for the year ended december  was 
as of december   the principal value of our credit lines was million  and have a weighted average interest rate of 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  bank obligations  repurchase agreements and high quality corporate issuers  and money market funds that invest in such debt instruments  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at an average maturity of generally less than three months
