item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking information the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve significant risks and uncertainties 
as a result of many factors  such as those set forth under risk factors in item a of this annual report on form k  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview we are an entrepreneurial pharmaceutical company that discovers  develops and intends to commercialize differentiated medicines that improve patients lives 
to achieve this  we are building a team  a culture and processes centered on creating and marketing important new drugs 
we believe that linaclotide  our gc c agonist being developed for the treatment of patients with ibs c or cc  could present patients and healthcare practitioners with a unique therapy for a major medical need not yet met by existing therapies 
linaclotide is our only product candidate that has demonstrated clinical proof of concept 
in addition to linaclotide  we have a pipeline of early stage  pre proof of concept development candidates in multiple therapeutic areas  including gastrointestinal disease  pain and inflammation  and respiratory disease 
we are also conducting early stage  preclinical research in these therapeutic areas  as well as in the area of cardiovascular disease 
we have pursued a partnering strategy for commercializing linaclotide that has enabled us to retain significant control over linaclotide development and commercialization  share the costs with high quality collaborators whose capabilities complement ours  and retain approximately half of linaclotide future long term value in the major pharmaceutical markets  should linaclotide meet our sales expectations 
we were incorporated in delaware as microbia  inc which was the name of our formerly majority owned subsidiary  on january  on april   we changed our name to ironwood pharmaceuticals  inc prior to september  we held a majority ownership interest in microbia  inc formerly known as microbia precision engineering  a subsidiary formed in september microbia  inc  or microbia  engaged in a specialty biochemicals business based on a proprietary strain development platform 
on september   we sold our interest in microbia to dsm holding company usa  inc  or dsm  in exchange for cash proceeds of million  the payment of approximately 
table of contents million of microbia debt and interest by dsm and future contingent consideration based on the sale of products incorporating microbia technology 
we currently operate in one reportable business segment human therapeutics 
our human therapeutics segment consists of the development and commercialization of our product candidates  including linaclotide 
prior to the sale of our interest in microbia  we also operated in the biomanufacturing segment 
our biomanufacturing segment  which comprised a much smaller part of our business  consisted of our majority ownership interest in microbia 
our human therapeutics segment represented and of our total assets at december  and  respectively  while our biomanufacturing segment represented approximately of our total assets at december  for the years ended december   and  results of operations of our biomanufacturing segment are included in net income loss from discontinued operations in our financial statements 
to date  we have dedicated substantially all of our activities to the research and development of our product candidates 
we have not generated any revenue to date from product sales and have incurred significant operating losses since our inception in we incurred net losses attributable to ironwood pharmaceuticals  inc of approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million and we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
financial overview revenue 
revenue to date from our human therapeutics segment is generated primarily through our collaboration agreement with forest and our license agreements with almirall and astellas 
the terms of these agreements include payment to us of one or more of the following nonrefundable  up front license fees  milestone payments  and royalties on product sales 
revenue from our human therapeutics segment is shown in our consolidated statements of operations as collaborative arrangements revenue 
revenue from our biomanufacturing segment was generated by our former subsidiary  microbia  which had entered into research and development service agreements with various third parties 
these agreements generally provided for fees for research and development services rendered 
as a result of the sale of our interest in microbia  revenue from our biomanufacturing segment is included in net income loss from discontinued operations 
we expect our revenue to fluctuate for the foreseeable future as our collaborative arrangements revenue is principally based on the achievement of clinical and commercial milestones 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists of expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of compensation  benefits and other employee related expenses  research and development related facility costs and third party contract costs relating to research  formulation  manufacturing  preclinical study and clinical trial activities 
the costs of revenue related to the microbia services contracts and costs associated with microbia research and development activities are included in net income loss from discontinued operations 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
under our forest collaboration agreement we are reimbursed for certain research and development expenses and we net these reimbursements against our research and development expenses as incurred 

table of contents our lead product candidate is linaclotide and it represents the largest portion of our research and development expense for our product candidates 
linaclotide is a first in class compound currently in phase clinical development for the treatment of ibs c and cc and is our only product candidate that has demonstrated clinical proof of concept 
in september and november  we announced the positive top line results from each of the two phase clinical trials assessing the safety and efficacy of linaclotide in patients with ibs c  and in november  we announced that we achieved positive results in each of our phase cc trials 
we have a pipeline of early stage  pre proof of concept development candidates in multiple therapeutic areas  including gastrointestinal disease  pain and inflammation  and respiratory disease 
we are also conducting early stage  preclinical research in these therapeutic areas  as well as in the area of cardiovascular disease 
the following table sets forth our research and development expenses related to our product pipeline for the years ended december   and these expenses relate primarily to external costs associated with manufacturing  preclinical studies and clinical trial costs 
costs related to facilities  depreciation  share based compensation and research and development support services are not directly charged to programs 
years ended december  unaudited in thousands demonstrated clinical proof of concept early stage early stage  preclinical we began tracking program expenses for linaclotide in  and research and development program expenses from inception to december  were approximately million 
the expenses for linaclotide include both reimbursements to us by forest as well as our portion of costs incurred by forest for linaclotide and invoiced to us under the cost sharing provisions of our collaboration agreement 
the lengthy process of securing fda approvals for new drugs requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals would materially adversely affect our product development efforts and our business overall 
accordingly  we cannot currently estimate with any degree of certainty the amount of time or money that we will be required to expend in the future on linaclotide or our other product candidates prior to their regulatory approval  if such approval is ever granted 
as a result of these uncertainties surrounding the timing and outcome of any approvals  we are currently unable to estimate precisely when  if ever  linaclotide  or any of our other product candidates will generate revenues and cash flows 
we invest carefully in our pipeline  and the commitment of funding for each subsequent stage of our development programs is dependent upon the receipt of clear  supportive data 
in addition  we are actively engaged in evaluating externally discovered drug candidates at all stages of development 
in evaluating potential assets  we apply the same criteria as those used for investments in internally discovered assets 
the majority of our external costs are spent on linaclotide  as costs associated with later stage clinical trials are  in most cases  more significant than those incurred in earlier stages of our pipeline 
we expect external costs related to the linaclotide program to begin decreasing provided that no other clinical trials are necessary to obtain regulatory approval in the us if our other product candidates are successful in early stage clinical trials  we would expect external costs to increase as the programs progress through later stage clinical trials 
the remainder of our research and development expense is not tracked by project as it consists primarily of our internal costs  and it benefits multiple projects that are in earlier stages of development and which typically share resources 

table of contents the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks including  but not limited to the duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type  complexity and novelty of the product candidate 
the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products  typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures  sampling activities and other costly and time consuming procedures 
data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development activity 
data obtained from these activities also are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
the duration and cost of discovery  nonclinical studies and clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a product candidate and are difficult to predict 
the costs  timing and outcome of regulatory review of a product candidate may not be favorable 
the emergence of competing technologies and products and other adverse market developments may negatively impact us 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine the duration and costs to complete current or future preclinical and clinical stages of our product candidates or when  or to what extent  we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates 
development timelines  probability of success and development costs vary widely 
we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which additional programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical data of each product candidate  as well as ongoing assessments of such product candidate commercial potential 
we expect our research and development costs to continue to be substantial for the foreseeable future and to increase with respect to our product candidates other than linaclotide as we advance those product candidates through preclinical studies and clinical trials 
additionally  our research and development costs will increase as we will fund full time equivalents for protagonist drug discovery activities under the terms of our collaboration agreement 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation  benefits and other employee related expenses for personnel in our administrative  finance  legal  information technology  business development  commercial and human resource functions 
other costs include the legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property  general and administrative related facility costs and professional fees for accounting and legal services 
as a result of our ipo in february  we have experienced and will likely continue to experience increases in general and administrative expense relating to operating as a public company 
these increases include legal fees  accounting fees  costs associated with implementing and complying with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of and the dodd frank wall street reform and protection act of and fees for investor relations services 
we also anticipate substantial increases in expenses related to developing the organization necessary to commercialize linaclotide 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain 
table of contents estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
these estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  available for sale securities  impairments of long lived assets  income taxes including the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  research and development expenses  contingencies  and share based compensation are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
prior to our ipo  we also evaluated our estimates and judgments regarding the fair value assigned to our common stock 
these critical estimates and assumptions are based on our historical experience  our observance of trends in the industry  and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that our application of the following accounting policies  each of which require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management  are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
as a result of the sale of our interest in microbia  we have presented the assets  liabilities  operations  and cash flows of microbia as discontinued operations for all periods presented prior to the sale 
revenue recognition our revenue is generated primarily through collaborative research and development and license agreements 
the terms of these agreements typically include payment to us of one or more of the following nonrefundable  up front license fees  milestone payments  the sale of drug substance to our collaborators  and royalties on product sales 
in addition  prior to september  we generated services revenue through agreements that generally provided for fees for research and development services rendered 
we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  services have been rendered or delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
we evaluate revenue from agreements that have multiple elements and account for those components as separate elements when the following criteria are met the delivered items have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items  and if there is a general right of return relative to the delivered items  delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and within our control 
the determination that multiple elements in an arrangement meet the criteria for separate units of accounting requires us to exercise our judgment 
the determination of whether we should recognize revenue on a gross or net basis involves judgment based on the relevant facts and circumstances  which relate primarily to whether we act as a principal or agent in the process of generating revenues from our collaboration and licensing arrangements 
for certain of our arrangements  particularly our license agreement with almirall  it is required that taxes be withheld on payments to us 
we have adopted a policy to recognize revenue net of these tax withholdings 

table of contents up front license fees we recognize revenues from nonrefundable  up front license fees related to collaboration and license agreements  including the million up front license fee under the forest collaboration agreement entered into in september and the million up front license fee  of which million was received net of foreign withholding taxes  under the almirall license agreement entered into in april  on a straight line basis over the contracted or estimated period of performance due to our continued involvement in research and development 
the period of performance over which the revenues are recognized is typically the period over which the research and or development is expected to occur 
as a result  we often are required to make estimates regarding drug development and commercialization timelines for compounds being developed pursuant to a collaboration or license agreement 
because the drug development process is lengthy and our collaboration and license agreements typically cover activities over several years  this approach has resulted in the deferral of significant amounts of revenue into future periods 
in addition  because of the many risks and uncertainties associated with the development of drug candidates  our estimates regarding the period of performance may change in the future 
any change in our estimates could result in substantial changes to the period over which the revenues from an up front license fee are recognized 
to date  we have had no material changes to our estimated periods of continuing involvement under existing collaboration and license agreements 
in the case where we cannot reliably estimate the period of performance due to our continued involvement in research and development  we defer the commencement of revenue recognition of the up front license fee until the earlier of either i the expected performance period of our joint steering committee obligations can be reasonably and reliably estimated or ii we are no longer contractually obligated to perform all joint steering committee duties 
as a result  at december   we deferred the entire million up front licensing fee received from astellas in november we began recognizing revenue from this up front payment from astellas in march  when an estimate of the development period could be derived 
milestones at the inception of each agreement that includes contingent milestone payments  we evaluate whether the contingencies underlying each milestone are substantive and at risk to both parties  specifically reviewing factors such as the scientific and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the milestone  as well as the level of effort and investment required 
if we do not consider a milestone to be substantive and at risk to both parties  the revenues from the related milestone payment cannot be recognized when the milestone is achieved  but must be recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining performance period 
all of the milestones that have been achieved to date under our forest collaboration agreement and our almirall license agreement have been considered substantive 
as of december   we had not achieved any milestones under our astellas license agreement 
in those circumstances where a substantive milestone is achieved  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and we have remaining obligations to perform under the collaboration arrangement  we recognize as revenue on the date the milestone is achieved an amount equal to the applicable percentage of the performance period that has elapsed as of the date the milestone is achieved  with the balance being deferred and recognized over the remaining period of performance 
payments received or reasonably assured after performance obligations are fully met are recognized as earned 
because the recognition of a substantive milestone under a collaboration agreement typically requires the completion of a number of activities conducted over a significant period of time  the expenses related to achieving the milestone often are incurred prior to the period in which the milestone payment is recognized 
when we do achieve milestones that we consider substantive under any of our collaborations  we may experience significant fluctuations in our 
table of contents collaborative revenues from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on the timing of achieving such substantive milestones 
services revenue prior to september  services revenue was recognized when there was persuasive evidence that an arrangement existed  services had been rendered or delivery had occurred  the price was fixed or determinable  and collection was reasonably assured 
revenue from research and development services rendered was recognized as services were performed 
as a result of the sale of our interest in microbia in september  services revenue is included in net income loss from discontinued operations 
research and development expense all research and development expenses are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses comprise costs incurred in performing research and development activities  including compensation  benefits and other employee costs  share based compensation expense  laboratory supplies and other direct expenses  facilities expenses  overhead expenses  contractual services  including clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing expenses  and other external expenses 
in addition  research and development expense includes reimbursements from forest for services performed pursuant to our collaboration agreement 
clinical trial expenses include expenses associated with cros 
the invoicing from cros for services rendered can lag several months 
we accrue the cost of services rendered in connection with cro activities based on our estimate of site management  monitoring costs  project management costs  and investigator fees 
we maintain regular communication with our cro vendors to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates 
differences between actual clinical trial expenses and estimated clinical trial expenses recorded have not been material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
under our forest collaboration agreement  we are reimbursed for certain research and development expenses and we net these reimbursements against our research and development expenses as incurred 
nonrefundable advance payments for research and development activities are capitalized and expensed over the related service period or as goods are received 
share based compensation expense prior to january   we accounted for employee share based awards  including stock options  to employees using the intrinsic value method 
under the intrinsic value method  compensation expense was measured on the date of award as the difference  if any  between the deemed fair value of our common stock and the option exercise price  multiplied by the number of options granted 
the option exercise prices and fair value of our common stock were determined by our management and board of directors based on a review of various objective and subjective factors 
no compensation expense was recorded for stock options issued to employees prior to january  for awards with fixed amounts and with fixed exercise prices at least equal to the fair value of our common stock at the date of grant 
effective january   we recognize compensation expense for all share based awards granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled on or after january   based on the grant date fair value 
these costs are recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for all time based vested awards 
we continue to account for share based awards granted prior to january  under the intrinsic value method 
we record the expense of services rendered by non employees based on the estimated fair value of the stock option using the black scholes option pricing model as of the respective vesting date 
further  we expense the fair value of non employee stock options over the vesting term of the underlying stock options 
for employee share based awards subsequent to january   we estimate the fair value of the share based awards  including stock options  using the black scholes option pricing model 
determining 
table of contents the fair value of share based awards requires the use of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the award and expected stock price volatility 
the weighted average assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards granted in  and are set forth below years ended december  volatility dividend yield expected life of options in years risk free interest rate the assumptions used in determining the fair value of share based awards represent management best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change  and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation could be materially different in the future 
the risk free interest rate used for each grant is based on a zero coupon us treasury instrument with a remaining term similar to the expected term of the share based award 
because we do not have a sufficient history to estimate the expected term  we use the simplified method for estimating the expected term 
the simplified method is based on the average of the vesting tranches and the contractual life of each grant 
because there was no public market for our common stock prior to our initial public offering  we lacked company specific historical and implied volatility information 
therefore  we estimate our expected stock volatility based on that of publicly traded peer companies  and we expect to continue to use this methodology until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our publicly traded stock price 
for purposes of identifying publicly traded peer companies  we selected publicly traded companies that are in the biopharmaceutical industry  have products or product candidates in similar therapeutic areas gastrointestinal dysfunction and pain management and stages of preclinical and clinical development as us  have sufficient trading history to derive a historic volatility rate and have similar vesting terms as our granted options 
we have not paid and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our shares of common stock  therefore  the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero 
we also recognize compensation expense for only the portion of options that are expected to vest 
accordingly  we have estimated expected forfeitures of stock options based on our historical forfeiture rate  adjusted for known trends  and used these rates in developing a future forfeiture rate 
our forfeiture rates were  and as of december   and  respectively 
if our actual forfeiture rate varies from our historical rates and estimates  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 
we have historically granted stock options at exercise prices not less than the fair value of our common stock as determined by our board of directors  with input from management 
due to the absence of an active market for our common stock  prior to our initial public offering on february   our board of directors has historically determined  with input from management  the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant based on a number of objective and subjective factors  including the prices at which we sold shares of convertible preferred stock  the superior rights and preferences of securities senior to our common stock at the time of each grant  the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event such as an initial public offering or sale of our company  our historical operating and financial performance and the status of our research and product development efforts  achievement of enterprise milestones  including our entering into collaboration and license agreements  and external market conditions affecting the biotechnology industry sector 

table of contents in connection with the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and  our board of directors also considered valuations provided by management in determining the fair value of our common stock 
such valuations were prepared as of march  june  october and december   and march  june  september  november and december   and valued our common stock at        and per share  respectively 
the valuations have been used to estimate the fair value of our common stock as of each option grant date and in calculating share based compensation expense 
our board of directors has consistently used the most recent quarterly valuation provided by management for determining the fair value of our common stock unless a specific event occurred that necessitated an interim valuation 
the valuations were prepared consistent with the american institute of certified public accountants practice aid  valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation  or the practice aid 
we used the guideline company method and the similar transaction method of the market approach  which compare our company to similar publicly traded companies or transactions  and an income approach  which looks at projected future cash flows  to value our company from among the alternatives discussed in the practice aid 
in addition  as we had several series of convertible preferred stock outstanding prior to our initial public offering in february  it was also necessary to allocate our company value to the various classes of stock  including stock options 
as provided in the practice aid  there are several approaches for allocating enterprise value of a privately held company among the securities held in a complex capital structure 
the possible methodologies include the probability weighted expected return method  the option pricing method and the current value method 
we used the probability weighted expected return method described in the practice aid to allocate the enterprise values to the common stock 
under this method  the value of our common stock is estimated based upon an analysis of future values for our company assuming various future outcomes  the timing of which is based on the plans of our board of directors and management 
under this approach  share value is based on the probability weighted present value of expected future investment returns  considering each of the possible outcomes available to us  as well as the rights of each share class 
we estimated the fair value of our common stock using a probability weighted analysis of the present value of the returns afforded to our stockholders under each of four possible future scenarios 
three of the scenarios assumed a stockholder exit  either through an ipo or a sale of our company 
the fourth scenario assumed a sale of our company at a value that is less than the cumulative amounts invested by our preferred stockholders 
for the march  valuation  we utilized a one product ipo scenario reflecting only linaclotide advancing in the clinic at the time of an ipo 
beginning with the october  valuation  we included two separate ipo scenarios to better reflect our company risk profile at that time 
the linaclotide program was by then advancing in two indications  cc and ibs c 
we believed that the ibs c indication had a significantly higher market value and higher clinical risk for ironwood 
to better reflect the potential liquidity outcomes for linaclotide  the first ipo scenario included an assumption of successful phase clinical trials for both the cc and ibs c indications at the time of an ipo  and the second ipo scenario reflected successful phase clinical trials in only the cc indication at the time of the ipo 
for both ipo scenarios and the sale scenario  the estimated future values of our common stock were calculated using assumptions including the expected pre money or sale valuations based on the market approach  and the income approach using the discounted cash flow method  and the expected dates of the future expected ipo or sale 
for the sale at an assumed price less than the liquidation preference scenario  the estimated future and present values of our common stock were calculated using assumptions including the estimated aggregate enterprise value that could be attained through such a sale and the estimated expected date of the future sale 
the present values of our common stock under each scenario were then calculated using a risk adjusted discount rate 
finally  the calculated present values for our common stock were probability weighted based on our 
table of contents estimate of the relative occurrence of each scenario to derive the concluded value of our common stock 
there are significant judgments and estimates inherent in the determination of these valuations 
these judgments and estimates included assumptions regarding our future performance  the time to completing an ipo or other liquidity event  and the timing of and probability of launching our product candidate as well as determinations of the appropriate valuation methods 
if we had made different assumptions  our share based compensation expense  net loss and net loss per share could have been significantly different 
we have also granted performance based stock options with terms that allow the recipients to vest in a specific number of shares based upon the achievement of performance based milestones as specified in the grants 
share based compensation expense associated with these performance based stock options is recognized if the performance condition is considered probable of achievement using management best estimates of the time to vesting for the achievement of the performance based milestones 
if the actual achievement of the performance based milestones varies from our estimates  share based compensation expense could be materially different than what is recorded in the period 
the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated time to vesting for performance based stock options will be recognized as compensation cost in the period of the revision  and recorded as a change in estimate 
we have also granted time accelerated stock options with terms that allow the acceleration in vesting of the stock options upon the achievement of performance based milestones specified in the grants 
share based compensation expense associated with these time accelerated stock options is recognized over the requisite service period of the awards or the implied service period  if shorter 
while the assumptions used to calculate and account for share based compensation awards represents management best estimates  these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if revisions are made to our underlying assumptions and estimates  our share based compensation expense could vary significantly from period to period 
the total estimated compensation cost related to non vested stock options and stock awards  with time based vesting  not yet recognized was approximately million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
the weighted average period over which this expense is expected to be recognized is approximately years 
at december   approximately million of additional share based compensation related to options subject to performance based milestone vesting was not yet recognized 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements located in this annual report on form k for further discussion of share based compensation 
fair value of financial instruments in september  we entered into a collaboration agreement with forest  which included a contingent equity investment in the form of a forward purchase contract  which required forest to purchase  shares of our series g convertible preferred stock at a price of per share if we achieved a specific clinical milestone 
this preferred stock  which was issued to forest in september  had rights and conditions substantially identical to our outstanding preferred stock prior to the issuance 
these shares of convertible preferred stock converted into  shares of our class b common stock at the time of our ipo in february in april  we entered into a license agreement with almirall  which also included a contingent equity investment in the form of a forward purchase contract  which required almirall to purchase  shares of our series i convertible preferred stock  if a specific clinical milestone was met  at a price of per share 
the milestone in this agreement was a different milestone from the one contained in the forest collaboration agreement 
this preferred stock  which was issued to almirall and 
table of contents for which we received million of cash proceeds on november   had rights and conditions substantially identical to our outstanding preferred stock 
these shares of convertible preferred stock converted into  shares of our class b common stock at the time of our ipo in february we evaluated both of these financial instruments and determined that because we may have been required to settle these instruments by transferring assets to forest and almirall due to deemed liquidation provisions of the preferred stock  these instruments should have been considered assets or liabilities 
each contingent equity investment was assessed at fair market value at its inception 
a significant input in the valuation of the forward purchase contracts was the fair value of our convertible preferred shares which were estimated using the probability weighted expected return method 
under the probability weighted expected return method  the value of our convertible preferred shares was calculated based on an analysis of potential future values of our company assuming various future liquidity events  the timing and amount of which were based on estimates from our company management 
the resulting preferred share value was based on the probability weighted present value of the expected future returns  considering each of the possible outcomes as well as the rights of each preferred share class 
at each measurement date  assumptions used in the probability weighted expected return model  including future values  liquidity dates and scenario weightings  were consistent with the assumptions used in our common stock valuations at such time  as described above 
the calculated discount or premium from the pre determined price paid by forest and almirall for their shares in excess of the estimated fair value of our convertible preferred stock at the expected time of meeting the respective milestone was then discounted using a company risk adjusted rate consistent with the common stock valuations being performed at the time to arrive at the present value of the respective forward purchase contract 
at the inception of the forest collaboration agreement  the fair value of our convertible preferred stock to be issued upon the achievement of the milestone was equal to the sum of the probability weighted present values for the four identified possible exit scenarios initial public offering either one product ipo or two product ipo or later a one indication ipo and two indication ipo  sale and sale at an assumed price below the liquidation preference  all with june  as the expected milestone achievement date 
the probability weight assigned to the two product ipo scenario was and the probability weight assigned to the one product ipo scenario was 
the probability weight assigned to the sale scenario was and the probability weight assigned to the sale at an assumed price less than the liquidation preference scenario was 
the resulting enterprise values for each scenario were discounted to an estimated investment date of october   using a risk adjusted discount rate of 
based on this calculation  the fair value of the convertible preferred stock to be issued upon achievement of the forest milestone was valued at per share 
the resulting difference of per share between the fair value of and the purchase price of per share represented the estimated premium forest would pay above the fair value of the convertible preferred stock 
this per share premium was then adjusted by the probability of achieving the milestone  which was estimated at  based on clinical risk  resulting in a probability adjusted premium of per share 
the resulting total premium was then discounted as of september  using a company risk adjusted discount rate of 
as a result  the forest contingent equity investment was valued at the inception of the agreement to be million  which represents the fair value of the premium that forest would pay for shares of our stock should the milestone be achieved 
the fair value of our convertible preferred stock to be issued upon the achievement of the almirall milestone at the inception of the license agreement in april was equal to the sum of the probability weighted present values for the four identified possible exit scenarios one indication ipo  two indication ipo  sale and sale at an assumed price less than the liquidation preference  all with september  as the expected event date 
the resulting enterprise values for each scenario were discounted as of the investment date which was estimated to be october  based on this calculation  the fair value of the convertible preferred stock to be issued upon achievement of the 
table of contents almirall milestone was estimated at per share 
the resulting difference of per share between the estimated fair value of and the purchase price of per share is the estimated premium almirall will pay above the fair value of the convertible preferred stock 
this per share premium was then adjusted by the probability of achieving the milestone  which was estimated at  resulting in a probability adjusted premium of per share 
the resulting total premium was then discounted as of april  at 
as a result  the almirall contingent equity investment was valued at the inception of the agreement to be million  which represents the fair value of the premium that almirall would pay for shares of our stock should the milestone be achieved 
in addition to valuing these instruments at their inception  we were also required to remeasure the fair value of our contingent equity investments at each reporting period  using current assumptions  with changes in value recorded as other income or expense 
at december   we remeasured the fair value of the forest contingent equity investment using valuation methodologies consistent with those used at inception  updated for current assumptions 
based on these calculations  the fair value of the convertible preferred stock to be issued upon achievement of the forest milestone was estimated at per share 
the resulting difference of per share was then adjusted by an updated probability of achieving the milestone  which was now estimated at  resulting in a probability adjusted premium of per share 
the resulting total premium was then discounted as of december  using a risk adjusted discount rate of

the increase in revenue from collaborative arrangements for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to increases in revenue from the almirall license agreement  which we entered into in april  and the astellas license agreement  which we entered into in november  offset by decreases in revenue from the forest collaboration 
in the year ended december   we recognized approximately million of revenue  compared with approximately million of revenue in  related to the million up front license payment received in may from almirall and the amortization of the deferred revenue resulting from recording the initial million valuation of the almirall forward purchase contract

the increase in research and development expense of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in compensation  benefits  and employee related expenses associated mainly with increased headcount  an increase of approximately million due to the implementation in the first quarter of of our employee incentive plan  an increase of approximately million in share based compensation expense primarily related to our annual stock option grant made in february  an increase of approximately million in research and development related facilities and other research and development support costs largely due to increased rent and depreciation expense associated with the additional space we leased at our binney street facility in february and an increase of approximately million in internal research costs  such as laboratory supplies  to support the development of our pipeline  offset by a decrease of approximately million in support of linaclotide  primarily resulting from lower clinical trial  collaboration and manufacturing expenses as we completed the efficacy portion of linaclotide development program 
general and administrative expense 
the increase in general and administrative expense of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in compensation  benefits and other employee related expenses associated with increased headcount  an increase of approximately million in share based compensation expense primarily related to our annual stock option grant made in february  an increase of approximately million due to the implementation in the first quarter of of our employee incentive plan  an increase of approximately million in general and administrative related facilities costs primarily due to increased rent expense associated with the additional space we leased at our binney street facility in february  an increase of approximately million in expenses due to being a public company  such as audit and tax fees  filing fees  and directors and officers insurance and an increase in external consulting costs of approximately million primarily associated with preparing to commercialize linaclotide and public company requirements  such as investor relations  sarbanes oxley compliance and stock administration offset by an increase of approximately million in the reimbursement from forest on our collaborative commercial activities

the decrease in interest expense of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily the result of a reduction in long term debt  partially offset by early payment fees incurred in connection with the repayment of the long term debt in september interest and investment income 
the increase in interest and investment income of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was due to higher average cash  cash equivalents and investment balances  partially offset by lower prevailing interest rates during the period 
remeasurement of forward purchase contracts 
the decrease in the remeasurement of forward purchase contracts of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  resulted from the final settlement of the forest forward purchase contract in july and the almirall forward purchase contract in november the forest forward purchase contract was remeasured in july when forest made its equity investment and the almirall forward purchase contract was remeasured at november  when almirall made its equity investment  resulting in total respective gains on remeasurement of million and million for the year ended december  as a result of the final settlements of both forward purchase contracts  there were no corresponding remeasurements during other income 
the increase in other income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to approximately  in grants awarded to us under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program in there was no corresponding award in income tax benefit 
the approximately million increase in income tax benefit for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was related to intra period income tax allocation requirements for which we recorded a benefit for income taxes from continuing operations of approximately million  offset by an identical income tax provision from discontinued operations for the year ended december  the intra period income tax allocation considers discontinued operations for purposes of determining the amount of tax benefit that results from our loss from continuing operations 
net income loss from discontinued operations 
the approximately million increase in net income loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily the result of the approximately million gain recognized on the sale of microbia in september and lower operating expenses of microbia resulting from reduced headcount and rent expense associated with microbia november restructuring activities  partially offset by the tax provision related to the intra period tax allocation 

table of contents net income loss from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interest 
the approximately million increase in net income from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interest for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase in net income for microbia due to a gain recognized on the settlement of intercompany balances immediately prior to the sale of microbia in september and lower operating expenses of microbia resulting from reduced headcount and rent expense associated with microbia november restructuring activities 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue years ended december  change dollars in thousands collaborative arrangements revenue collaborative arrangements 
the increase in revenue from collaborative arrangements of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to increases in revenue from the forest collaboration and the almirall license agreement 
during the year ended december   we recognized approximately million of revenue related to a million forest milestone payment we received in july  and a total of approximately million of revenue related to the million up front license payment received from almirall in may and the amortization of the deferred revenue resulting from recording the initial million valuation of the almirall forward purchase contract 
additionally  in  we recognized approximately million in revenue related to the initial sale of development material to almirall 
these increases were partially offset by an incremental approximately million of revenue recognized in the year ended december  related to the initial recognition upon achievement of a clinical milestone in september under the forest collaboration 
operating expenses years ended december  change dollars in thousands operating expenses research and development general and administrative total operating expenses research and development expense 
the increase in research and development expense of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in expenses primarily associated with the phase clinical trials for linaclotide and an increase of approximately million in spending for compensation  benefits and other employee related expenses resulting from an increase in headcount to support our linaclotide program

other income expense  net years ended december  change dollars in thousands other income expense interest expense interest and investment income remeasurement of forward purchase contracts total other income expense  net interest expense 
the increase in interest expense for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was a result of additional borrowings in under our debt facility as well as two new capital leases that we entered into in interest and investment income 
the decrease in interest and investment income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was due to lower average cash balances and lower prevailing interest rates during the period 
remeasurement of forward purchase contracts 
the increase in the fair value of the forward purchase contracts for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  resulted from changes in the fair value of the forest and almirall forward purchase contracts at the time of remeasurement 
the valuation of the forest forward purchase contract for the year ended december  increased million as compared to a decrease of million for the year ended december  the large decrease in the valuation of the forest forward purchase contract was primarily a result of an increase in the fair value of our convertible preferred stock at the time of remeasurement 
this increase was driven by higher estimated enterprise values and a lower risk adjusted interest rate assumption used in our valuation 
as a result  at december   the valuation of the forest forward purchase contract decreased 
the almirall forward purchase contract valuation increased million in the year ended december  without a corresponding change in the year ended december  as we entered into the license agreement with almirall in april income tax benefit 
the approximately million increase in income tax benefit for the year ended december  was related to a refundable federal research and development tax credit 
we received approximately million of this refund in october and we received approximately million in october net loss attributable to discontinued operations 
the approximately million increase in net loss attributable to discontinued operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was due to a larger net loss associated with our former subsidiary  microbia

table of contents funding requirements to date  we have not commercialized any products and have not achieved profitability 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial net losses for the next several years as we further develop and prepare for the potential commercial launch of linaclotide  continue to invest in our pipeline  develop the organization required to sell our product candidates and operate as a publicly traded company 
we have generated revenue from services  up front license fees and milestones  but have not generated any product revenue since our inception and do not expect to generate any product revenue from our collaborative arrangements or the sale of products unless we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale of linaclotide 
we believe that our cash on hand as of the date of this annual report on form k and additional cash milestone payments we may receive from our current and future collaborators give us substantial strategic optionality and will enable us to operate the company in a productive way  through at least our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations  including the underlying estimates regarding the costs to obtain regulatory approval and the costs to commercialize linaclotide  is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially and negatively as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in the risk factors section of this annual report on form k 
we have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of our product candidates  we are unable to estimate precisely the amounts of capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to complete the development of  and to obtain regulatory approval for  linaclotide and our other product candidates for all of the indications for which we believe each product candidate is suited 
our funding requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  the following the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates  the rate of progress and cost of our commercialization activities  the success of our research and development efforts  the expenses we incur in marketing and selling our product candidates  the revenue generated by sales of our product candidates  the emergence of competing or complementary technological developments  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the terms and timing of any additional collaborative  licensing or other arrangements that we may establish  and the acquisition of businesses  products and technologies 
contractual commitments and obligations under our collaborative agreement with forest  we share equally with forest all development and commercialization costs related to linaclotide in the us the actual amounts that we pay forest or that forest pays to us will depend on numerous factors outside of our control  including the success of our clinical development efforts with respect to linaclotide  the content and timing of decisions made by the fda  the reimbursement and competitive landscape around linaclotide and our other product candidates  and other factors described under the heading risk factors 

table of contents our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to cros 
the contracts with cros generally are cancellable  with notice  at our option and do not have any cancellation penalties 
these items are not included in the table below 
in june  we entered into a commercial supply agreement with a contract manufacturing organization for the purchase of a portion of the linaclotide api that will be used to seek regulatory approval of linaclotide in the us  canada and or mexico  and  depending on such approval  that would be used for commercial sales in such countries 
the commercial supply agreement contains minimum purchase requirements that commence with the commercial launch of linaclotide and that are dependent upon forecasted commercial requirements 
since  at this time  linaclotide has not yet been approved for commercialization and future commercial demand for linaclotide is unknown  the table below does not include an estimate of our future minimum purchase requirements under the commercial supply agreement 
in connection with our collaboration agreement with protagonist entered into in february  we are obligated to make an up front payment to protagonist 
we will also fund full time equivalents for protagonist drug discovery activities 
due to the uncertainties involved in the discovery phase of a product candidate  we are unable to determine the duration and costs required to complete protagonist drug discovery activities and as a result  we have not included these amounts in the table below 
pending the achievement of certain development and commercialization milestones  we will make certain milestone and royalty payments 
as these payments are contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events and  given the nature of these events  it is unclear when  if ever  we may be required to pay such amounts and as a result  these contingent payments have not been included in the table below

under the amended lease  we leased an additional  square feet of the binney street building 
rent for the additional space commences no later than february and base rent will be per rentable square foot per year  and will increase annually by per rentable square foot 
the landlord will provide us with a finish work allowance of per rentable square foot of additional space rented pursuant to this amendment

almirall accounted for approximately and of our revenue from continuing operations for the years ended december  and  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements as that term is defined in item a ii of regulation s k or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships 
we enter into guarantees in the ordinary course of business related to the guarantee of our own performance and the performance of our subsidiaries 
new accounting pronouncements from time to time  new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date 
unless otherwise discussed  we believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations upon adoption 
recently issued accounting standards in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu asu amends existing revenue recognition accounting pronouncements that are currently within the scope of fasb accounting standards codification subtopic previously included within eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
the consensus to asu provides accounting principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangement should be separated  and the consideration allocated 
this guidance eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
eitf previously required that the fair value of the undelivered item be the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when the item is sold separately by the vendor 
under eitf  if the fair value of all of the elements in the arrangement was not determinable  then revenue was deferred until all of the items were delivered or fair value was determined 
this new approach is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  and allows for retrospective application 
as this guidance is applicable to future transactions  we do not expect the implementation to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition milestone method  or asu asu provides guidance in applying the milestone method of revenue recognition to research or development arrangements 
under this guidance management may recognize revenue contingent upon the achievement of a milestone in its entirety  in the period in which the milestone is 
table of contents achieved  only if the milestone meets all the criteria within the guidance to be considered substantive 
this asu is effective on a prospective basis for research and development milestones achieved in fiscal years  beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted  however  adoption of this guidance as of a date other than january  requires application of this guidance retrospectively effective as of january  and disclosure of the effect of this guidance as applied to all previously reported interim periods in the fiscal year of adoption 
as we plan to implement asu no 
prospectively  the effect of this guidance will be limited to future transactions 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 fees paid to the federal government by pharmaceutical manufacturers  or asu  which provides guidance on how to recognize and classify the fees mandated by the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act  together the acts 
the acts impose an annual fee for each calendar year beginning on or after january  the liability for the fee should be estimated and recorded in full upon the first qualifying sale with a corresponding deferred cost that is amortized to expense using a straight line method of allocation over the calendar year that it is payable 
as we do not currently have a commercial product  the effect of this guidance will be limited to future transactions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  principally deposits  securities issued by the us government and its agencies and money market instruments 
the goals of our investment policy are preservation of capital  fulfillment of liquidity needs and fiduciary control of cash and investments 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of interest rates  particularly because our investments are in short term marketable securities 
due to the short term duration of our investment portfolio and the low risk profile of our investments  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
accordingly  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
recently  there has been concern in the credit markets regarding the value of a variety of mortgage backed and auction rate securities and the resulting effect on various securities markets 
we do not currently have any auction rate securities 
we do not believe our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investments have significant risk of default or illiquidity 
while we believe our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities do not contain excessive risk  we cannot provide absolute assurance that in the future our investments will not be subject to adverse changes in market value 
in addition  we maintain significant amounts of cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities at one or more financial institutions that are in excess of federally insured limits 
given the current instability of financial institutions  we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience losses on these deposits 
our capital lease obligations bear interest at a fixed rate and therefore have minimal exposure to changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk we have no operations outside the us and do not have any foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments 

table of contents effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation and changing prices over the years ended december   and had a significant impact on our results of operations
