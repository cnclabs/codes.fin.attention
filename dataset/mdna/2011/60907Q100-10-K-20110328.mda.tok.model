these statements also relate to our business strategy  goals and expectations concerning our market position  future operations  margins  profitability  liquidity  and capital resources 
the words believe  anticipate  could  estimate  expect  intend  may  plan  predict  project  will  and similar terms and phrases identify forward looking statements in this report and in the documents incorporated by reference in this report 
although we believe the assumptions upon which these forward looking statements are based are reasonable  any of these assumptions could prove to be inaccurate and the forward looking statements based on these assumptions could be incorrect 
our operations involve risks and uncertainties  many of which are outside of our control  and any one of which  or a combination of which  could materially affect our results of operations and whether the forward looking statements ultimately prove to be correct 
actual results and trends in the future may differ materially from those suggested or implied by the forward looking statements depending on a number of factors 
factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expected include the following changes in interest rates  changes in economic conditions in our market area  greater loan losses than anticipated  the effect on us and our industry of difficult market conditions  unprecedented volatility and the soundness of other financial institutions  the effect of recent legislative regulatory initiatives  our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive financial services industry  the effect of our concentration in loans secured by real estate  the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses  our ability to obtain additional capital in the future on terms that are favorable  other factors described under risk factors above 
because of these uncertainties  our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward looking statements 
in addition  our past results of operations do not necessarily indicate our future results 
therefore  we caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward looking information and statements 

table of contents we will not update the forward looking statements to reflect actual results or changes in the factors affecting the forward looking statements 
overview the purpose of this discussion is to provide information about the major components of our results of operations and financial condition  liquidity and capital resources 
the discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes to assist in the evaluation of our performance 
we generate a significant amount of our income from the net interest income earned by monarch bank 
net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense 
interest income depends on the amount of interest earning assets outstanding during the period and the interest rates earned thereon 
monarch bank s cost of money is a function of the average amount of deposits and borrowed money outstanding during the period and the interest rates paid thereon 
the quality of the assets further influences the amount of interest income lost on non accrual loans and the amount of additions to the allowance for loan losses 
we also generate income from non interest sources 
non interest income sources include bank related service charges  fee income from residential mortgage sales  fee income from the sale of investment and insurance services  income from bank owned life insurance boli policies  as well as gains or losses from the sale of investment securities 
analysis of operating results net income our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  the bank and its subsidiaries  after all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated 
net income attributable to our noncontrolling interests of  and  respectively  are deducted for the years ended december   and  after the income tax provision  to arrive at net income attributable to monarch financial holdings  inc the ensuing references and ratios are related to net income attributable to monarch financial holdings  inc  hereon referred to as net income after net income attributable to noncontrolling interest has been deducted 
income before taxes income tax provision net income less net income attributable to noncontrolling interest net income attributable to monarch financial holdings  inc we reported net income for december  of  compared to  for december  our basic earnings per share were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
diluted earnings per share were for december   and for december  two important and commonly used measures of profitability are return on assets net income as a percentage of average total assets and return on shareholders equity net income as a percentage of average shareholders equity 
our returns on average assets were and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the returns on average shareholders equity were  and for the same time periods 
our net income for the year ended december  of  was a new company record 
it represented an increase of compared to both net interest income and noninterest income growth were contributing factors but noninterest income growth was the predominant source of our increased income in net interest income increased million or to million in compared to earning asset growth coupled with higher yields was further enhanced by the addition of lower cost liabilities 
loans held for sale increased million and loans held for investment grew million  while the combined yield on these assets improved basis points 
deposits increased million during the year while our overall costs associated with deposits declined basis points 
the increase in deposits provided the funding source for our loan growth and also allowed us to pay down our borrowings  which further benefited net interest income 

table of contents non interest income increased million to million in mortgage banking income increased million  or for a total of million 
high production  driven by record low mortgage rates  coupled with market expansion of monarch mortgage  our mortgage division  is the primary source of this growth 
non interest expenses increased million to million in  compared to million in the majority of these increases were in salaries and benefits  specifically commissions  loan origination expenses  and occupancy  primarily related to our mortgage production and expansion 
provision for loan losses were million in compared to million  one year prior 
our loan portfolio is a primary focus of our management team 
this increase was due to the decline of economic conditions in our markets 
the net effect on pre tax and pre noncontrolling interest income was an increase of  or  to  compared to  in net interest income net interest income  a significant source of revenue  is the excess of interest income over interest expense 
net interest income is influenced by a number of factors  including the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the interest rates earned on earning assets  and the interest rates paid to obtain funding to support the assets 
net interest income was  for the year ended december  this represents an increase of  or over when net interest income was  rates have remained at an historical low over the past two years 
we have been at  or near  the bottom of an economic downturn that began late in at that time  the federal reserve open market committee fomc  which sets the federal funds rate  began to decrease target funds in an effort to stabilize the economy and head off a recession 
between september and december they decreased the target funds rate a total of basis points which resulted in the current  historically low  federal funds rate of 
wall street journal prime wsjp  which moves in tandem with the federal funds target rate  has held at 
in we focused on building our core deposit base to reduce our reliance on noncore funding sources and to support the production related growth of our loans held for sale 
at the same time  we worked to stabilize our loans held for sale by strengthening and supporting our existing client base  promoting disciplined growth with regard to new clients  and promoting short term fixed rate loan pricing  our loans held for investment increased million in although we financed a million in new loans 
during the same period  our outstanding loans held for sale have increased nearly times 
the mortgage industry  which is sensitive to interest rates  offered historically low rates for much of  leading to high production in both the purchase money and refinance markets 
total interest income was  in compared to  in loan yield is the result of both the interest rate and any fees collected on a loan 
interest and fees on loans are the largest component of our interest income 
interest and fees on loans increased our commercial and mortgage portfolios to a blended yield of in compared to in our consumer loan portfolio primarily consists of home equity lines of credit  plus loans held for sale portfolio  for the short period between origination and when they are delivered to the investor 
balances in our home equity lines of credit have remained level over the past two years 
these loans are low  variable rate loans that float with wsjp 
the increase in volume of loans held for sale has had the impact of lowering the overall yield on our consumer portfolio to in  compared to in the disciplined growth in our loans held for investment offset lower yields in our loans held for sale  increasing in the overall yield of our loan portfolio to  up from  one year prior 
total interest expense declined  or to  for the year ended december   compared to on average  interest bearing deposits represent of interest bearing liabilities in and in our reliance on higher cost  longer term time deposits has decreased with the significant growth in our money market deposits 
in addition  of our time deposits outstanding at december  matured and were re priced in lower overall costs associated with money market accounts coupled with re pricing of time deposits has resulted in our deposit cost declining  or reducing our blended interest cost to in when compared to in 
table of contents additional analysis with regard to interest income will reference the following tables 
for discussion purposes  our net interest income analysis and our changes in net interest income rate volume analysis tables are adjusted to include tax equivalent income on bank owned life insurance boli that is not in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap

table of contents table presents changes in net interest income in a rate volume analysis format 
the goal of a rate volume analysis is to compare two or more earning periods to determine whether the difference between the results of those periods is due to changes in rate  or volume  or some combination of the two 
this is achieved through a what if analysis 
we calculate what the potential income would have been in the new period if the prior period rate had remained unchanged  and compare that result to what the potential income would have been in the prior period if the current rates were in effect 
through the analysis of these income potentials  we are able to determine how much of the dollar change between periods is due to the impact of differing rates and how much is volume driven 
net interest income has been adjusted to include income from boli 
our net interest income improved in compared to primarily through volume 
growth in our commercial  real estate  and consumer portfolios contributed million to interest income 
changes in rate provided additional income of million  with higher yields on our commercial and real estate loans contributing million 
this increase was reduced thousand by lower yields in our consumer loans 
our loans held for sale are included in consumer loans and the impact of the historic low mortgage rates reduced our earnings potential 
lower interest rates on our securities portfolio reduced our earnings potential by thousand 
this reduction was only partially offset by growth in our federal agencies agencies portfolio 
many of our agencies carry call features which the seller has exercised due to continued low rates 
replacement securities carry a lower yield 
lower interest expense contributed an additional million to net interest income in reductions in liability cost of million were partially offset by growth related increases of million 
interest bearing deposits  which are the primary source of interest expense  grew an average of million in at a potential cost of million which was more than offset by a million savings potential due to rate reductions 
time deposits increased an average million at a cost of thousand  but lower overall rates contributed a potential savings of million 
other borrowings provided additional reductions through lower rates

table of contents market risk management we spend a great deal of time focusing on the management of the balance sheet to maximize net interest income 
our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility  and our primary objectives for managing interest rate volatility are to identify opportunities to maximize net interest income while ensuring adequate liquidity and carefully managing interest rate risk 
the asset liability management committee alco  which is composed of executive officers  is responsible for monitoring corporate financial performance  meeting liquidity requirements  establishing interest rate parameters  indices  and terms for loan and deposit products  assessing and evaluating the competitive rate environment  monitoring and measuring interest rate risk 
interest rate risk refers to the exposure of our earnings and market value of portfolio equity mve to changes in interest rates 
the magnitude of the change in earnings and mve resulting from interest rate changes is impacted by the time remaining to maturity on fixed rate obligations  the contractual ability to adjust rates prior to maturity  competition  and the general level of interest rates and customer actions 
there are several common sources of interest rate risk that must be effectively managed if there is to be minimal impact on our earnings and capital 
repricing risk arises largely from timing differences in the pricing of assets and liabilities 
reinvestment risk refers to the reinvestment of cash flows from interest payments and maturing assets at lower or higher rates 
basis risk exists when different yield curves or pricing indices do not change at precisely the same time or in the same magnitude such that assets and liabilities with the same maturity are not all affected equally 
yield curve risk refers to unequal movements in interest rates across a full range of maturities 
in determining the appropriate level of interest rate risk  alco reviews the changes in net interest income and mve given various changes in interest rates 
we also consider the most likely interest rate scenarios  local economics  liquidity needs  business strategies  and other factors in determining the appropriate levels of interest rate risk 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  simulation analysis is used to determine the impact on net interest income and mve from changes in interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity analysis presents the amount of assets and liabilities that are estimated to reprice through specified periods if there are no changes in balance sheet mix 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis in table reflects our assets and liabilities on december  that will either be repriced in accordance with market rates  mature or are estimated to mature early or prepay within the periods indicated 
this is a one day position that is continually changing and is not necessarily indicative of our position at any other time 
interest bearing demand deposits and money market balances are considered interest sensitive for of the outstanding balances 
management believes this structure makes for a more accurate and meaningful view of our interest sensitivity position 
as illustrated in the table  we appear to be liability sensitive at three months or less  primarily due to our large money market base 
our time deposit maturities are closely matched with those of our loans and securities 
with the majority of our borrowings and deposits short  our current structure allows us pricing flexibility to react to changes in rates when they occur 

table of contents table interest rate sensitivity analysis in thousands december  months or less months to year year to years years to years years total interest sensitive assets interest bearing deposits and federal funds sold securities loans bank owned life insurance total interest sensitive assets interest sensitive liabilities now and savings deposits money market deposits time deposits other borrowings total interest sensitive liabilities interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap percentage cumulative gap to total interest sensitive assets because of inherent limitations in interest rate sensitivity analysis  alco uses more sophisticated interest rate risk measurement techniques 
simulation analysis is used to subject the current repricing conditions to rising interest rates in increments of   and and falling interest rates in decrements of and to determine how net interest income changes for the next twelve months under two rate assumptions 
the assumptions are shocked  in which the entire rate change is assumed to have occurred in a single month  and ramped  in which the rate change is assumed to have occurred spread throughout the twelve month period 
alco also applies a shocked and ramped assumption when measuring the effects of changes in interest rates on mve by discounting future cash flows of deposits and loans using new rates at which deposits and loans would be made to similar depositors and borrowers 
market value changes in the investment portfolio are estimated by discounting future cash flows and using duration analysis 
loan and investment security prepayments are estimated using current market information 
table shows the estimated impact of changes in interest rates up   and and down and  on net interest income and on mve as of december  in thousands 
the projected change in net interest income to changes in interest rates at december   were in compliance with our established guidelines for increases of    and and decreases of  under both the shocked and ramped assumptions 
however for decreases of the shocked result is not within our guidelines 
the projected change in mve to changes in interest rates at december   was in compliance with established policy guidelines for increases of   and  and decreases in rate of  under both the shocked and ramped assumptions as well 
however  the projected changes in income were not in compliance for either assumption under a decrease in rate of 
these projected changes in the mve model are based on numerous assumptions of growth and changes in the mix of assets or liabilities 
the positive gap in the interest rate sensitivity analysis indicates that our net interest income would rise if rates increase and fall if rates decline 
the simulation analysis supports the actions that management has made with regard to shortening of maturities and the introduction of short term fixed pricing on loans coupled with deposit rate and term adjustments to position the company for future changes in rates 
we continue to focus on compliance through the tightening of lending guidelines and the establishment of floors for certain products

we continue to offer investment services  on a smaller scale  through our investment division  monarch investments 
service charges continued to grow with deposits  but at a much slower pace 
in june changes by the federal reserve to regulation e limited the ability of banks to charge fees for paying overdrafts caused by atm and debit card transactions 
these changes adversely impacted our overdraft nsf program  by limiting the forms of transactions to be covered for a retail client who overdraws their accounts without the negative stigma associated with a returned check 
this program was initiated in with broad customer acceptance 
service charge pricing on deposit accounts is typically reevaluated annually to reflect current costs and competition 
there were no security gains or losses in either or the net gain of  on the sale of other real estate in resulted from the sale of sixteen properties

our expansion of mortgage operations continued in with the addition of offices 
in addition we opened a banking office  hired additional lenders and support staffing which has increased the number of our employees by at december   we employed a total of full and part time employees compared to at year end in addition  higher compensation related benefits such as social security taxes and medicare taxes expenses have contributed to the increase 
the expansion of our mortgage operations has been the major contributor to the growth in loan expense 
costs associated with underwriting and processing mortgage loans at our current volume are significant 
additionally  expense related to the shipping of mortgage loan packages to secondary market investors has had an impact on postage 
occupancy plus furniture and equipment expense has increased as a result of expansion 
we currently have thirty eight offices  the majority of which we lease 
this compares with thirty two office locations in in we moved our headquarters from a twelve thousand  five hundred square foot leased building on executive boulevard in chesapeake  virginia to fifty one thousand square foot building that we purchased and renovated on crossways boulevard in chesapeake  virginia 
approximately fifteen thousand square feet of our new headquarters is leased to non company related tenants 
rental income from these tenants substantially offsets the operating costs of our new headquarters 
stationary and supplies increased as a result of an increase in the number of employees  higher production levels in our mortgage operations and expenses associated with our headquarters relocation 
professional fees increased in compare to primarily due to legal expenses related to loan collections and foreclosures 
in  we participated in a wider array of marketing and promotional activities aimed at getting the monarch name in front of a greater number of people 
this was accomplished through greater participation in  and sponsorship of  community related activities in the cities and towns within our footprint 
we continue to focus on controlling overhead expenses in relation to income growth 
our efficiency ratio  a productivity measure used to determine how well non interest expense is managed  was in and in our bank only efficiency ratio was in  compared to in a lower efficiency ratio indicates more favorable expense efficiency 
the efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing non interest expense by the sum of taxable equivalent net interest income and non interest income 
the expansion of our non interest income lines of business has negatively impacted this ratio

community banking involves making loans to and generating deposits from individuals and businesses in the markets where we have offices 
our mortgage banking services consist of originating residential loans and subsequently selling them to investors 
our mortgage banking segment is a strategic business unit that is managed separately from the community banking segment because the mortgage banking services segment appeals to different markets and  accordingly  requires different technology and marketing strategies

our review process is supported by a series of reports related to loan production  loan quality  credit concentrations  policy exceptions  loan delinquencies and non performing and potential problem loans 
we also utilize diversification in our loan portfolio as a means of managing risk 
our allowance for loan losses is to provide for losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management is responsible for determining the level of the allowance for loan losses  subject to review by our board of directors 
among other factors  we consider on a monthly basis our historical loss experience  the size and composition of our loan portfolio  the value and adequacy of collateral and guarantors  non performing credits including impaired loans and our risk rating based loan watch list  and local and national economic conditions 
the economy of our trade area is well diversified 
there are additional risks of future loan losses that cannot be precisely quantified or 
table of contents attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
since those factors include general economic trends as well as conditions affecting individual borrowers  the allowance for loan losses is an estimate 
to determine the total allowance for loan losses  we estimate the reserves needed for each class or segment of the portfolio  including loans analyzed on both  a pooled basis and individually 
our allowance for loan losses consists of amounts applicable to the following classes or segments i the commercial loan portfolio  ii the real estate loan portfolio  iii the consumer loan portfolio 
in addition  loans within these portfolios are evaluated as a group or on an individual or relationship basis and assigned a risk grade based on the underlying characteristics 
loans are pooled by risk grade within the portfolio segment  and losses are modeled utilizing metrics such as the risk rating  historical experience  other known and inherent risks  and quantitative techniques which management has determined fit the characteristics of that segment 
the commercial loan portfolio includes commercial and industrial loans which are usually secured by the assets being financed or other business assets such as accounts receivable or inventory and normally incorporate a personal guarantee  however  some short term loans may be made on an unsecured basis 
commercial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower s ability to operate profitably and prudently expand its business 
the real estate loan portfolio includes all loans secured by real estate 
this segment is further broken down into construction loans  residential family loans  home equity lines  multifamily loans  and commercial real estate loans 
construction and multifamily loans are underwritten utilizing feasibility studies  independent appraisal reviews  sensitivity analysis of absorption and lease rates and financial analysis of the developers and property owners 
construction loans are generally based upon estimates of costs and value associated with the complete project 
residential family and home equity loan originations utilize analytics to supplement the underwriting process 
commercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial loans  in addition to those of real estate loans 
these loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate 
commercial and real estate portfolio loans are evaluated on an individual or relationship basis and assigned a risk grade at the time the loan is made 
additionally  we perform periodic reviews of the loan or relationship to determine if there have been any changes in the original underwriting which would change the risk grade and or impact the borrower s ability to repay the loan 
the consumer loan portfolio includes consumer and installment loans and overdraft protection loans 
these loans  which are in relatively small loan amounts  are spread across many individual borrowers 
we utilize analytics to supplement general underwriting 
loans within the consumer class are assigned risk grades and evaluated as a pool  unless specifically identified through delinquency or other signs of credit deterioration  at which time the identified loan is individually evaluated 
additionally  loans that have been specifically identified as a credit risk due to circumstances that may affect the ability of the borrower to repay interest and or principal are analyzed on an individual basis 
adverse circumstances may include loss of repayment source  deterioration in the estimated value of collateral  elevated trends of delinquencies  and charge offs 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses monthly in order to maintain the allowance at a level that is sufficient to absorb probable credit losses 
such factors as the level and trend of interest rates and the condition of the national and local economies are also considered 
from time to time  events or economic factors may affect the loan portfolio  causing management to provide additional amounts to or release balances from the allowance for loan losses 
our allowance for loan losses is sensitive to risk ratings assigned to individually evaluated loans  economic assumptions  and delinquency trends driving statistically modeled reserves 
there are nine numerical risk grades that can be assigned to loans satisfactory watch list minimal special mention modest substandard average doubtful acceptable loss acceptable with care

we do not have any potential problem loans which have not been evaluated and disclosed at december  loans identified as special mention and substandard may or may not be classified as nonaccrual  based on current performance 
watch list loans are evaluated on an individual or relationship basis to determine if any  or all  of our loans to the borrower is at risk 
we evaluate the collectability of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual 
for additional discussion on this evaluation refer to note and note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
this evaluation includes  but is not limited to  the application of a loss factor which is arrive at by using a three year moving average look back at our historical losses 
this loss factor is multiplied by the outstanding principal within a risk grade to arrive at an overall loss estimate 
environmental factors may also be applied to a class

any unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses reflects management s attempt to ensure that the overall reserve appropriately reflects a margin for the imprecision necessarily inherent in estimates of credit losses 
the allowance is subject to regulatory examinations and determination as to adequacy 
this examination may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance in comparison to peer banks identified by regulatory agencies

we maintain an allowance for loan losses  which is available to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by the provision for losses and by recoveries from losses 
charged off loan balances are subtracted from the allowance 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is determined on a monthly basis 
various factors as defined in the previous section allowance and provision for loan losses are considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status after they are past due for days 
non performing loans include loans on which interest is no longer accrued  accruing loans that are contractually past due days or more as to principal and interest payments  and loans classified as troubled debt restructurings  and these are detailed in table total non performing loans as a percentage of total loans were and at december  and december   respectively 
there were twenty three loans totaling  in non accrual status at december  and twenty three loans at december  totaling  all of these loans have been identified as impaired according to accounting standards codification  receivables

demand deposit products are an area of focus due to their low cost 
noninterest bearing demand deposits grew an average million or in low interest  now accounts increased an average of million or 
in  we participated in the federal deposit insurance transaction account guarantee program  which provided that through december  our clients received unlimited coverage for balances in both their non interest bearing and low interest bearing deposit accounts

our money market account is a multi tiered product offering better rates at higher deposit levels 
it is a highly competitive product that offers more flexibility than time deposits with the benefit of rates comparable with short term time deposits 
money market balances have increased an average of million or in compared to we have chosen to focus on growth in our money market product in rather than growing time deposits because of their short term nature and the benefits this adds in managing maturities in our portfolio 
during  we evaluated and simplified our array of existing consumer demand products into four basic products which  we believe  offer our clients services that fit their specific needs 
in addition  we consolidated our money market products into two highly competitive products 
these changes are aimed at building client relationships rather than single accounts 
this goal has been further enhanced by price differentiation on our time deposits for clients and non clients

the stock carries a conversion feature for the stock holder for shares of our common stock  which reflects an initial conversion price of per share of common stock  subject to certain adjustments 
based upon the current market price of our common stock  this conversion feature is considered to be in the money for the stock holders of our series b noncumulative convertible perpetual preferred stock to convert their shares to shares of our common stock 
the stock also carries a conversion feature for the company that allow us to exercise our conversion right if  for trading days within any period of consecutive trading days  the closing price of our common stock exceeds of the then applicable conversion price of the series b preferred stock

our off balance sheet transactions recognized as of december  were a letter of credit to secure public funds  commitments to extent credit and standby letters of credit 
our letter of credit to secure public funds was from the federal home loan bank  and was for million at december  and million at december  commitments to extend credit and unfunded commitments under existing lines of credit amounted to million at december  and million at december   which represent legally binding agreements to lend to clients with fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being funded  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future liquidity requirements 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments we issue guaranteeing the performance of a client to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements

table of contents critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those applications of accounting principles or practices that require considerable judgment  estimation  or sensitivity analysis by management 
in the financial service industry  examples  though not an all inclusive list  of disclosures that may fall within this definition are the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  valuation of mortgage servicing rights  valuation of derivatives or securities without a readily determinable market value  and the valuation of the fair value of intangibles and goodwill 
except for the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and fair value estimations related to foreclosed real estate  we do not believe there are other practices or policies that require significant sensitivity analysis  judgments  or estimations 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change 
our critical accounting policies are listed below 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
allowance for loan losses our allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on gaap guidance which requires that losses be accrued when they have a probability of occurring and are estimable and that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
our allowance for loan losses has three basic components the formula allowance  the specific allowance and the unallocated allowance 
each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur 
the formula allowance uses a historical loss view as an indicator of future losses along with various economic factors and  as a result  could differ from the loss incurred in the future 
however  since this history is updated with the most recent loss information  the errors that might otherwise occur may be mitigated 
the specific allowance uses various techniques to arrive at an estimate of loss for specifically identified loans 
historical loss information  expected cash flows and fair value of collateral are used to estimate these losses 
the unallocated allowance captures losses whose impact on the portfolio have occurred but have yet to be recognized in either the formula or specific allowance 
the use of these values is inherently subjective  and our actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates 
fair value measurements under gaap we are permitted to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the estimation of fair value is significant to certain assets  including loans held for sale  available for sale securities  rate lock commitments  and foreclosed real estate owned 
these assets are recorded at fair value or lower of cost or fair value  as applicable 
the fair values of loans held for sale are based on commitments from investors 
the fair values of available for sale securities are based on published market or dealer quotes for similar securities 
the fair values of rate lock commitments are based on net fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements 
the fair value of foreclosed real estate owned is estimated based on our evaluation of fair value of similar properties 
fair values can be volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors  including market interest rates  prepayment speeds  discount rates  and market conditions  among others 
since these factors can change significantly and rapidly  fair values are difficult to predict and subject to material changes that could impact our financial condition and results of operation 
non gaap presentations our management s discussion and analysis refers to the efficiency ratio  which is computed by dividing non interest expense by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and non interest income 
this is a non gaap financial measure which we believe provides investors with important information regarding our operational efficiency 
comparison of our efficiency ratio with those of other companies may not be possible because other 
table of contents companies may calculate the efficiency ratio differently 
in referring to our net income  we are referring to income under gaap 
the analysis of net interest income in this document is performed on a tax equivalent basis 
we feel the tax equivalent presentation better reflects total return  as many financial assets have specific tax advantages that modify their effective yields 
a reconcilement of tax equivalent net interest income to net interest income under gaap is provided in those statements 
impact of inflation and changing prices the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore differ greatly from most industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets 
due to this fact  the effects of inflation on our balance sheet are minimal  meaning that there are no substantial increases or decreases in net purchasing power over time 
the most significant effect of inflation is on other expenses that tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
we feel that the most significant impact on financial results is changes in interest rates and our ability to react to those changes 
as discussed previously  management is attempting to measure  monitor and control interest rate risk 
impact of prospective accounting standards for discussion regarding the impact of new accounting standards  refer to recent accounting pronouncements in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates or prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of our asset liability management process  which is governed by policies established by our board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
our board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out asset liability management policies to the asset liability management committee alco 
in this capacity  this committee develops guidelines and strategies that govern our asset liability management related activities  based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates 
as interest rates change  the interest income and expense streams associated with our financial instruments also change  affecting net interest income  the primary component of our earnings 
alco uses the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
while this committee routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling month horizon  it also employs additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on our balance sheet 
the simulation model is prepared and updated four times each year 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits  which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one year horizon given a   and basis point bp upward shift or a  or basis point downward shift in interest rates 
the model does simulations using two assumptions  a sudden or shocked one month shift in rates and a ramped parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period 
the following reflects the range of our net interest income sensitivity analysis and market value of portfolio equity sensitivity as of december  all of the results in the net interest income met the approved policy limits of our asset liability management policy with the exception of the shocked assumption for a downward shift of basis points 
the results of changes in market value of portfolio equity sensitivity indicate that downward shifts of basis points under both assumptions would yield results that were not within the approved limits 
we continue to focus its efforts on complying with approved limits 

table of contents table change in net interest income and market value of portfolio equity shocked change in interest rates changes in net interest income changes in market value of portfolio equity amount percent amount percent up up up up down down ramped change in interest rates changes in net interest income changes in market value of portfolio equity amount percent amount percent up up up up down down our simulation model makes assumptions including the slope and timing of rate increases  the rates that drive certain financial instruments  prepayment assumption  etc 
represents the difference between estimated net interest income for the next months in the current rate environment 
represents the difference between market value of portfolio equity in the current interest rate environment 
at the end of  our interest rate risk model indicated that over a month period  in a rising rate environment under both a shocked and ramped simulation increases in interest rates of basis points could increase net interest income close to on average  and a basis point rate increase could increase net interest income over on average 
for the same time period the interest rate risk model indicated that in a declining rate environment of basis points under both a shocked and ramped simulations over a month period net interest income could decrease by on average 
while these numbers are subjective based upon the parameters used within the model  management believes the balance sheet is poised for improved profitability in a rising rate environment 
in our balance sheet grew by million 
deposit inflows  primarily in the form of money market accounts and demand deposit accounts have provided the funding for the growth in the loan portfolio 
overall  we continue to have moderate interest rate risk to falling interest rates 
based upon our final simulation  we could expect an average positive impact to net interest income of between  and  depending on the rate of rise  over the next months if rates increased a total of basis points 
if rates were to decline basis points  we could expect an average negative impact to net interest income of between million and million depending on the rate of decline  over the next months 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a bank forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions  including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  asset and liability growth  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment or replacement of asset and liability cash flow 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and 
table of contents local market conditions  we cannot make any assurances about the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to factors such as prepayment and refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change  caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on clients with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal and external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that our alco committee might take in response to or in anticipation of changes in interest rates
