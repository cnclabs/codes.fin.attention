overview background southwestern energy company is an independent energy company engaged in natural gas and crude oil exploration  development and production e p 
we are also focused on creating and capturing additional value through our gas gathering and marketing businesses  which we refer to as midstream services 
we have historically operated principally in three segments e p  midstream services and natural gas distribution 
on july   we closed the sale of our utility subsidiary  arkansas western gas company  or arkansas western gas  and as a result  no longer have any natural gas distribution operations 
the operating results and cash flows from arkansas western gas through june  are included in the consolidated statements of operations and statements of cash flows  as applicable  and are not presented as discontinued operations 
we refer you to note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for additional information 
our primary business is the exploration for and production of natural gas within the united states with our current operations being principally focused on development of an unconventional gas reservoir located on the arkansas side of the arkoma basin  which we refer to as the fayetteville shale play 
we are also actively engaged in exploration and production activities in texas  pennsylvania and to a lesser extent in oklahoma 
in  we commenced an exploration program in new brunswick  canada  which represents our first operations outside of the united states 
we are focused on providing long term growth in the net asset value of our business  which we achieve in our e p business through the drillbit 
we derive the vast majority of our operating income and cash flow from the natural gas production of our e p business and expect this to continue in the future 
we expect that growth in our operating income and revenues will primarily depend on natural gas prices and our ability to increase our natural gas production 
we expect our natural gas production volumes will continue to increase due to the ongoing development of our fayetteville shale play in arkansas 
the price we expect to receive for our natural gas is a critical factor in the capital investments we make in order to develop our properties and increase our production 
in recent years  there has been a significant decline in natural gas prices as evidenced by new york mercantile exchange nymex natural gas prices ranging from a high of per mcf in to a low of per mcf in natural gas prices fluctuate due to a variety of factors we cannot control or predict 
these factors  which include increased supplies of natural gas due to greater exploration and development activities  weather conditions  political and economic events  and competition from other energy sources  impact supply and demand for natural gas  which in turn determines the sale prices for our production 
in addition to the factors identified above  the prices we realize for our production are affected by our hedging activities as well as locational differences in market prices 
recent financial and operating results we reported net income attributable to southwestern energy of million in  or per diluted share  up from a net loss attributable to southwestern energy of million  or per diluted share  in the loss in included a million  or million net of taxes  non cash ceiling test impairment of our united states natural gas and oil properties that resulted from a significant decline in natural gas prices during the first quarter of we reported net income attributable to southwestern energy of million in  or per diluted share 
net income attributable to southwestern energy in included a million net of tax gain  or per diluted share  related to the sale of arkansas western gas that closed on july  our cash flow from operating activities increased to  million in due to an increase in net income adjusted for non cash expenses and changes in working capital  and increased to  million in due to an increase in net income adjusted for non cash expenses  partially offset by changes in working capital 
in  our natural gas and oil production increased to bcfe  up from bcfe in the bcfe increase in our production resulted from a bcf increase in net production from our fayetteville shale play and a bcf increase in net production from our appalachia properties  which more than offset a combined bcfe swn 
table of contents decrease in net production from our east texas and arkoma basin properties 
in  our natural gas and oil production increased to bcfe  up from bcfe in we are targeting natural gas and oil production of to bcfe  an increase of approximately to over our production 
our year end reserves grew in to  bcfe  up from  bcfe at the end of and  bcfe at the end of  primarily as a result of the continued development of our fayetteville shale play 
our e p segment reported operating income of million in  up from an operating loss of million in the operating loss in included a million non cash ceiling test impairment of our united states natural gas and oil properties 
excluding the million non cash ceiling test impairment  operating income in increased million over as a result of the revenue impact of our increase in production which was partially offset by the decline in our average realized gas prices and a million increase in operating costs and expenses that resulted from our significant production growth 
we recorded operating income from our e p segment of million for excluding the million non cash ceiling test impairment in  operating income decreased million in compared to as a result of a decline in our average realized gas prices and a million increase in operating costs and expenses that resulted from our significant production growth  which was partially offset by the revenue impact of our increase in production 
operating income for our midstream services segment was million in  up from million in and million in operating income for our midstream services segment increased in due to an increase of million in gathering revenues and an increase of million in the margin generated from our natural gas marketing activities  which were partially offset by a million increase in operating costs and expenses  exclusive of gas purchase costs  that resulted from our continued significant growth in volumes gathered 
volumes gathered grew to bcf in compared to bcf in operating income for our midstream services segment increased in due to an increase of million in gathering revenues and an increase of million in the margin generated from our natural gas marketing activities  which were partially offset by a million increase in operating costs and expenses  exclusive of gas purchase costs  that resulted from our significant growth in volumes gathered 
volumes gathered grew to bcf in compared to bcf in operating income for our natural gas distribution segment was million for the first six months in  prior to the sale of arkansas western gas 
we had total capital investments of  million in  compared to  million in and  million in of our total capital investments   million was invested in our e p segment in compared to  million and  million invested in our e p segment in and  respectively 
outlook we believe the outlook for our business is favorable despite the continued uncertainty of natural gas prices in the united states and the legislative and regulatory challenges facing our industry 
our resource base  financial strength and disciplined investment of capital provide us with an opportunity to exploit and develop our position in the fayetteville shale play  maximize efficiency through economies of scale in our key operating areas  enhance our overall returns through expansion of our midstream services operations and grow through new exploration and development activities 
our capital investment plan for is based on our expectation that natural gas prices will remain near price levels and the realized sales price for our production continues to meet our targeted return of of discounted pre tax pvi for each dollar we invest in our e p projects

we expect our natural gas production volumes to continue to increase due to the development of our fayetteville shale play 
natural gas and oil prices are difficult to predict and subject to wide price fluctuations 
as of february   we had hedged bcf of our remaining natural gas production  bcf of our natural gas production and bcf of our natural gas production to help limit our exposure to price fluctuations 
for more information about our derivatives and risk management activities  we refer you to note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k and to commodity prices below for additional information 
production in  our natural gas and oil production increased to bcfe  up from bcfe in and was produced entirely by our properties in the united states 
the bcfe increase in our production resulted from a bcf increase in net production from our fayetteville shale play and a bcf increase in net production from our appalachia properties  which more than offset a combined bcfe decrease in net production from our east texas and arkoma basin properties 
natural gas and oil production was up approximately to bcfe in  as compared to  due to a bcf increase in net production from our fayetteville shale play as a result of our ongoing development program and increases in our east texas and arkoma net production of bcfe  which more than offset decreases in net production due to the sale of our permian basin and gulf coast properties 
our net production from the fayetteville shale play was bcf in  up from bcf in and bcf in we are targeting natural gas and oil production of to bcfe  an increase of approximately to over our production 
approximately to bcf of our targeted natural gas production is projected to come from our activities in the fayetteville shale play 
although we expect production volumes in to increase  we cannot guarantee our success in discovering  developing and producing reserves  including with respect to our fayetteville shale swn 
table of contents play 
our ability to discover  develop and produce reserves is dependent upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including the availability of capital  the timing and extent of changes in natural gas and oil prices and competition 
there are also many risks inherent in the discovery  development and production of natural gas and oil 
we refer you to risk factors in item a of part i of this form k for a discussion of these risks and the impact they could have on our financial condition and results of operations 
commodity prices the average price realized for our natural gas production  including the effects of hedges  decreased to per mcf in and decreased to per mcf in the decrease in the average price realized in compared to primarily reflects the decreased effect of our natural gas price hedging activities  which had a greater positive impact on our average realized gas price in see additional discussion below 
the decrease in the average price realized in compared to primarily reflected the decrease in average market prices  which was partially offset by the positive effect of our price hedging activities in we periodically enter into various hedging and other financial arrangements with respect to a portion of our projected natural gas and crude oil production in order to ensure certain desired levels of cash flow and to minimize the impact of price fluctuations  including fluctuations in locational market differentials we refer you to item a of this form k  note to the consolidated financial statements  and our hedge risk factor for additional discussion about our derivatives and risk management activities 
our hedging activities increased the average gas price per mcf in  compared to an increase of per mcf in and a decrease of per mcf in disregarding the impact of hedges  the average price received for our natural gas production in was per mcf higher than and lower than the average monthly nymex settlement price  primarily due to locational market differentials 
during and  widening market differentials caused the difference in our annual average price received for our natural gas production to range from approximately to per mcf lower than market prices 
the discount was at its highest in late  due to increased production in the fayetteville shale for which there was not sufficient transportation to other markets as a result of the delay in the completion of the boardwalk pipeline 
since the completion of the boardwalk pipeline  the locational differences in the market prices for our natural gas production have narrowed 
assuming a nymex commodity price of per mcf for  the average price received for our natural gas production is expected to be approximately to per mcf below the nymex henry hub index price  including the impact of our basis hedges 
at december   we had basis protected on approximately bcf of our expected natural gas production through financial hedging activities and physical sales arrangements at a basis differential to nymex gas prices of approximately per mcf 
our e p segment receives a sales price for our natural gas at a discount to average monthly nymex settlement prices due to locational basis differentials  while transportation charges and fuel charges also reduce the price received 
for  we expect our total gas sales discount to nymex to be to per mcf 
in addition to the basis hedges discussed above  at december   we had nymex fixed price hedges in place on notional volumes of bcf of our remaining natural gas production at an average price of per mmbtu and collars on place on notional volumes of bcf of our natural gas production at an average floor and ceiling price of and per mmbtu  respectively 
at december   we had nymex fixed price hedges in place on notional volumes of bcf and bcf of our and natural gas production  respectively  and collars in place on notional volumes of bcf of our natural gas production 
we realized an average price of per barrel for our oil production for the year ended december   up approximately from the prior year 
the average realized price of per barrel was down from we did not hedge any of our  or oil production

table of contents expenses that resulted from our significant production growth  which was partially offset by the revenue impact of our increase in production 
operating costs and expenses lease operating expenses per mcfe for the e p segment were in  compared to in and in lease operating expenses per unit of production increased in primarily due to increased gathering  compression and water disposal costs associated with our fayetteville shale operations 
lease operating expenses per unit of production decreased in compared to primarily due to the impact that lower natural gas prices had on the cost of compressor fuel in we expect our per unit operating cost for this segment to range between and per mcfe in general and administrative expenses for the e p segment were per mcfe in  down from per mcfe in and per mcfe in the decreases in general and administrative costs per mcfe in and were due to the effects of our increased production volumes 
in total  general and administrative expenses for the e p segment were million in  million in and million in the increases in general and administrative expenses since were primarily a result of increased payroll  incentive compensation and employee related costs associated with the expansion of our e p operations due to the continued development of the fayetteville shale play 
these increases accounted for million  or  of the increase and million  or  of the increase 
we added new e p employees during compared to employees added in we expect our per unit cost for general and administrative expenses in to range between and per mcfe 
the expected increase in our per unit general and administrative costs in is due to initial development of our appalachian properties and increased compensation costs associated with ongoing development of our fayetteville shale play 
future changes in our general and administrative expenses for this segment are primarily dependent upon our salary costs  level of pension expense  amount of stock based compensation expense and the amount of incentive compensation paid to our employees 
for eligible employees  a portion of incentive compensation is based on the achievement of certain operating and performance results  including production  proved reserve additions  present value added for each dollar of capital invested  and lease operating expenses and general and administrative expenses per unit of production  while another portion is discretionary based upon an employee s performance 
taxes other than income taxes per mcfe were in both and and were in taxes other than income taxes per mcfe vary from period to period due to changes in severance and ad valorem taxes that result from the mix of our production volumes and fluctuations in commodity prices 
we recognized million  or per mcfe  in for severance tax refunds related to our east texas production  compared to million  or per mcfe  in and million  or per mcfe  in effective january   the state of arkansas increased the severance tax on natural gas wells  new discovery gas wells and gas wells that produce below a specified level 
the new severance tax rates increased the severance taxes we pay with respect to all of our production within arkansas  including our fayetteville shale operations  and impacted our results of operations by increasing taxes other than income by million  or per mcfe  in compared to our full cost pool amortization rate averaged per mcfe for  per mcfe for and per mcfe for the decline in the average amortization rate for compared to was primarily the result of lower acquisition and development costs combined with the million non cash ceiling test impairment recorded in the first quarter of and the sale of certain east texas oil and natural gas leases and wells in the second quarter of as the proceeds from the sale were appropriately credited to the full cost pool 
the decline in the average amortization rate for compared to was primarily the result of the million non cash ceiling test impairment recorded in the first quarter of as well as sales of natural gas and oil properties in  the proceeds of which were credited to the full cost pool 
the amortization rate is impacted by the timing and amount of reserve additions and the costs associated with those additions  revisions of previous reserve estimates due to both price and well performance  write downs that result from full cost ceiling tests  proceeds from the sale of properties that reduce the full cost pool and the levels of costs subject to amortization 
we cannot predict our future full cost pool amortization rate with accuracy due to the variability of each of the factors discussed above  as well as other factors  including but not limited to the uncertainty of the amount of future reserves attributed to our fayetteville shale play 
unevaluated costs excluded from amortization were million at the end of compared to million at the end of and million at the end of unevaluated costs excluded from amortization at the end of included million related to our properties in canada 
the increase in unevaluated costs since december  primarily resulted from a million increase in our undeveloped leasehold acreage and seismic costs  partially offset by a million decrease in our drilling activity in our wells in progress 
see note to the consolidated financial swn 
table of contents statements for additional information regarding our unevaluated costs excluded from amortization 
the timing and amount of production and reserve additions could have a material impact on our per unit costs  if production or reserves additions are lower than projected  our per unit costs could increase

liquidity and capital resources we depend primarily on internally generated funds  our credit facility and funds accessed through debt and equity markets as our primary sources of liquidity 
during  assuming natural gas prices remain at current levels  we expect to draw on a portion of the funds available under the credit facility to fund our planned capital investments discussed below under capital investments  which are expected to exceed the net cash generated by our operations 
we refer you to note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k and the section below under financing requirements for additional discussion of our credit facility 
net cash provided by operating activities increased to billion in  due to an increase in net income adjusted for non cash expenses and changes in working capital accounts 
net cash provided by operating activities increased to billion in  due to an increase in net income adjusted for non cash expenses which was partially offset by changes in working capital accounts 
for  requirements for our capital investments were funded from our cash generated by operating activities  borrowings under our credit facility and the proceeds from the sale of certain east texas oil and natural gas properties 
net cash from operating activities provided of our cash requirements for capital investments in  in and in at december   our capital structure consisted of debt and equity 
we believe that our operating cash flow and available funds under our credit facility will be adequate to meet our capital and operating requirements for the credit status of the financial institutions participating in our credit facility could adversely impact our ability to borrow funds under the credit facility 
while we believe all of the lenders under the facility have the ability to provide funds  we cannot predict whether each will be able to meet its obligation 
our cash flow from operating activities is highly dependent upon the market prices that we receive for our natural gas and oil production 
natural gas and oil prices are subject to wide fluctuations and are driven by market supply and demand factors which are impacted by the overall state of the economy 
the price received for our production is also influenced by our commodity hedging activities  as more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k and item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
our commodity hedging activities are subject to the credit risk of our counterparties being financially unable to complete the transaction 
we actively monitor the credit status of our counterparties  performing both quantitative and qualitative assessments based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable  and to date have not had any credit defaults associated with our transactions 
however  any future failures by one or more counterparties could negatively impact our cash flow from operating activities 
additionally  our short term cash flows are dependent on the timely collection of receivables from our customers and partners 
we actively manage this risk through credit management activities and  through the date of this filing  have not experienced any significant write offs for non collectable amounts 
however  any sustained inaccessibility of credit by our customers and partners could adversely impact our cash flows 
due to the above factors  we are unable to forecast with certainty our future level of cash flow from operations

our capital investments for are planned to be billion  consisting of billion for e p  million for midstream services and million for corporate and other purposes 
of the approximate billion  we expect to allocate approximately billion to our fayetteville shale play 
our planned level of capital investments in is expected to allow us to continue our progress in the fayetteville shale and marcellus shale programs and explore and develop other existing natural gas and oil properties and generate new drilling prospects 
as discussed above  our capital investment program is expected to be funded through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facility 
the planned capital program for is flexible and can be modified  including downward  if the low natural gas price environment persists for an extended period of time 
we will reevaluate our proposed investments as needed to take into account prevailing market conditions and  if natural gas prices change significantly in  we could change our planned investments 
financing requirements our total debt outstanding was  million at december   compared to million at december  in february  we amended and restated our unsecured revolving credit facility  increasing the borrowing capacity to billion and extending the maturity date to february the amount available under the revolving credit facility may be increased to billion at any time upon the company s agreement with its existing or additional lenders 
we had and million outstanding under its revolving credit facility at december  and december   respectively 
the interest rate on our credit facility is calculated based upon our public debt rating and is currently basis points over libor 
our publicly traded notes are rated bbb by standard and poor s and we have a corporate family rating of ba by moody s 
any downgrades in our public debt ratings could increase our cost of funds under the credit facility 
our credit facility contains covenants which impose certain restrictions on us 
under the credit facility  we must keep our total debt at or below of our total capital  and must maintain a ratio of ebitda to interest expense of or above 
our credit facility s financial covenants with respect to capitalization percentages exclude the noncontrolling interest in equity  the effects of non cash entries that result from any full cost ceiling impairments  hedging activities and our pension and other postretirement liabilities 
therefore  under our credit facility  our capital structure at december  would have been debt and equity 
we were in compliance with all of the covenants of our credit facility at december  although we do not anticipate any violations of our financial covenants  our ability to comply with those covenants is dependent upon the success of our exploration and development program and upon factors beyond our control  such as the market prices for natural gas and oil 
if we are unable to borrow under our credit facility  we would have to decrease our capital investment plans

the natural gas in inventory for the e p segment is used primarily to supplement production in meeting the segment s contractual commitments  especially during periods of colder weather 
in determining the lower of cost or market for storage gas  we utilize the natural gas futures market in assessing the price we expect to be able to realize for our natural gas in inventory 
a significant decline in the future market price of natural gas could result in additional write downs of our natural gas in underground storage carrying cost 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following describes significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
natural gas and oil properties we utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to the exploration  development and acquisition of natural gas and oil reserves 
under this method  all such costs productive and nonproductive  including salaries  benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities are capitalized on a country by country basis and amortized over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method 
these capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits such pooled costs  net of applicable deferred taxes  to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved natural gas and oil reserves discounted at percent standardized measure plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties 
any costs in excess of the ceiling are written off as a non cash expense 
swn 
table of contents the expense may not be reversed in future periods  even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling 
effective december   companies using the full cost method were required to use the average quoted price from the first day of each month from the previous months  including the impact of derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges  to calculate the ceiling value of their reserves 
for quarter and annual periods ending prior to december   prices in effect at the date of each accounting quarter  including the impact of derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges  were required to be used 
using the average quoted price from the first day of each month from the previous months for henry hub natural gas of per mmbtu and per barrel for west texas intermediate oil  adjusted for market differentials  the company s net book value of its united states natural gas and oil properties did not exceed the ceiling amount and did not result in a ceiling test impairment at december  cash flow hedges of natural gas production in place increased this ceiling amount by approximately million at december  decreases in average market prices as well as changes in production rates  levels of reserves  evaluation of costs excluded from amortization  future development costs and service costs could result in future ceiling test impairments 
at december   the ceiling value of the company s reserves was calculated based upon year end quoted market prices of per mcf for henry hub natural gas and per barrel for west texas intermediate oil  and at december   the ceiling value of the company s reserves was calculated based upon year end quoted market prices of per mcf for henry hub natural gas and per barrel for west texas intermediate oil 
decreases in market prices as well as changes in production rates  levels of reserves  evaluation of costs excluded from amortization  future development costs and production costs could result in future ceiling test impairments 
at march   the net capitalized costs of our natural gas and oil properties exceeded the ceiling by approximately million net of tax and resulted in a non cash ceiling test impairment in the first quarter of all of our costs directly associated with the acquisition and evaluation of properties in new brunswick  canada relating to our exploration program at december  were unproved and did not exceed the ceiling amount 
if our exploration program in canada is unsuccessful on all or a portion of these properties  a ceiling test impairment may result in the future 
natural gas and oil reserves cannot be measured exactly 
our estimate of natural gas and oil reserves requires extensive judgments of reservoir engineering data and projections of cost that will be incurred in developing and producing reserves and is generally less precise than other estimates made in connection with financial disclosures 
our reservoir engineers prepare our reserve estimates under the supervision of our management 
reserve estimates are prepared for each of our properties annually by the reservoir engineers assigned to the asset management team to which the property is assigned 
the reservoir engineering and financial data included in these estimates are reviewed by senior engineers who are not part of the asset management teams and our vice president ep a  who was the technical person primarily responsible for the preparation of our reserve estimates  and has over twenty years of experience in petroleum engineering  including over fifteen years in estimating oil and natural gas reserves 
on our behalf  the vice president ep a engages netherland  sewell associates  inc  or nsai  a worldwide leader of petroleum property analysis for industry and financial organizations and government agencies  to independently audit our proved reserves estimates as discussed in more detail below 
the financial data included in the reserve estimates are also separately reviewed by our accounting staff 
following these reviews and the audit  the reserve estimates are submitted to our chief executive officer for his review and approval prior to the presentation to our board of directors 
nsai reports the results of its reserve audit to the board of directors and final authority over the estimates of our proved reserves rests with our board of directors 
in each of the past three years  revisions to our proved reserve estimates represented no greater than of our total proved reserve estimates  which we believe is indicative of the effectiveness of our internal controls 
proved developed reserves generally have a higher degree of accuracy in this estimation process  when compared to proved undeveloped and proved non producing reserves  as production history and pressure data over time is available for the majority of our proved developed properties 
proved developed reserves accounted for of our total reserve base at december  assigning monetary values to such estimates does not reduce the subjectivity and changing nature of such reserve estimates 
the uncertainties inherent in the reserve estimates are compounded by applying additional estimates of the rates and timing of production and the costs that will be incurred in developing and producing the reserves 
we cannot assure you that our internal controls sufficiently address the numerous uncertainties and risks that are inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures as many factors are beyond our control 
we refer you to although our estimated natural gas and oil reserve data is independently audited  our estimates may still prove to be inaccurate in item a  risk factors  of part i of this form k for a more detailed discussion of these uncertainties  risks and other factors 
in conducting its audit  the engineers and geologists of nsai study our major properties in detail and independently develop reserve estimates 
nsai s audit consists primarily of substantive testing  which includes a detailed review of swn 
table of contents major properties that account for approximately of present worth of the company s total proved reserves 
nsai s audit process consists of sorting all fields by descending present value order and selecting the fields from highest value to descending value until the selected fields account for more than of the present worth of our reserves 
the properties in the bottom of the total present worth are not reviewed in the audit 
the fields included in approximately the top present value as of december   accounted for approximately of our total proved reserves and approximately of our proved undeveloped reserves 
in the conduct of its audit  nsai did not independently verify the data we provided to them with respect to ownership interests  oil and natural gas production  well test data  historical costs of operation and development  product prices  or any agreements relating to current and future operations of the properties and sales of production 
nsai has advised us that if  in the course of its audit  something came to its attention that brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such information or data  nsai did not rely on such information or data until it had satisfactorily resolved any questions relating thereto or had independently verified such information or data 
for the year ended december   on january   nsai issued its audit opinion as to the reasonableness of our reserve estimates  stating that our estimated proved oil and gas reserves are  in the aggregate  reasonable and have been prepared in accordance with standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers 
a decline in natural gas and oil prices used to calculate the discounted future net revenues of our reserves affects both the present value of cash flows and the quantity of reserves reported 
our reserve base is nearly natural gas  therefore changes in oil prices used do not have as significant an impact as natural gas prices on cash flows and reported reserve quantities 
our standardized measure and reserve quantities at december   were  million and  bcfe  respectively 
an assumed decrease of per mcf in the average natural gas price used to price our reserves would have resulted in an approximate  million decline in our standardized measure and an approximate decrease of bcfe of our reported reserves 
the decline in reserve quantities  assuming this decrease in natural gas price  would have the impact of increasing our unit of production amortization of the full cost pool 
the unit of production rate for amortization is adjusted quarterly based on changes in reserve estimates  capitalized costs and future development costs 
hedging we use natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil 
our policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings to minimize the risk of uncollectability 
we actively monitor the credit status of our counterparties  performing both quantitative and qualitative assessments based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable  and to date have not had any credit defaults associated with our transactions 
from through  we established a portfolio of hedges relating to approximately to of our annual production 
however  only of our production and of our production was hedged due to credit and overall market events of late and in as well as the low commodity price environment throughout and the primary market risks related to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil 
however  the market price risk is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related natural gas or oil transaction that is hedged 
our derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our financial statements and generally qualify for hedge accounting 
we have established the fair value of derivative instruments using data provided by our counterparties in conjunction with assumptions evaluated internally using established index prices and other sources 
these valuations are recognized as assets or liabilities in our balance sheet and  to the extent an open position is an effective cash flow hedge on equity production  the offset is recorded in other comprehensive income 
results of settled commodity hedging transactions are reflected in natural gas and oil sales 
any derivative not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment or any ineffective portion of a properly designated hedge is recognized immediately in earnings 
for the year ended december   we recorded an unrealized gain of million related to basis differential swaps that did not qualify for hedge accounting in addition to a million loss related to the change in estimated ineffectiveness of our commodity cash flow hedges 
future market price volatility could create significant changes to the hedge positions recorded in our financial statements 
we refer you to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item a of part ii of this form k for additional information regarding our hedging activities 
pension and other postretirement benefits we record our prepaid or accrued benefit cost  as well as our periodic benefit cost  for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans using measurement assumptions that we consider reasonable at the time of calculation see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion and disclosures regarding these benefit plans 
two of the assumptions that affect the amounts recorded are the discount rate  which estimates the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled  and the expected return on plan assets  which reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the swn 
table of contents funds invested 
for the december  benefit obligation and the periodic benefit cost to be recorded in  the discount rate assumed is 
for the periodic benefit cost  the expected return assumed is 
this compares to a discount rate of and an expected return of used in using the assumed rates discussed above  we recorded pension expense of million in related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
due to the significance of the discount rate and expected long term rate of return  the following sensitivity analysis demonstrates the effect that a basis point change in those assumptions would have had on our pension expense increase decrease of annual pension expense basis point increase basis point decrease in thousands discount rate expected long term rate of return at december   we recognized a liability of million  compared to million at december   related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
during  we also made cash payments totaling million to fund our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
in  we expect to make cash payments totaling million to fund our pension and other postretirement benefit plans and recognize pension expense of million and a postretirement benefit expense of million 
natural gas in underground storage we currently have one facility owned by our e p segment that contains natural gas in underground storage 
natural gas in storage that is expected to be cycled within the next months is recorded in current assets 
this current portion of natural gas in storage is classified as inventory and is carried at the lower of cost or market 
at december  and  the current portion of natural gas in storage was million and million  respectively 
the non current portion of natural gas in storage is classified in property and equipment and carried at cost 
the carrying value of the non current gas is evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may not be recoverable 
the natural gas in inventory for the e p segment is used primarily to supplement production in meeting the segment s contractual commitments  especially during periods of colder weather 
in determining the lower of cost or market for storage gas  we utilize the natural gas futures market in assessing the price we expect to be able to realize for our natural gas in inventory 
a significant decline in the future market price of natural gas could result in a write down of our natural gas in storage carrying cost 
new accounting standards implemented in this report on december   the company implemented certain provisions of fasb asc  extractive activities oil and gas  as updated by accounting standards update no 
 extractive activities oil and gas topic fasb asc  which a expand the definition of oil and gas producing activities  b require energy companies to value their proved reserves by averaging the price from the first day of each month from the previous months instead of using a year end price  and c allow for additional drilling locations to be classified as proved undeveloped reserves assuming such locations are supported by reliable technologies 
the company accounted for the fasb asc changes as a change in accounting principle that is inseparable from a change in accounting estimate and will account for the change prospectively 
the company is not able to disclose the effects resulting from the implementation of these changes on the amount of proved reserves and disclosed quantities because personnel and time constraints made it infeasible for the company to perform a second internal reserve estimation process under the prior standards on its approximately  properties

table of contents regulatory changes  the uncertainty inherent in estimating proved natural gas and oil reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures and the other risks described in item a of part i of this form k 
estimates of our proved natural gas and oil reserves and the estimated future net revenues from such reserves in this form k are based upon various assumptions  including assumptions required by the sec relating to natural gas and oil prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital investments  taxes and availability of funds 
the process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is complex 
this process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
therefore  those estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  natural gas and oil prices  revenues  taxes  development investments  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas and oil reserves will most likely vary from those estimated 
such variances may be material 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves set forth in this form k 
our properties may also be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by other operators on adjacent properties 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing natural gas and oil prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
at december   approximately of our estimated proved reserves were proved undeveloped and were proved developed non producing 
proved undeveloped reserves and proved developed non producing reserves  by their nature  are less certain than proved developed producing reserves 
estimates of reserves in the non producing categories are nearly always based on volumetric calculations rather than the performance data used to estimate producing reserves 
recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
recovery of proved developed non producing reserves requires capital expenditures to recomplete into the zones behind pipe and is subject to the risk of a successful recompletion 
production revenues from proved undeveloped and proved developed non producing reserves will not be realized  if at all  until sometime in the future 
the reserve data assumes that we will make significant capital investments to develop our reserves 
although we have prepared estimates of our natural gas and oil reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with industry standards  we cannot assure you that the estimated costs are accurate  that development will occur as scheduled or that the actual results will be as estimated 
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows referred to in this form k is the current fair value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on average prices over the preceding twelve months and costs as of the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the average prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
any changes in consumption by gas purchasers or in governmental regulations or taxation could also affect actual future net cash flows 
the timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of natural gas and oil properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value 
in addition  the discount factor  which is required by the sec to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most accurate discount factor for our company 
should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described above or elsewhere in this form k occur  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  our actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements 
we specifically disclaim all responsibility to publicly update any information contained in a forward looking statement or any forward looking statement in its entirety and therefore disclaim any resulting liability for potentially related damages

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from the volatility in commodity prices  basis differentials and interest rates  as well as credit risk concentrations 
we use natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options and interest rate swaps to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil and in interest rates 
our board of directors has approved risk management policies and procedures to utilize financial products for the reduction of defined commodity price risk 
utilization of financial products for the reduction of interest rate risks is subject to the approval of our board of directors 
these policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings 
credit risk our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of trade receivables and derivative contracts associated with commodities trading 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of our customers and their dispersion across geographic areas 
no single customer accounted for greater than of revenues at december  see commodities risk below for discussion of credit risk associated with commodities trading 
interest rate risk the following table presents the principal cash payments for our debt obligations and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates as of december  at december   we had  million of total debt with a weighted average interest rate of and we had million of indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility

commodities risk we use over the counter natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options to hedge sales of our production and to hedge activity in our midstream services segment against the inherent price risks of adverse price fluctuations or locational pricing differences between a published index and the nymex futures market 
these swaps and options include transactions in which one party will pay a fixed price or variable price for a notional quantity in exchange for receiving a variable price or fixed price based on a published index referred to as price swaps  transactions in which parties agree to pay a price based on two different indices referred to as basis swaps and the purchase and sale of index related puts and calls collars that provide a floor price  below which the counterparty pays funds equal to the amount by which the price of the commodity is below the contracted floor  and a ceiling price above which we pay to the counterparty the amount by which the price of the commodity is above the contracted ceiling 
the primary market risks relating to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil 
however  the market price risk is offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related sale or purchase of the natural gas or sale of the oil that is hedged 
credit risk relates to the risk of loss as a result of non performance by our counterparties 
the counterparties are primarily major commercial banks  investment banks  and integrated energy companies which management believes present minimal credit risks 
the credit quality of each counterparty and the level of financial exposure we have to each counterparty are closely monitored to limit our credit risk exposure 
additionally  we perform both quantitative and qualitative assessments of these counterparties based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable 
we have not incurred any counterparty losses related to non swn

changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are recorded in gas and oil sales 
at december   we had outstanding fixed price basis differential swaps on bcf of natural gas production 
for the year ended december   we recorded an unrealized gain of million related to the differential swaps that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and a loss of million related to the change in estimated ineffectiveness of our cash flow hedges 
typically  our hedge ineffectiveness results from changes at the end of a reporting period in the price differentials between the index price of the derivative contract  which is primarily a nymex price  and the index price for the point of sale for the cash flow that is being hedged 
at december   we had outstanding fixed price basis differential swaps on bcf of and bcf of natural gas production that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
subsequent to december  and prior to february   we hedged an additional bcf of natural gas production using fixed price swaps at an average price of per mmbtu  bcf of natural gas production at an average price of per mmbtu and bcf of natural gas production at an average price of per mmbtu
