item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   overview healthcare reform impacts 
future rulemaking could increase rebates  reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services  or require additional reporting and disclosure 
we cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking 
due to extensive regulation and enforcement in the pharmaceutical industry  we face significant uncertainties and potentially significant costs associated with our efforts to comply with applicable regulations 
failure to comply could result in material adverse effects to our business  financial position and results of operations  and the market value of our common stock could decline 
the pharmaceutical industry is subject to regulation by various governmental authorities at the federal  state and local levels with respect to the development  manufacture  labeling  sale  distribution  marketing  advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products 
failure to comply with governmental regulations can result in fines  disgorgement of profits  unanticipated compliance expenditures  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production and or distribution  suspension of the fda s review of ndas or andas  enforcement actions  injunctions and criminal prosecution 
although we have developed compliance programs to address the regulatory environment  there is no guarantee that these programs will meet regulatory agency standards now or in the future 
additionally  despite our efforts at compliance  there is no guarantee that we may not be deemed to be deficient in some manner in the future 
if we are deemed to be deficient in any significant way  our business  financial position and results of operations could be materially affected  and the m arket value of our common stock could decline 
our brand pharmaceutical expenditures may not result in commercially successful products 
commercializing brand pharmaceutical products is more costly than generic products 
we have made significant investments in the development of the brand segment of our business  strativa pharmaceuticals 
this has led to increased infrastructure costs 
we cannot be certain that these business expenditures will result in the successful development or launch of brand products that will prove to be commercially successful or will improve the long term profitability of our business 
just as we compete against companies selling branded products when we sell generic products  we will confront the same competitive pres sures from other generic pharmaceutical companies when we sell our branded products 
specifically  generic products are generally sold at a significantly lower cost than the branded version  and  where available  may be required or encouraged in preference to the branded version under third party reimbursement programs  or substituted by pharmacies for branded versions by law 
competition from generic equivalents  accordingly  could have an adverse effect on our strativa segment 
we continue to consider product or business acquisitions or licensing arrangements to expand our brand product line 
any growth of the strativa segment will be based largely on the successful commercializati on of our existing products and the acquisition or in licensing of new product opportunities 
our current and future investments in acquisition or license arrangements may not lead to expected  adequate or any returns on investment 
for example  in and  we invested in license arrangements for five products under development  and the development programs for two of the five have been terminated unsuccessfully pafuramidine maleate as of february and onconase as of september 
additionally  a third product under development zensana tm did not achieve bioequivalence to the reference drug in all studies in in addition  we also may not be able to execute future license agreements on reasonable or favorable terms in order to continue to grow or sustain our brand business segment 
strativa relaunched nascobal in the second quarter of  launched oravig tm in the third quarter of and launched zuplenz in the fourth quarter of we cannot be certain that our brand product expenditures will result in commercially successful launches of these products or will improve the long term profitability of strativa 
to the extent that any of these launches do not meet current expectations  we may be required to write down assets specifically related to these products 
we expend a significant amount of resources on research and development  including milestones on in licensed products  which may not lead to successful product introductions 
much of our development effort is focused on technically difficult to formulate products and or products that require advanced manufacturing technology 
we expend resources on research a nd development primarily to enable us to manufacture and market fda approved pharmaceuticals in accordance with fda regulations 
typically  research expenses related to the development of innovative compounds and the filing of ndas are significantly greater than those expenses associated with andas 
we have entered into  and may in the future enter into  additional agreements that require us to make significant milestone payments upon achievement of various research and development events and regulatory approvals 
as we continue to develop and in license new products  we will likely incur increased research and licensing expenses 
because of the inherent risk associated with research and development efforts in the industry  particularly with respect to new drugs  our research and development expenditures may not result in the successful introduction of fda approved new pharmaceutical products 
also  after we or our development partner s submit an anda or nda  the fda may request that we conduct additional studies 
as a result  we may be unable to reasonably determine the total research and development costs required to develop a particular product 
finally  we cannot be certain that any investment made in developing products will be recovered  even if we are successful in commercialization 
to the extent that we expend significant resources on research and development efforts and are not ultimately able to introduce successful new products as a result of those efforts  our business  financial position and results of operations may be materially adversely affected  and the market value of our common stock could decline 
the testing required for the regulatory approval of our products is conducted by independent third parties 
any failure by any of these third parties to perform this testing properly and in a timely manner may have an adverse effe ct upon our ability to obtain regulatory approvals 
our applications for the regulatory approval of our products  including in licensed products  incorporate the results of testing and other information that is conducted or gathered by independent third parties including  for example  manufacturers of raw materials  testing laboratories  contract research organizations or independent research facilities 
our ability to obtain regulatory approval of the products being tested is dependent upon the quality of the work performed by these third parties  the quality of the third parties facilities  and the accuracy of the information provided by third parties 
we have little or no control over any of these factors 
if this testing is not performed properly  our ability to obtain regulatory approvals could be restricted or delayed 
we may make acquisitions of  or investments in  complementary businesses or products  which may be on terms that are not commercially advantageous  may require additional debt or equity financing  and may involve numerous risks  including the risks that we may be unable to integrate the acquired business successfully and that we may assume liabilities that adversely affect us 
we regularly review the potential acquisition of technologies  products  product rights and complementary businesses 
we may choose to enter into such transactions at any time 
nonetheless  we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates 
to the extent that we do identify candidates that we believe to be suitable  we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to make such acquisitions or investments on commercially advantageous terms or at all 
if we make any acquisitions or investments  we may finance such acquisitions or investments through our cash reserves  debt financing  or by issuing additional equity securities  which could dilute the holdings of our then existing stockholders 
if we require financing  we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain required financing when needed on acceptable terms or at all 
any such acquisitions or investments could also result in an increase in goodwill  intangible assets and amortization expenses that could ultimately negatively impact our profitability 
if the fair value of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined at some future date to be less than its recorded value  a charge to earnings may be required 
such a charge could be in an amount that is material to our results of operations and net worth 
additionally  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in assimilating the personnel  operations and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
there may be overlap between our products or customers and those of an acquired entity that may create conflicts in relationships or other commitments detrimental to the integrated businesses 
as a result of acquiring businesses  we may incur significant transaction costs  including substantial fees for investment bankers  attorneys  accountants and financial printing 
any acquisition could result in our assumption of unknown and or unexpected  perhaps material liabilities 
a dditionally  in any acquisition agreement  the negotiated representations  warranties and agreements of the selling parties may not entirely protect us  and liabilities resulting from any breaches could exceed negotiated indemnity limitations 
a significant number of our products are produced at one location that could experience business interruptions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
we produce all of our internally manufactured products at a single manufacturing facility 
a significant disruption at that facility  even on a short term basis  could impair our ability to produce and ship products to the market on a timely basis  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
we may experience declines in the sales volume and prices of our products as a result of the continuing trend of consolidation of certain customer groups  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
we make a significant amount of our sales to a relatively small number of drug wholesalers and retail drug chains 
these customers represent an essential part of the distribution chain of our pharmaceutical products 
drug wholesalers and retail drug chains have undergone  and are continuing to undergo  significant consolidation 
this consolidation may result in these groups gaining additional purchasing leverage and consequently increasing the product pricing pressures facing our business 
additionally  the emergence of large buying groups representing independent retail pharmacies and other drug distributors  and the prevalence and influence of mana ged care organizations and similar institutions  potentially enable those groups to demand larger price discounts on our products 
the result of these developments may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
we may experience significant inventory losses related to at risk product launches  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
there are situations in which we may make business and legal judgments to market and sell products that are subject to claims of alleged patent infringement prior to final resolution of those claims by the courts  based upon our belief that such patents are invalid  unenforceable  or would not be infringed by our marketing and sale of such products 
this is referred to in the pharmaceutical industry as an at risk launch 
the risk involved in an at risk launch can be substantial because  if a patent holder ultimately prevails against us  the remedies available to such holder may include  among other things  damages measured by the profits lost by the patent holder  which can be significantly higher than the profits we make from selling the generic version of the product 
we could face substantial damages from such adverse court decisions 
we could also be at risk for the value of such inventory that we are unable to market or sell 
our operating results are affected by many factors and may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
our operating results may vary substantially from quarter to quarter 
revenues for any given period may be greater or less than revenues in the imme diately preceding period or in the comparable period of the prior year 
factors that may cause quarterly results to vary include  but are not limited to  the following the amount of new product introductions  losses related to inventory write offs prior to product launch  marketing exclusivity  if any  which may be obtained on certain new products  the level of competition in the marketplace for certain products  our ability to create demand in the marketplace for our branded products  availability of raw materials and finished products from suppliers  our ability to internally manufacture products at our manufacturing facility  the scope and outcome of governmental regulatory actions  the dependence on a small number of products for a significant portion of net revenue or income  legal actions against our generic products brought by brand competitors  and legal challenges to our intellectual property rights brought against our brand products by generic competitors  price erosion and customer consolidation  and significant payments such as milestones payable by us under collaboration  licensing  and development agreements to our partners before the related product has received fda approval 
the profitability of our product sales is also dependent upon the prices we are able to charge for our products  the costs to purchase products from third parties  and our ability to manufacture our products in a cost effective manner 
if our revenues decline or do not grow as anticipated  we may not be able to reduce our operating expenses to offset such declines 
failure to achieve anticipated levels of revenues could  therefore  significantly harm our operating results for a particular fiscal period 
in certain circumstances  we issue price adjustments and other sales allowances to our customers 
although we establish reserves based on our estimates of these amounts  if estimates are incorrect and the reserves are inadequate  it may result in adjustments to these reserves that may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
as described above  the first company to file an anda containing a paragraph iv certification that successfully challenges the patent s on a brand product may be granted days of generic market exclusivity by the fda for that generic product 
at the expiration of such exclusivity period  other generic distributors may enter the market  resulting in a significant price decline for the drug in some instances  price declines have exceeded 
when we experience price declines following a period of generi c marketing exclusivity  we may at our discretion provide price adjustments to our customers for the difference between our new lower price and the price at which we previously sold the product which is still held in inventory by our customers 
there are also circumstances under which we may decide not to provide price adjustments to certain customers  and consequently  as a matter of business strategy  we may risk a greater level of sale returns of products in the customer s existing inventory and lose future sales volume to competitors rather than reduce our pricing 
we establish reserves for chargebacks  rebates and incentives  other sales allowances  and product returns at the time of sale  based on estimates 
although we believe our reserves are adequate as of the date of this report  we cannot provide assurances that our reserves will ultimately prove to be adequate 
increases in sales allowances may exceed our estimates due to a var iety of reasons  including unanticipated competition or an unexpected change in one or more of our contractual relationships 
we will continue to evaluate the effects of competition and will record a price adjustment reserve if and when we deem it necessary 
any failure to establish adequate reserves with respect to sales allowances may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we are subject to pending litigations in connection with the restatement of certain of our financial statements for prior periods that will likely divert substantial amounts of management time from our operations and could result in significant expense and liabilities 
we and certain of our former executive officers have been named as defendants in several purported stockholder class action lawsuits filed on behalf of purchase rs of our common stock between april  and july  the lawsuits followed our july  announcement regarding the restatement of certain of our financial statements and allege that we and certain members of our then management engaged in violations of the securities exchange act of  as amended  by issuing false and misleading statements concerning our financial condition and results of operations 
we intend  and each of the individuals named as a defendant has stated an intention  to vigorously defend against these allegations 
the outcome and consequences of these actions are inherently uncertain 
such litigation is often costly and time consuming  and could result in an adverse impact on our business  results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
the defense of any such action or investigation will likely cause the diversion of management s attention and resources  and we may be required to pay damages if any such proceedings are not resolved in our favor 
further  any litigation or regulatory proceedings  even if resolved in our favor  could cause us to incur significant legal and other expenses  including modifying or adopting new controls and procedures 
such events could harm our business  affect our ability to raise capital  and adversely affect the trading price of our securities 
if we fail to maintain our internal controls over financial reporting  current stockholders and potential investors could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which would harm our business prospects and the trading price of our stock 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to e valuate the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of each fiscal reporting period 
management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of december  however  failure to maintain the existing effective control structure could impact our evaluations in future periods 
we have had a recent history of material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting as identified in and annual reports on form k 
if we fail to maintain our improvements in internal controls over financial reporting  we could fail to meet our reporting obligations  including by issuing financial statements in future periods that contain errors 
the failure to maintain our improvements in internal controls over financial reporting also could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and possibly have a negative impa ct on the trading price of our securities and could lead to additional litigation claims and or regulatory proceedings against us 
the defense of any such claims or proceedings may cause the diversion of management s attention and resources  and we may be required to pay damages if any such claims or proceedings are not resolved in our favor 
any litigation or regulatory proceeding  even if resolved in our favor  could cause us to incur significant legal and other expenses 
such events could harm our business  negatively affect our ability to raise capital and adversely affect the trading price of our securities 
risks common to our industry litigation is common in our industry  can be protracted and expensive  and could delay and or prevent entry of our products into the market  which could have a material adverse effect on our b usiness 
litigation concerning patents and branded rights can be protracted and expensive 
pharmaceutical companies with patented brand products frequently sue companies that produce generic equivalents of their patented brand name products for alleged patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights  which may delay or prevent the entry of such generic products into the market 
generally  a generic drug may not be marketed until the applicable patents on the brand name drug expire or is held to be not infringed  invalid  or unenforceable 
when we or our development partners submit an anda to the fda for approval of a generic drug  we and or our development partners must certify either that there is no patent listed by the fda as covering the relevant brand product  that any patent listed as covering the brand product has expired  that the patent listed as c overing the brand product will expire prior to the marketing of the generic product  in which case the anda will not be finally approved by the fda until the expiration of such patent  or that any patent listed as covering the brand drug is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture  sale or use of the generic product for which the anda is submitted 
under any circumstance in which an act of infringement is alleged to occur  there is a risk that a brand pharmaceutical company may sue us for alleged patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights 
also  competing pharmaceutical companies may file lawsuits against us or our strategic partners alleging patent infringement or may file declaratory judgment actions of non infringement  invalidity  or unenforceability against us relating to our own patents 
because substantially all of our current business involves the marketing and development of products that are either subject to the protection of our o wn patents or the potential assertion of claims by third parties  the threat of litigation  the outcome of which is inherently uncertain  is always present 
such litigation is often costly and time consuming and could result in a substantial delay in  or prevent  the introduction and or marketing of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  condition financial and other  prospects and results of operations 
our development partners are also parties to several lawsuits  the outcome of which may have a material impact on our business 
for more information on our material pending litigation  please see item legal proceedings of this annual report on form k 
we are susceptible to product liability claims that may not be covered by insurance  which  if successful  could require us to pay substantial sums 
like all pharmaceutical companies  we face the risk of loss resulting from  and the adverse publicity associated with  product liability lawsuits  whether or not such claims are valid 
we likely cannot avoid such claims 
unanticipated side effects or unfavorable publicity concerning any of our products would likely have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve acceptance by prescribing physicians  managed care providers  pharmacies and other retailers  customers and patients 
even unsuccessful product liability claims could require us to spend money on litigation  divert management s time  damage our reputation and impair the marketability of our products 
in addition  although we believe that we have adequate product liability insurance coverage  we cannot be certain that our insurance will  in fact  be sufficient to cover such claims or that we will be able to obtain or maintain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable prices 
a successful product liability claim that is excluded from coverage or exceeds our policy limits could require us to pay substantial sums 
in addition  insurance coverage for product liability may become prohibitively expensive in the future  and as a result we may not be able to maintain adequate product liability insurance coverage to mitigate the risk of large claims  or we may be required to maintain a larger self insured retention than we would otherwise choose to 
we are subject to extensive governmental regulation  and any non compliance may result in fines and or other sanctions  including product seizures  product recalls  injunctive actions and criminal prosecutions 
as a pharmaceutical manufacturer and distributor  we are subject to extensive regulation by the federal government  principally the fda and the drug enforcement administration  as well as by state governments 
the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  the controlled substances act  the generic drug enforcement act of the generic drug act  and other federal statutes and regulations govern the testing  manufacture  safety  labeling  storage  recordkeeping  approval  advertising and promotion including to the healthcare community of our products 
the generic drug act  a result of legislative hearings and investigations into the generic drug approval process  is particularly relevant to our business 
under the generic drug act  the fda is authorized to impose debarment and other penalties on individuals and companies that commit illegal acts relating to the generic drug approval process 
in some situations  the generic drug act requires the fda not to accept or review for a period of time any andas submitted by a company that has committed certain violations and provides for temporary denial of approval of such andas during its investigation 
additionally  non compliance with other applicable regulatory requirements may result in fines  perhaps significant in amount  and other sanctions imposed by courts and or regulatory bodies  including the initiation of product seizures  product recalls  injunctive actions and criminal prosecutions 
from time to time  we have voluntarily recalled our products 
in addition  administrative remedies may involve the refusal of the government to enter into supply contracts with  and or to approve new drug applications of  a non complying entity 
the fda also has the authority to withdraw its approval of drugs in accordance with statutory procedures 
because of the chemical ingredients of pharmaceutical products and the nature of the manufacturing process  the pharmaceutical industry is subject to extensive environmental regulation and the risk of incurring liability for damages and or the costs of remedying environmental problems 
in the future  we may be required to increase expenditures in order to remedy environmental problems and or comply with applicable regulations 
additionally  if we fail to comply with environmental regulations to use  discharge or dispose of hazardous materials appropriately or otherwise to comply with the provisions of our operating licenses  the licenses could be revoked  and we could be subject to criminal sanctions and or substantial civil liability or be required to suspend or modify our manufacturing operations 
we operate in new jersey and new york  which are states often recognized for having very aggressive public health and environmental protection laws 
finally  as part of the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of  companies are now required to file with the federal trade commission ftc and the department of justice doj certain types of agreements entered into between brand and generic pharmaceutical companies related to the manufacture  marketing and sale of generic versions of brand drugs 
this requirement could affect the manner in which generic drug manufacturers resolve intellectual property litigation and other disputes with brand pharmaceutical companies and could result generally in an increase in private party litigation against pharmaceutical companies or additional investigations or proceedings by the ftc or other governmental authorities 
the impact of this requirement  and the potential private party lawsuits associated with arrangements between brand name and generic drug manufacturers  is uncertain and could adversely affect our business 
for example  on january   the ftc filed a lawsuit against us alleging violations of antitrus t laws stemming from our court approved settlement of a patent litigation with solvay pharmaceuticals 
on february   the court granted our motion to dismiss the ftc s claims 
we believe we have complied with all applicable laws in connection with the court approved settlement and intend to continue to vigorously defend this action 
for more information on our material pending litigation  please see item legal proceedings of this annual report on form k 
investigations of the calculation of average wholesale prices may adversely affect our business 
many government and third party payors  including medicare  medicaid  hmos and others  reimburse doctors and others for the purchase of certain prescription drugs based on a drug s average wholesale price awp 
in the past several years  state and federal government agencies have conducted ongoing investigations of manufacturers reporting practices with respect to awp  in which the agencies have suggested that reporting of inflated awps by manufacturers have led to excessive payments for prescription drugs 
for example  beginning in september  we  along with numerous other pharmaceutical companies  have been named as a defendant in actions brought by state attorneys general and a number of municipal bodies within the state of new york  as well as a federal qui tam action brought on behalf of the united states by the pharmacy ven a care of the florida keys  inc ven a care alleging generally that the defendants defrauded the state medicaid systems by purportedly reporting awp and or wholesale acquisition costs that exceeded the actual selling price of the defendants prescription drugs 
to date  we have been named as a defendant in substantially similar civil law suits filed by the attorneys general of alabama  alaska  florida  hawaii  idaho  illinois  iowa  kansas  kentucky  louisiana  massachusetts  mississippi  south carolina  texas and utah  and also by the city of new york  counties across new york state and ven a care 
during  we settled the hawaii suit for million and the massachusetts suit for million  in january  we settled the alabama suit for million 
in addition  at various times between and  the attorneys general of florida  indiana and virginia and the united states office of personnel management issued subpoenas to us  and the attorneys general of michigan  tennessee  texas  and utah issued civil investigative demands to us 
certain of the other pharmaceutical companies named in these suits have ente red into settlements with various jurisdictions for amounts ranging up to tens of millions of dollars 
these actions  if successful  could adversely affect us and may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees and consultants 
our future success depends  to a substantial degree  upon the continued service of the key members of our management team 
the loss of the services of key members of our management team  or their inability to perform services on our behalf  could have a material adverse effect on our business  condition financial and other  prospects and results of operations 
our success also depends  to a large extent  upon t he contributions of our sales  marketing  scientific and quality assurance staff 
we compete for qualified personnel against other brand pharmaceutical manufacturers  as well as other generic pharmaceutical manufacturers  who may offer more favorable employment opportunities 
if we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives  we could experience constraints that would adversely affect our ability to sell and market our products effectively  to meet the demands of our strategic partners in a timely fashion  and to support research and development programs 
in particular  sales and marketing efforts depend on the ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced sales  marketing and quality assurance representatives 
although we believe that we have been successful in attracting and retaining skilled personnel in all areas of our business  we cannot provide assurance that we can continue to attract  train and retain such personnel 
any failure in this regard could limit the rates at which we generate sales and develop or acquire new products 
the raw materials essential to our manufacturing business are purchased primarily from distributors of bulk pharmaceutical chemicals manufactured by foreign companies 
any significant supply interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business  condition financial and other  prospects and results of operation 
the raw materials essential to our manufacturing business are purchased primarily from us distributors of bulk pharmaceutical chemicals manufactured by foreign companies 
if we experience supply interruptions or delays  we may have to obtain substitute materials or products  which in turn would require us to obtain amended or additional regulatory approvals  subjecting us to additional expenditures of ti me and resources 
in addition  changes in our raw material suppliers could result in significant delays in production  higher raw material costs and loss of sales and customers  because regulatory authorities must generally approve raw material sources for pharmaceutical products  which may be time consuming 
any significant supply interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business  condition financial and other  prospects and results of operation 
we depend on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights 
we cannot be certain of our ability to keep confidential and protect such rights 
our success depends on our ability to protect and defend the intellectual property rights associated with our current and future products 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property adequately  competito rs may manufacture and market products similar to  or that may be confused with  our products  and our generic competitors may obtain regulatory approval to make and distribute generic versions of our branded products 
some patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy or not published until the resulting patents issue 
because the publication of discoveries or inventions tends to follow their actual discovery or invention by several months  we cannot be certain that we were the first to invent and reduce to practice any of our discoveries or inventions 
we also cannot be certain that patents will be issued with respect to any of our patent applications or that any existing or future patents issued to or licensed by us will provide competitive advantages for our products or will not be challenged  invalidated  circumvented or held unenforceable in proceedings commenced by our competitors 
fu rthermore  our patent rights may not prevent or limit our present and future competitors from developing  making  importing  using or commercializing products that are functionally similar to our products 
we rely particularly on trade secrets  trademarks  unpatented proprietary expertise and continuing innovation that we seek to protect  in part  by registering and using marks  and  with regard to other intellectual property  by entering into confidentiality agreements with licensees  suppliers  employees  consultants and other parties 
this is done in large part because few of our products are protected by patents 
we cannot provide assurance that these agreements will not be breached or circumvented 
we also cannot be certain that we will have recourse to adequate remedies in the event of a breach 
disputes may arise concerning the ownership of intellectual property or the applicability of confidentiality agre ements 
we cannot be sure that our trade secrets and proprietary technology will not be independently developed or otherwise become known by our competitors or  if patents are not issued with respect to internally developed products  that we will be able to maintain the confidentiality of information relating to these products 
in addition  efforts to ensure our intellectual property rights can be costly  time consuming and or ultimately unsuccessful 
our stock price is volatile  and the value of your investment could decline 
the market prices for securities of pharmaceutical companies like ours have been and are likely to continue to be highly volatile 
as a result  investors in these companies often buy at high prices only to see the prices drop substantially later  resulting in an extreme drop in value in the holdings of these investors 
factors such as announcements of fluctuations in our or our competitors operating results  changes in our prospects  and general market conditions for pharmaceutical stocks  could have a significant impact on the future trading prices of our common stock 
in particular  the trading price of the common stock of many pharmaceutical companies  including ours  has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have at times been unrelated to the operating performance of the companies whose stocks were affected 
some of the factors that may cause volatility in the price of our securities include the timing of new product introd uctions  quarterly variations in results  clinical trial results and outcomes of other product development activities  regulatory developments  competition  including both brand and generic  business and product market cycles   changes in governmental regulations or legislation affecting our industry  fluctuations in customer requirements  the availability and utilization of manufacturing capacity  the timing and amounts of royalties paid to us by  or owed by us to  third parties  the availability of working capital  the outcomes of audits by regulatory agencies like the irs or the outcomes of investigations by federal authorities like the department of justice  issues with the safety or effectiveness of our products  and developments in pending litigation matters or new litigation matters 
the price of our common stock may also be adversely affected by the estimates and projections of the investment community  general economic and market conditions  and the cost of operations in our product markets 
these factors  individually or in the aggregate  could result in significant variations in the trading prices of our common stock 
volatilit y in the trading prices of our common stock could result in additional securities class action litigations 
any litigation would likely result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources

overview the introduction of new products at selling prices that generate adequate gross margins is critical to our ability to generate economic value and ultimately the creation of adequate returns for our stockholders 
par pharmaceutical  our generic products division  creates economic value by o ptimizing our current generic product portfolio and our pipeline of potential high value first to file and first to market generic products 
par pharmaceutical is an attractive business partner because of its strong commercialization track record and presence in the generic trade 
par s achievements included several launches generic versions of zegerid  tussionex  accolate  the filing of eight andas in conjunction with its development partners  and execution of several collaboration agreements to sustain the future generic pipeline 
as a result  we believe we are well positioned to compete in the generic marketplace over the long term 
our internal research and development targets high value  first to file paragraph ivs or first to market product opportunities 
externally  we intend to concentrate on acquiring assets and or partnering with technology based companies that can deliver similar product opportunities 
as of december  we had confirmed first to files and three potential first to market product opportunities 
generally  products that we have developed internally contribute higher gross margin percentages than products that we sell under supply and distribution agreements  because under such agreements  we typically pay a percentage of the gross or net profits or a percentage of sales to our strategic partners 
to continue the development of our branded products division  strativa pharmaceuticals  we acquired the worldwide rights to nascobal on march  nascobal is an fda approved prescription vitamin b treatment indicated for maintenance of remission in certain pernicious anemia patients  as well as a supplement for a variety of b deficiencies 
it is the first and currently only once weekly  self administered alternative to b injections 
n bsp  strativa also launched two products in zuplenz  which is an oral soluble film formulation of ondansetron for the prevention of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting  prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with radiotherapy  and prevention of post operative nausea and vomiting  and oravig tm  which is an antifungal therapy for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis  an opportunistic infection commonly found in immunocompromised patients  including those with hiv and cancer 
sales and gross margins of our products depend principally on i the introduction of other generic and brand products in direct competition with our products  ii the ability of generic competitors to quickly enter the market after our relevant patent or exclusivity periods expire  or during our exclusivity periods with authorized generic products  diminishing the amount and duration of significant profits we gen erate from any one product  iii the pricing practices of competitors and the removal of competing products from the market  iv the continuation of our existing license  supply and distribution agreements and our ability to enter into new agreements  v the consolidation among distribution outlets through mergers  acquisitions and the formation of buying groups  vi the willingness of generic drug customers  including wholesale and retail customers  to switch among drugs of different generic pharmaceutical manufacturers  vii our ability to procure approval of andas and ndas and the timing and success of our future new product launches  viii our ability to obtain marketing exclusivity periods for our generic products  ix our ability to maintain patent protection of our brand products  x the extent of market penetration for our existing product line  xi customer satisfaction with the level  quality and amount of our customer service  and xii th e market acceptance of our recently introduced branded products nascobal  oravig tm  zuplenz and the successful development and commercialization of our future in licensed branded product pipeline 
net sales and gross margins derived from generic pharmaceutical products often follow a pattern based on regulatory and competitive factors that we believe to be unique to the generic pharmaceutical industry 
as the patent s for a brand name product and the related exclusivity period s expire  the first generic manufacturer to receive regulatory approval from the fda for a generic equivalent of the product is often able to capture a substantial share of the market 
at that time  however  the branded company may license the right to distribute an authorized generic product to a competing generic company 
as additional generic manufacturers receive regu latory approvals for competing products  the market share and the price of those products have typically declined often significantly depending on several factors  including the number of competitors  the price of the brand product and the pricing strategy of the new competitors 
net sales and gross margins derived from brand pharmaceutical products typically follow a different pattern 
sellers of brand pharmaceutical products benefit from years of being the exclusive supplier to the market due to patent protections for the brand products 
the benefits include significantly higher gross margins relative to sellers of generic pharmaceutical products 
however  commercializing brand pharmaceutical products is more costly than generic pharmaceutical products 
sellers of brand pharmaceutical products often have increased infrastructure costs relative to sellers of generic pharmaceutical products and make significant in vestments in the development and or licensing of these products without a guarantee that these expenditures will result in the successful development or launch of brand products that will prove to be commercially successful 
selling brand products also tends to require greater sales and marketing expenses to create a market for the products than is necessary with respect to the sale of generic products 
just as we compete against companies selling branded products when we sell generic products  we confront the same competitive pressures when we sell our branded products 
specifically  after patent protections expire  generic products can be sold in the market at a significantly lower price than the branded version  and  where available  may be require d or encouraged in preference to the branded version under third party reimbursement programs  or substituted by pharmacies for branded versions by law 
healthcare reform impacts on march   president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca and on march   president obama signed into law the health care and education reconciliation act  which includes a number of changes to the ppaca 
these laws are hereafter referred to as healthcare reform or the acts 
a number of provisions of healthcare reform have had and will continue to have a negative impact on the price of our products sold to us government entities 
the significant provisions that impacted our net revenues  gross margin and net income include  but are no t limited to the following all items were effective january  unless otherwise noted increase in the medicaid rebate rate 
the base rebate rate on sales of branded drugs strativa and authorized generics par into the medicaid channel was retroactively increased from of amp average manufacturer price to of amp 
the base rebate on sales of multisource generic products par into the medicaid channel was retroactively increased from of amp to of amp 
the base rebate is one component of the calculation for branded drugs and authorized generics  and may or may not result in an increase in rebates for a particular product 
effective march   there was an extension of medicaid rebates to drugs consumed by patients enrolled in medicaid managed care organizations mmcos 
prior to healthcare reform  mmcos were not entitled to medicaid rebates  as the drug benefit was independently managed by the commercial managed care entity 
given our current product portfolio  which is weighted more toward generic products  our exposure to commercial rebates for patients enrolled in mmcos was low prior to march  increased medicaid rebates for products defined as a line extension through application of an inflation penalty back to the original formulation price 
expansion of the number of entities qualifying for public health system phs status and therefore eligible to receive phs pricing  which is typically equal to the net medicaid price after rebates 
revisions to the amp calculation  effective october  this provision had a negligible effect on net revenues and gross margins 
change in the federal upper limit as it relates to the pharmacy reimbursement of multisource drugs 
this provision is expected to reduce the medicaid funding from the federal government 
while it is impractical to quantify the impact of the provision  it is expected to result in increased pressure at the state level to drive medicaid utilization to low cost alternatives such as generic products 
for the year ended december   the impact of healthcare reform resulted in a decrease of approximately million of net revenues and approximately million of gross margin 
the gross margin impact of these provisions is highly dependent upon product sales mix between products that are partnered with third parties and non partnered products 
in  the following provisions will go into effect an annual  non tax deductible  pharmaceutical fee to be assessed by the secretary of the treasury on any manufacturer or importer with gross receipts from the sale of branded prescription and authorized generic drugs to the following government programs and entities medicare part d  medicare part b  medicaid  department of veterans affairs  department of defense  and tricare 
the total pharmaceutical fee  which is set at billion for  will be allocated across the pharmaceutical industry based upon relative market share into these programs 
the total fee increases each year thereafter  reaching billion in the market share calculation utilized to allocate the fee is to be calculated utilizing prior years sales statistics 
based upon internal estimates of total industry sales into specified government programs  we current ly estimate the impact of the pharmaceutical fee on our net income to be between million and million 
in addition  the year to year impact of this provision of healthcare reform will be highly variable depending on o the volume of par s sales of authorized generics  which can vary dramatically based upon our ability to continue to secure authorized generic business development opportunities  and o the volume of strativa s sales of branded products 
a new discount on cost for certain medicare part d beneficiaries for certain drugs  including branded and authorized generic pharmaceuticals  purchased during the part d medicare coverage gap commonly referred to as the donut hole 
the impact of this provision on the gross margin of par is estimated to be approximately million to million and strativa is estimated to be less than million 
additionally  the publication of monthly weighted average amp by therapeutic class and retail price surveys could occur during it is not practical to forecast the impact of this provision on net revenues or gross margin 
any potential impact of healthcare reform on the future demand for our products is not determinable at this time 
any potential future impact on demand could differ between our par and strativa divisions  as well as between individual products within each division 
par pharmaceutical generic products division our strategy for our generic products division is to continue to differentiate ourselves by carefully choosing opportunities with minimal competition eg  first to file and first to mar ket products 
by leveraging our expertise in research and development  manufacturing and distribution  we are able to effectively and efficiently pursue these opportunities and support our partners 
during the year ended december   our generic business net revenues and gross margin were concentrated in a few products 
the top generic products metoprolol succinate er metoprolol  sumatriptan  clonidine  meclizine  dronabinol  tramadol er  omeprazole  chlorpheniramine hydrocodone  nateglinide  cholestyramine powder and cabergoline accounted for approximately of total consolidated revenues and approximately of total consolidated gross margins in the year ended december  we began selling metoprolol in the fourth quarter of as the authorized generic distributor pursuant to a supply and distribution agreement with astrazeneca 
there had been two comp etitors marketing generic metoprolol until the fourth quarter of  when those two companies stopped selling metoprolol due to violations of the fda s current good manufacturing practices 
throughout the first two quarters of  we did not have competition for sales of the four skus packaging sizes of metoprolol that we sell  which resulted in increased volume of units sold coupled with a price increase commensurate with being the sole generic distributor 
watson pharmaceuticals announced in august  however  that the fda had approved two of its andas for metoprolol  and accordingly  we were no longer the sole distributor for those two skus mg and mg 
on april   watson announced that the fda had approved its two other andas for metoprolol  and par was no longer the sole distributor for the mg and mg skus 
our sales volume and unit price for metoprolol were adversely impacted subsequent to each of watson s entries into the m arket 
in addition  wockhardt  an india based pharmaceutical company  announced that it received fda approval for all four strengths of metoprolol on july  our sales volume and unit price for metoprolol were adversely impacted by this second generic competitor 
additional competitors on any or all of the four skus will result in significant additional declines in sales volume and unit price  which would negatively impact our revenues and gross margins including possible inventory writedowns as compared to and as the authorized generic distributor for metoprolol  we do not control the manufacturing of the product  and any disruption in supply due to manufacturing or transportation issues could also have a negative effect on our revenues and gross margins 
in the fourth quarter of  we launched generic versions of imitrex sumatriptan injection mg and mg starter kits and mg and mg prefilled syringe cartridges pursuant to a supply and distribution agreement with glaxosmithkline plc 
from the beginning of to december   we remained the sole generic distributor of three skus with one competitor for a single sku 
the remaining net book value of the associated intangible asset was approximately million at december  and will be amortized over approximately one year 
in august  we launched clonidine tds  the generic version of boehringer ingelheim s catapres tts 
the product is manufactured by a third party development partner with whom we have a profit sharing arrangement 
from launch to july   we were the sole generic distributor of this product 
on july   mylan received fda approval for its generic version of clonidine tds  therefore we were no longer the sole generic distributor 
our sales an d related gross margins for clonidine tds were negatively impacted due to mylan s receipt of fda approval and subsequent launch 
any additional competition could result in significant additional declines in sales volume and unit price  which may negatively impact our revenues and gross margins including possible provisions for inventory to cost of goods sold as compared to and in may  our third party partner received a warning letter from the fda that cited conditions at the facility where clonidine tds is manufactured that the fda investigators believe may violate current good manufacturing practices  based on their observations made between october and december of our third party partner has responded to the warning letter and is working with the fda to conclude this matter  but we cannot guarantee that our partner will not be subject to additional regulatory action by the fda 
this product has a long manufacturing lead time  and any disruption in supply at our third party partner could also have a negative effect on our revenues and gross margins 
we will continue to monitor this matter to assess any potential future negative impact on our sales of clonidine tds and related gross margins 
we marketed meclizine until the supplier of our active pharmaceutical ingredient api experienced an explosion at its manufacturing facility in early subsequently  we qualified a new api source and received the appropriate approval from the fda of our anda to manufacture and market meclizine utilizing our new supplier 
we reintroduced meclizine hcl tablets in mg and mg strengths in the latter half of from the beginning of to may  we believe we were the exclusive supplier of this generic product 
in june  a competitor entered this market 
this new competition negatively impacted our sales and gross margins for meclizine 
any additional competition could result in significant additional declines in sales volume and unit price  which may negatively impact our revenues and gross margins including possible inventory writedowns as compared to and in the third quarter of  we launched dronabinol in mg  mg and mg strengths in soft gel capsules 
we believe we are one of two generic distributors of dronabinol 
we share net product margin  as contractually defined  on sales of dronabinol with svc pharma lp  an affiliate of rhodes technologies 
the remaining net book value of the associated intangible asset was million at december  and will be amortized over approximately three years 
in november  we launched tramadol er  the generic version of ultram er  after a favorable court ruling in the related patent matter 
we are one of two competitors in this market  with the other competitor being the authorized generic 
we manufacture and distribute this product 
in july  we launched two strengths of omeprazole sodium bicarbonate capsules 
omeprazole sodium bicarbonate capsules are the generic version of zegerid 
we were awarded days of marketing exclusivity for being the first to file an anda containing a paragraph iv certification for these two strengths of the product 
we are now one of two competitors in this market  with the other competitor being the authorized generic 
omeprazole sodium bicarbonate capsules had been the subjec t of litigation in the us district court for the district of delaware  but in april  the court ruled in our favor  finding that the related patents were invalid as being obvious and without adequate written description 
the case is currently on appeal to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit 
we will continue to vigorously defend the appeal 
on october   we announced that our licensing partner  tris pharma  inc  had received final fda approval for its anda for hydrocodone polistirex and chlorpheniramine polistirex ciii extended release er oral suspension equivalent to mg of hydrocodone bitartrate and mg of chlorpheniramine maleate per ml 
hydrocodone polistirex and chlorpheniramine polistirex ciii er oral suspension is a generic version of ucb s tussionex  which is used for relief of cough and upper respiratory symptoms associated with allergy or a cold 
nbsp  we participate in a profit sharing arrangement with tris pharma based on our commercial sale of generic tussionex 
we commenced a limited launch of generic tussionex on october  our market share will continue to be limited into the foreseeable future by drug enforcement administration regulations concerning allowable commercial quantities of controlled substances like hydrocodone  which is contained in generic tussionex 
in october  ucb filed a complaint naming us  our development partner tris pharma  and tris pharma s head of research and development as defendants 
the complaint alleged that tris and its head of research and development misappropriated ucb s trade secrets and  by their actions  breached contracts and agreements to which they were bound 
the complaint further alleges unfair competition against the defendants relating to the parties manufact ure and marketing of generic tussionex 
on october   the court denied ucb s petition for a temporary restraining order against us and tris and set a schedule for discovery during which ucb must substantiate its claims 
on december   the court denied ucb s motion for a preliminary injunction  ruling that ucb s alleged trade secrets were known to the public and not misappropriated 
we intend to vigorously defend any appeal by plaintiffs  should one be filed 
in addition  our investments in generic product development  including projects with development partners  are expected to yield approximately to new anda filings during each of  and these anda filings are expected to lead to product launches based on one or more of the following expiry of the relevant month stay period  patent expiry date  and expiry of regulatory exclusivity 
however  such potential product launches may be delayed or may not occur due to various circumstances  including extended litigation  outstanding citizens petitions  other regulatory requirements set forth by the fda  and stays of litigation 
these anda filings would be significant mileposts for us  as we expect many of these potential products to be first to file first to market opportunities with gross margins in excess of the average of our current portfolio 
we or our strategic partners currently have approximately andas pending with the fda  which include first to file and three first to market opportunities 
no assurances can be given that we or any of our strategic partners will successfully complete the development of any of these potential products either under development or proposed for development  that regulatory approvals will be granted for any such product  that any approved product will be produced in commercial quantities or sold profitably 
strativa pharmaceuticals branded products division for strativa  in the near term we will continue to invest in the marketing and sales of our existing product portfolio 
in addition  in the longer term  we will continue to consider strategic new licenses and acquisitions to expand strativa s presence in supportive care and adjacent commercial areas 
in july  we received fda approval for our first nda  and immediately began marketing megace es megestrol acetate oral suspension 
megace es is indi cated for the treatment of anorexia  cachexia or any unexplained significant weight loss in patients with a diagnosis of aids and utilizes the megace brand name that we have licensed from bristol myers squibb company 
the remaining net book value of the trademark was million at december   and will be amortized over approximately two years 
we promoted megace es as our primary brand product from through march with the acquisition of nascobal in march and the fda approvals of oravig tm and zuplenz in  strativa increased its sales force and turned its focus on marketing the full portfolio of products 
in september  we entered into an extended reach agreement with solvay pharmaceuticals  inc which was subsequently acquired by abbott laboratories that provided for our branded sales force to co promote androgel for a period of six years 
as compensation for our marketing and sales efforts  we were receiving up to million annually 
in december  we terminated this agreement and received a million early termination payment 
the marketing and sales efforts will be redirected toward the four products currently in the portfolio 
in july  we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with bioalliance pharma to acquire the us commercialization rights to bioalliance oravig tm miconazole buccal tablets

we manufacture nascobal with assets acquired on march  from mdrna  inc the remaining net book value of the related intangible asset was million at december   and will be amortized over approximately years 
in january  we completed a modest reorganization of the strativa management team approximately positions eliminated and refined our sales and marketin g plan for each of strativa s currently marketed products as part of our on going efforts to maximize the value and potential of our existing product portfolio 
we announced that the president of strativa pharmaceuticals resigned and that effective january   patrick g 
lepore  the chairman  ceo and president of par pharmaceutical companies  inc  assumed day to day oversight of strativa on an interim basis 
we have taken steps to further align the strativa home office sales and marketing team with the objectives of our sales force and to leverage the relevant expertise and experience within our par pharmaceutical generics division 
in conjunction with these events  we recalibrated our target sales for certain of our currently marketed products 
further information regarding such forecasts can be found in our form k filed january  other considerations in addition to the substantial costs of product development  we may incur significant legal costs in bringing certain products to market 
litigation concerning patents and proprietary rights is often protracted and expensive 
pharmaceutical companies with patented brand products increasingly are suing companies that produce generic forms of their products for alleged patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights  which could delay or prevent the entry of such generic products into the market 
generally  a generic drug may not be marketed until the applicable patent s on the brand name drug expires 
when an anda is filed with the fda for approval of a generic drug  the filer may certify either that any patent listed by the fda as covering the branded product is about to expire  in which case the anda will not become effective until the expiration of such patent  or that the patent listed as covering the branded drug is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture  sale or use of the new drug for which the anda is filed 
in either case  there is a risk that a branded pharmaceutical company may sue the filer for alleged patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights 
because a substantial portion of our current business involves the marketing and development of generic versions of brand products  the threat of litigation  the outcome of which is inherently uncertain  is always present 
such litigation is often costly and time consuming  and could result in a substantial delay in  or prevent  the introduction and or marketing of products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  prospects and results of operations 
results of operations results of operations  including segment net revenues  segment gross margin and segment operating income loss information for our par pharmaceutical generic products segment and our strativa branded products segment  consisted of the following revenues compared to total revenues of our top selling products were as follows amounts in thousands product change par pharmaceutical metoprolol succinate er toprol xl sumatriptan succinate injection imitrex clonidine tds catapres tts meclizine hydrochloride antivert dronabinol marinol tramadol er ultram er omeprazole zegerid chlorpheniramine hydrocodone tussionex cholestyramine powder questran nateglinide starlix cabergoline dostinex methimazole tapazole megestrol oral suspension megace propranolol hcl er inderal la n bsp  other other product related revenues total par pharmaceutical revenues strativa megace es nascobal oravig tm zuplenz other product relat ed revenues total strativa revenues for the years ended december  percentage of total revenues in thousands change change revenues par pharmaceutical strativa total revenues the decrease in generic segment revenues in was primarily due to additional competition on all skus packaging sizes of metoprolol succinate er 
the dollar amount decrease of metoprolol revenues for can be attributed to volume of units sold approximately of total dollar decrease with the remainder of the dollar amount decrease due to price 
we expect additional declines in metoprolol revenues in the future as more competitors enter this market 
competition for meclizine beginning in june nbs p  lower other generic revenues  which were primarily driven by termination of supply and distribution agreements and or increased competition affecting both price and volume  including fluticasone  various amoxicillin products  tramadol hcl and acetaminophen  ibuprofen  and propranolol hcl er caps 
the decreases above in were tempered by  the launch of clonidine tds in august as the sole generic distributor  and we remained the exclusive supplier to this market on all strengths through august therefore  had months of sales as compared to five months in on july   mylan received fda approval for clonidine and subsequently launched its product  therefore we were no longer the sole generic distributo r 
our sales and related gross margins for clonidine tds were negatively impacted 
any additional competition will result in significant additional declines in sales volume and unit price which may negatively impact our revenues and gross margins in future periods 
the launch of omeprazole in late june  the launch of chlorpheniramine hydrocodone in october and tramadol er  which launched in the fourth quarter of with the authorized generic as our only generic competitor 
the increase of net sales of dronabinol  mainly due to increased volume 
our only competitor in the generic dronabinol ma rket continues to be watson as the authorized generic 
improved royalties from the sales of fenofibrate  which was launched by our strategic partner in the fourth quarter  and diazepam  which launched by our strategic partner in september net sales of contract manufactured products which are manufactured for us by third parties under contract and licensed products which are licensed to us from third party development partners and also are generally manufactured by third parties were approximately of our total product revenues for and approximately of our total product revenues for the decrease in the percentage is primarily driven by the launch of omeprazole in and tramadol er  which launched in the fourth quarter of  combined with decreased revenues of metoprolol and clonidine 
we are substantially dependent upon contract manufactured and licensed products for our overall sales  and any inability by our suppliers to meet demand could adversely affect our future sales 
the increase in the strativa segment revenues in was primarily due to the continued growth of nascobal  which was relaunched in the second quarter of  coupled with the launches of oravig tm and zuplenz and the million termination payment associated with the discontinuation of the extended reach agreement with solvay pharmaceuticals  inc this increase was offset somewhat by the decrease of megace es  primarily due to lower prescription levels  tempered by a single digit increase in average net selling price 
strativa launched oravig tm in the third quarter of and zuplenz in the fourth quarter of in connection with the launches  our direct customers ordered  and we shipped  oravig tm and zuplenz units at a level commensurate with initial forecasted demand for the product 
due to our relatively limited history in the branded pharmaceutical marketplace  it is impractical to predict with reasonable certainty the rate of oravig tm s and zuplenz s prescription demand uptake and ultimate acceptance in the marketplace 
therefore  during the initial launch phase of oravig tm and zuplenz  we will recognize revenue and all associated cost of sal es as the product is prescribed to patients based on an analysis of third party market prescription data  third party wholesaler inventory data  order refill rates  and all substantive quantitative and qualitative data available to us at the time 
accordingly  for the year ended december   we have recognized million of revenues for oravig tm and million of revenues for zuplenz and deferred revenues of million for oravig tm and deferred revenues of million for zuplenz  related to product that has been shipped to customers but not yet been prescribed to patients 
deferred revenue is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  we will modify our revenue recognition for oravig tm and zuplenz at the time that we have sufficient data and history to reliably estimate trade inventory levels in relation to forward looking demand

the dollar amount increase of metoprolol revenues for can be attributed to volume of units sold approximately of total dollar increase with the remainder of the dollar amount increase due to price 
we launched clonidine in august as the sole generic distributor 
previously  we launched various sumatriptan skus in the fourth quarter of throughout  we remained the sole distributor of three sumatriptan skus with one competitor for a single sku 
in the third quarter of  we launched multiple strengths of dronabinol 
we also commenced shipment of meclizine hcl tablets in mg and mg strengths in the third quarter of other notable launches in were tramadol er  whic h launched in the fourth quarter of  risperidone odt  which launched in the second quarter of  and alprazolam  which launched in the first quarter of these three products are included in other above 
tempering these increases of net sales were lower generic revenues of certain existing products primarily driven by termination of supply and distribution agreements and or increased competition affecting both price and volume  including fluticasone  various amoxicillin products  cabergoline  ibuprofen  and propranolol hcl er caps 
in addition  we experienced declines in many of our other generic products due to volume and pricing pressures  and or product discontinuation as a result of the fourth quarter restructuring of the generic business to trim our generic product portfolio in an effort to retain only those products that deliver acceptable profit 
net sales of contract manufactu red products which are manufactured for us by third parties under contract and licensed products which are licensed to us from third party development partners and also are generally manufactured by third parties were approximately of our total revenues in and approximately of our total revenues in the increase in the percentage is driven by the increased sales of metoprolol  dronabinol and sumatriptan coupled with the launch of clonidine 
we are substantially dependent upon contract manufactured and licensed products for our overall sales  and any inability by our suppliers to meet demand could adversely affect our future sales 
th e increase in the strativa segment revenues in was primarily due to the acquisition of nascobal and the associated relaunch of the product in the second quarter of by strativa 
the net sales decline of megace es in is primarily attributed to the timing of trade buying patterns 
in december  the trade delayed its megace es purchases until after the holidays to the benefit of in december  the trade accelerated its megace es purchases before the holidays to the detriment of our revenue 
megace es also experienced higher returns during as compared to the prior year 
we expect that the megace es product returns rate for will approximate the returns rate 
gross revenues to total revenues d eductions generic drug pricing at the wholesale level can create significant differences between our invoice price and net selling price 
wholesale customers purchase product from us at invoice price  then resell the product to specific healthcare providers on the basis of prices negotiated between us and the providers  and the wholesaler submits a chargeback credit to us for the difference 
we record estimates for these chargebacks as well as sales returns  rebates and incentive programs  and the sales allowances for all our customers at the time of sale as deductions from gross revenues  with corresponding adjustments to our accounts receivable reserves and allowances 
we have the experience and the access to relevant information that we believe necessary to reasonably estimate the amounts of such deductions from gross revenues 
n bsp  some of the assumptions we use for certain of our estimates are based on information received from third parties  such as wholesale customer inventory data and market data  or other market factors beyond our control 
the estimates that are most critical to the establishment of these reserves  and therefore would have the largest impact if these estimates were not accurate  are estimates related to expected contract sales volumes  average contract pricing  customer inventories and return levels 
we regularly review the information related to these estimates and adjust our reserves accordingly if and when actual experience differs from previous estimates 
with the exception of the product returns allowance  the ending balances of account receivable reserves and allowances generally are eliminated during a two month to four month period  on average 
we recognize revenue for product sales when title a nd risk of loss have transferred to our customers and when collectability is reasonably assured 
this is generally at the time that products are received by the customers 
upon recognizing revenue from a sale  we record estimates for chargebacks  rebates and incentives  returns  cash discounts and other sales reserves that reduce accounts receivable 
our gross revenues for the years ended december   december  and december  before deductions for chargebacks  rebates and incentive programs including rebates paid under federal and state government medicaid drug reimbursement programs  sales returns and other sales allowances were as follows for the years ended december  thousands percentage of gross revenues percentage of gross revenues percentage of gross revenues gross revenues chargebacks rebates and incentive programs returns cash discounts and other medicaid rebates and rebates due under other us government pricing programs total deductions total revenues the total gross to net adjustments as a percentage of sales increased for compared to primarily due to an increase in chargebacks  cash discounts and other  and medicaid rebates and rebates due under other us government pricing programs 
chargebacks the increase in the percentage of gross revenues was primarily driven by a significant decrease in sales of products that carry lower than average chargeback rates  mainly metoprolol  coupled with a decrease in the percentage of non wholesaler sales mainly related to metoprolol  and we al so experienced higher chargeback rates for certain products that had additional competition in cash discounts and other the increase is primarily due to price adjustments given major customers to retain metoprolol business and other products that faced additional competition in  coupled with customer mix 
rebates and incentive programs the increase in percentage of gross revenues primarily driven by product and customer mix as a result of the increased competition of key products 
medicaid rebates and rebates due under other us government pricing programs expense increase was due to higher tri c are rebates that were effective january  this was coupled with the impact of the march health care reform acts which led to higher medicaid rebates rates and additional patients eligible for managed medicaid benefits 
these increases were tempered by the favorable settlement with the office of inspector general of the department of veterans affairs regarding a routine post award contract review of our contract for the periods to gross to net deductions are discussed in the critical accounting policies and use of estimates section below

restructuring costs compared to and compared to for the years ended december  in thousands restructuring costs in october  we announced our plans to resize our generic products division as part of an ongoing strategic assessment of our businesses 
in conjunction with this plan  we have taken steps to reduce our research and development expenses by decreasing internal generic research and development effort 
under this plan  we are continuing to concentrate our efforts on completing a more focused portfolio of generic products and will continue to look for opportunities with external partners 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we initiated actions to trim our generic product portfolio in an effort to focus on only those products that deliver acceptable profit 
these actions resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately positions in manufacturing  research and development  and general and administrative functions 
in connection with these actions  we incurred expenses for severance and other employee related costs 
in addition  as part of our plans to resize our generic products division  we determined to abandon or sell certain assets that resulted in asset impairments  and accelerated depreciation expense 
during the year ended december   we incurred additional restructuring costs as we continued to execute this plan  principally driven by charges for one time termination benefit costs recognized in the first quarter

the effect of the standard was that the equity component was included in the additional paid in capital section of stockh olders equity on our consolidated balance sheet and the value of the equity component was treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the convertible debt instruments 
the discounted carrying value for the debt instrument was subsequently accreted to the face value of the notes over their term through additional noncash interest expense 
as such  the carrying value of debt as recorded on the balance sheet was less than the face value of the debt until the day of maturity

interest income for the years ended december  in thousands interest income interest income principally includes interest income derived primarily from money market and other short term investments 
over the past three years  our return on investments was negatively impacted by the overall decline in yields available on reinvested funds and is influenced by the change in our average portfolio balance which declined in due to the cash settlement to pentech  the purc hase price related to our acquisition of nascobal and certain assets from mdrna  and the repurchase throughout the year of senior subordinated convertible notes and increased in principally due to cash from operations

under the terms of the divestiture  we received million during the year ended december  which represen ts our share of the net proceeds of the sale transaction

cash flows used in investing activities were primarily driven by the payment of milestones related to acquisition of product rights related intangibles  capital expenditures tempered by the liquidation of net investments in available for sale debt securities 
cash used in financing activitie s in mainly represented the payment of obligations with the maturity of the senior subordinated convertible notes tempered by the proceeds from stock option exercises 
our working capital  current assets minus current liabilities  of million at december  increased approximately million from million at december   which primarily reflects the cash generated by operations 
the working capital ratio  which is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities  was x at december  compared to x at december  we believe that our working capital ratio indicates the ability to meet our ongoing and foreseeable obligations for the next fiscal months 
detail of operating cash flows year ended in thousands cash received from customers  royalties and other cash paid for inventory cash paid to employees cash paid to all other suppliers and third parties interest received  net income taxes paid received  net net cash provided by operating activities sources of liquidity our primary source of liquidity is cash received from customers 
in  we collected approximately  million with respect to net product sales as compared to approximately  million in the small decrease for as compared to the prior year can be attributed to lower cash receipts from customers  as detailed above  driven primarily by lower sales of metoprolol 
our ability to continue to generate cash from operations is predicated not only on our ability to maintain a sustainable amount of sales of our current product portfolio  but also our ability to monetize our product pipeline and future products that we may acquire 
our par generic product pipeline consists of approximately andas pending with the fda  including first to file and three first to market opportunities 
strativa launched oravig tm in the third quarter of and launched zuplenz in the fourth quarter of our future profitability depends  to a significant extent  upon our ability to introduce  on a timely basis  new generic products that are either the first to market or among the first to market or otherwise can gain significant market share 
no assurances can be given that we or any of our strategic partners will successfully complete the development of any of these potential products either under development or proposed for development  that regulatory approvals will be granted for any such product  that any approved product will be produced in commercial quantities or that any approved product will be sold profitably 
commercializing brand pharmaceutical products is more costly than generic products 
we cannot be certain that our brand product expenditures will result in the successful development or launch of brand products that will prove to be commercially successful or will improve the long term profitability of our business 
another source of potential liquidity is the capital markets 
we filed a  shelf registration statement during the second quarter of  under which we may sell a combination of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  or warrants from time to time for an aggregate offering price of up to million 
effective october   we also entered into a million unsecured credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent and us bank national association as syndication agent 
the credit facility has an accordion feature pursuant to which we can increase the amount available to be borrowed by up to an additional million under certain circumstances 
the credit facility expires on october  we had no borrowings under the credit facility as of the date of this form k 
uses of liquidity our uses of liquidity and future and potential uses of liquidity include the following cash paid for the acquisitions of nascobal from qol medical  llc and certain assets and liabilities from mdrna  inc for approximately million during the second quarter of cash paid for inventory purchases as detailed in detail of operating cash flows above 
the decrease is mainly due to metoprolol inventory buying patterns 
more metoprolol inventory purchases were made in as compared to when we were increasing our supply to meet demand as competitors left the market 
metoprolol inventory levels were higher in the prior year as astrazeneca our supplier increased production  mainly in the second half of  to meet our forecasted demand 
metoprolol inventory dollars at december  were approximately half of the balance at december  we believe the value of the metoprolol inventory at december  is recoverable based on our forecasted demand coupled with metoprolol s four year product life prior to expiration 
cash paid to all other suppliers and third parties as detailed in detail of operating cash flows above 
the decrease is mainly due to lower metoprolol sales and sales of other licensed products that resulted in lower amounts paid to partners 
cash compensation paid to employees as detailed in detail of operating cash flows above 
the increase for this period was mainly due to the bonus payments in the first quarter related to our operating performance as compared to the absence of bonus payments in the prior year period due to our operating performance 
the payment of our outstanding senior subordinated convertible notes that matured in september million principal amount 
cash paid to bioalliance of million in the second quarter of as a result of the fda approval of oravig miconazole buccal tablets

in january  we concluded and settled the routine post award contract review of our contract with the department of veterans affairs for the periods to with the office of inspector general of the department of veterans affairs  resulting in a total cash payment of approximately million which is to be paid in the first quarter of in the event that any of our loss contingencies are ultimately determined to be higher than originally accrued  the recording of the additional liability may result in a material impact on our liquidity or financial condition when suc h additional liability is paid 
potential liabilities related to the outcomes of litigation  such as average wholesale prices awp matters  or the outcomes of investigations by federal authorities  such as the department of justice 
in the event that we experience any loss  such loss may result in a material impact on our liquidity or financial condition when such liability is paid 
capital expenditures are expected to total approximately million 
expenditures related to current business development and product acquisition activities 
as of december   the total potential future payments that ultimately could be due under existing agreements related to products in various stages of development were approximately million 
this amount is exclusive of contingent payments tied to the achievement of sales milestones  which cannot be determined at this time and would be funded through future revenue streams 
normal course payables due to distribution agreement partner s of approximately million as of december  related primarily to amounts due under profit sharing agreements 
we expect to pay substantially all of the million during the first two months of the first quarter of the risk of lower cash receipts from customers due to potential decreases in revenues associated with competition or supply issues related to partnered products  in particular metoprolol  would be mitigated by proportional decreases in amounts payable to distribution agreement partners 
we believe that we will be able to monetize our current product portfolio  our product pipeline  and future product acquisitions and generate sufficient operating cash flows that  along with existing cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  will allow us to meet our financial obligations over the foreseeable future 
we expect to continue to fund our operations  including our research and development activities  capital projects  in licensing product activity and obligations under our existing distribution and development arrangements discussed herein  out of our working capital 
our future product acquisitions may require additional debt and or equity financing  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such additional financing when needed on acceptable or favorable terms 
analysis of available for sale debt securities held as of december  in addition to our cash and cash equivalents  we had approximately million of available for sale marketable debt securities classified as current assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  these available for sale marketable debt securities were all available for immediate sale

approximately million of the total purchase obligations at december  related to metoprolol 
the difference between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized and measured pursuant to fasb asc income taxes represents an unrecognized tax benefit 
an unrecognized tax benefit is a liability that represents a potential future obligation to the taxing authorities 
as of december   the amount represents unrecognized tax benefits  interest and penalties based on evaluation of tax positions and concession on tax issues challenged by the irs 
we do not expect to make a significant tax payment related to these long term liabilities within the next year  however  we cannot estimate in which period thereafter such tax payments may occur 
we believe that it is reasonably possible that approximately million of our existing unrecognized tax positions may be recognized within the next twelve months as a result of settlements or a lapse of the statute of limitations 
for presentation on the table above  we included the related long term liability in the other column 
in december  we reached a settlement in principal with the office of inspector general of the department of veterans affairs related to a routine post award contract review of our contract with the department of veterans affairs for the periods to  which is expected to be paid in from time to time  we enter into agreements with third parties for the development of new products and technologies 
to date  we have entered into agreements and advanced funds and have commitments or contingent liabilities with several non affiliated companies for products in various stages of development 
these contingent payments or commitments are generally dependent on the third party achieving certain milestones or the timing of third party research and development or legal expenses 
due to the uncertainty of the timing and or realization of such contingent commitments  these obligations are not included in the contractual obligations table above as of december  payments made pursuant to these agreements are either capitalized or expensed in accordance with our accounting policies 
the total amount that ultimately could be due under agreements with contingencies was approximately million as of december  this amount is exclusive of contingencies tied to the achievement of sales milestones  which will be funded through future revenue streams 
the significant agreements that contain such commitments are described in notes to consolidated financial statements note research and development agreements

off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements  other than disclosed operating leases 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates critical accounting policies are those policies that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting policies  as discussed below  pertain to revenue recognition and t he determination of deductions from gross revenues  the determination of whether certain costs pertaining to our significant development and marketing agreements are to be capitalized or expensed as incurred  the valuation and assessment of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and inventory valuation 
in applying such policies  management often must use amounts that are based on its informed judgments and estimates 
because of the uncertainties inherent in these estimates  actual results could differ from the estimates used in applying the critical accounting policies 
we are not aware of any likely events or circumstances that would result in different amounts being reported that would materially affect our financial condition or results of operations 
revenue recognition and provisions for deductions from gross revenues we recognize revenues for product sales when title and risk of loss have transferred to its customers  when reliable estimates of rebates  chargebacks  returns and other adjustments can be made  and when collectability is reasonably assured 
this is generally at the time products are received by the customers 
we also review available trade inventory levels at certain large wholesalers to evaluate any potential excess supply levels in relation to expected demand

chargeback credits are issued to wholesalers for the difference between our invoice price to the wholesaler and the contract price through which the product is resold to health care providers 
approximately of our net product sales were derived from the wholesale distribution channel for the year ended d ecember  and of our net product sales were derived from the wholesale distribution channel for the year ended december  the information that we consider when establishing our chargeback reserves includes contract and non contract sales trends  average historical contract pricing  actual price changes  processing time lags and customer inventory information from our three largest wholesale customers 
our chargeback provision and related reserve vary with changes in product mix  changes in customer pricing and changes to estimated wholesaler inventory 
customer rebates and incentive programs are generally provided to customers as an incentive for the customers to continu e carrying our products or replace competing products in their distribution channels with products sold by us 
rebate programs are based on a customer s dollar purchases made during an applicable monthly  quarterly or annual period 
we also provide indirect rebates  which are rebates paid to indirect customers that have purchased our products from a wholesaler under a contract with us 
the incentive programs include stocking or trade show promotions where additional discounts may be given on a new product or certain existing products as an added incentive to stock our products 
we may  from time to time  also provide price and or volume incentives on new products that have multiple competitors and or on existing products that confront new competition in order to attempt to secure or maintain a certain market share 
the information that we consider when establishing our rebate and incentive program reserves are rebate agreements with and purchases by each customer  tracking and analysis of promotional offers  projected annual sales for customers with annual incentive programs  actual rebates and incentive payments made  processing time lags  and for indirect rebates  the level of inventory in the distribution channel that will be subject to indirect rebates 
we do not provide incentives designed to increase shipments to our customers that we believe would result in out of the ordinary course of business inventory for them 
we regularly review and monitor estimated or actual customer inventory information at our three largest wholesale customers for our key products to ascertain whether customer inventories are in excess of ordinary course of business levels 
pursuant to a drug rebate agreement with the centers for medicare and medicaid services  tricare and similar supplemental agreements with various states  we provide a rebate on drugs dispensed under such government programs 
we determ ine our estimate of the medicaid rebate accrual primarily based on historical experience of claims submitted by the various states and any new information regarding changes in the medicaid program that might impact our provision for medicaid rebates 
in determining the appropriate accrual amount  we consider historical payment rates  processing lag for outstanding claims and payments  and levels of inventory in the distribution channel 
we review the accrual and assumptions on a quarterly basis against actual claims data to help ensure that the estimates made are reliable 
on january   the fiscal year national defense authorization act was enacted  which expands tricare to include prescription drugs dispensed by tricare retail network pharmacies 
tricare rebate accruals reflect this program expansion and are based on actual and estimated rebates on department of defense eligible sales 
we accept ret urns of product according to the following criteria i the product returns must be approved by authorized personnel with the lot number and expiration date accompanying any request and ii we generally will accept returns of products from any customer and will provide the customer with a credit memo for such returns if such products are returned between six months prior to  and months following  such products expiration date 
we record a provision for product returns based on historical experience  including actual rate of expired and damaged in transit returns  average remaining shelf lives of products sold  which generally range from to months  and estimated return dates 
additionally  we consider other factors when estimating our current period return provision  including levels of inventory in the distribution channel  significant market changes that may impact future expected returns  and actual product returns  and may record additional provisions for specific returns that it believes are not covered by the historical rates 
we offer cash discounts to our customers  generally of the sales price  as an incentive for paying within invoice terms  which generally range from to days 
we account for cash discounts by reducing accounts receivable by the full amount of the discounts that we expect our customers to take 
in addition to the significant gross to net sales adjustments described above  we periodically make other sales adjustments 
we generally account for these other gross to net adjustments by establishing an accrual in the amount equal to our estimate of the adjustments attributable to the sale 
we may at our discretion provide price adjustments due to various competitive factors  through shelf stock adjustments on customers existing inventory levels 
there are circumstances under which w e may not provide price adjustments to certain customers as a matter of business strategy  and consequently may lose future sales volume to competitors and risk a greater level of sales returns on products that remain in the customer s existing inventory 
as detailed above  we have the experience and access to relevant information that we believe are necessary to reasonably estimate the amounts of such deductions from gross revenues 
some of the assumptions we use for certain of these estimates are based on information received from third parties  such as wholesale customer inventories and market data  or other market factors beyond our control 
the estimates that are most critical to the establishment of these reserves  and therefore  would have the largest impact if these estimates were not accurate  are estimates related to contract sales volumes  average contract pricing  customer inventories and return volumes 
nb sp  we regularly review the information related to these estimates and adjust our reserves accordingly  if and when actual experience differs from previous estimates 
with the exception of the product returns allowance  the ending balances of accounts receivable reserves and allowances generally are processed during a two month to four month period 
research and development agreements we capitalize or expense amounts related to the development of new products and technologies through agreements with third parties based on our determination of our ability to recover in a reasonable period of time its cost from the estimated future cash flows anticipated to be generated pursuant to eac h agreement 
accordingly  amounts related to our funding of the research and development efforts of others or to the purchase of contractual rights to products that have not been approved by the fda  and where we have no alternative future use for the product  are expensed and included in research and development costs 
amounts for contractual rights acquired by us to a process  product or other legal right having multiple or alternative future uses that support its realizability  as well as to an approved product  are capitalized and included in intangible assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or market value 
we establish reserves for our inventory to reflect situations in which the cost of the inventory is not expected to be recovered 
in evaluating whether inventory is stated a t the lower of cost or market  management considers such factors as the amount of inventory on hand  estimated time required to sell such inventory  remaining shelf life  remaining contractual terms of any supply and distribution agreements including authorized generic agreements  and current expected market conditions  including level of competition 
we record provisions for inventory to cost of goods sold 
we capitalize costs associated with certain products prior to regulatory approval and product launch pre launch inventories when it is reasonably certain that the pre launch inventories will be saleable  based on management s judgment of future commercial use and net realizable value 
the determination to capitalize is made once we or our third party development partners have filed an abbreviated new drug application that has been acknowledged by the fda for containing sufficient information t o allow the fda to conduct their review in an efficient and timely manner and management is reasonably certain that all regulatory and legal hurdles will be cleared 
this determination is based on the particular facts and circumstances relating to the expected fda approval of the generic drug product being considered  and accordingly  the time frame within which the determination is made varies from product to product 
we could be required to expense previously capitalized costs related to pre launch inventories upon a change in such judgment  due to a denial or delay of approval by regulatory bodies  a delay in commercialization  or other potential risk factors 
if these risks were to materialize and the launch of such product were significantly delayed  we may have to write off all or a portion of such pre launch inventories and such amounts could be material 
as of december   we had pre launch inventories of million 
should any launch be delayed  inventory write offs may occur to the extent we are unable to recover the full value of our inventory investment 
the recoverability of the cost of pre launch inventories with a limited shelf life is evaluated based on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding the timing of anticipated product launches  including our expected number of competitors during the six month period subsequent to any anticipated product launch 
further  we believe that the inventory balance at december  is recoverable based on january launches and other anticipated launches and the related expected demand for lower priced generic products that may be substituted for referenced branded products upon fda approval 
goodwill and intangible assets we determine the estimated fair values of goodwill and certain intangible assets with definitive lives based on valuations performed by us at the time of their acquisition 
in addition  the fair value of certain amounts paid to third parties related to the development of new products and technologies  as described above  are capitalized and included in intangible assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually  or when events or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
intangible assets are reviewed when events or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles is determined to exist when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the net assets being tested 
impairment of definite lived intangibles is determined to exist when undiscounted forecasted cash flows related to the assets are less than the carrying value of the assets being tested 
as discussed above with respect to determining an asset s fair value  because this process involves management making certain estimates and because these estimates form the basis of the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded  these estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates 
the critical estimates include projected future cash flows related to subject product sales and related estimated costs  assumptions related to the time value of money and weighted average cost of capital  the market capitalization of our company  and the implied value of our business relative to similar companies and relative to acquisitions involving similar companies 
for the nascobal  oravig tm  zuplenz related intangible assets  the critical estimates include future projected prescriptions demand  and the operational execution of the related marketing and sales plans 
as of december   we determined through our estimates that no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets existed 
we will continue to assess the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with applicable accounting guidance and may in the future conclude that impairments exist 
events that may lead to future conclusions of impairment include product recalls  product supply issues  additional competition  pricing pressures from customers  competitors or governmental agencies  failure to execute on marketing and sales plans and or a decrease in our market capitalization 
as a result of the acquisition of kali in  we have amounts recorded as goodwill of million at december  and december  in addition  intangible assets with definite lives  net of accumulated amortization  totaled million at december  and million at december  income taxes we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 
in the normal course of business  our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities  which may result in future tax  interest  and penalty assessments by these authorities 
inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of many tax positions due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation  regulation  and or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in our financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances 
for example  adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law and the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities  new information obtained during a tax examination  or resolution of an examination 
we believe that our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns 
we reco gnize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets  primarily those that have been generated from certain state net operating losses in certain taxing jurisdictions 
in evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets  we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support such an assumption 
implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense 
when evaluating valuation allowances  management utilizes forecasted financial information 
we believe that our estimates for the uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
a five percent change in the amount of the uncertain tax positions would result in a change in income from continuing operations of approximately million 
a five percent change in the amount of the valuation allowance would result in a change in income from continuing operations of approximately million 
use of estimates in reserves we believe that our reserves  allowances and accruals for items that are deducted from gross revenues are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
it is possible however  that other parties applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different allowance and accrual amounts for items that are deducted from gross revenues 
addition ally  changes in actual experience or changes in other qualitative factors could cause our allowances and accruals to fluctuate  particularly with newly launched or acquired products 
we review the rates and amounts in our allowance and accrual estimates on a quarterly basis 
if future estimated rates and amounts are significantly greater than those reflected in our recorded reserves  the resulting adjustments to those reserves would decrease our reported net revenues  conversely  if actual product returns  rebates and chargebacks are significantly less than those reflected in our recorded reserves  the resulting adjustments to those reserves would increase our reported net revenues 
if we were to change our assumptions and estimates  our reserves would change  which would impact the net revenues that we report 
we regularly review the information related to these estimates and adjust our reserves accordingly  if and when actual experience differs from previous estimates 
use of forecasted financial information in accounting estimates the use of forecasted financial information is inherent in many of our accounting estimates  including determining the estimated fair value of goodwill and intangible assets  matching intangible amortization to underlying benefits eg sales and cash inflows  establishing and evaluating inventory reserves  and evaluating the need for valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
such forecasted financial information is based on numerous assumptions  including our ability to achieve  and the timing of  fda approval for pipeline products   our ability to successfully commercialize products in a highly competitive marketplace  the competitive landscape including the number of competitors for a product at its introduction to the market and throughout its product lifecycle and the impact of such competition on both sales volume and price  our market share and our competitors market share  our ability to execute and maintain agreements related to contract ma nufactured products which are manufactured for us by third parties under contract and licensed products which are licensed to us from third party development partners  the ability of our third party partners and suppliers to adequately perform their contractual obligations  our ability to maintain adequate product supply to meet market demand  the reimbursement landscape and its impact on pricing power  the product lifecycle  which for generic products is generally relatively short years  and which for branded products is generally longer years 
we believe that our financial forecasts are reasonable and appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances 
it is possible however  that other parties applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different forecasts and that the application of those forecasts could result in different valuations of certain assets on our balance sheet 
additionally  differences in actual experience versus forecasted experience could cause our valuations of certain assets to fluctuate 
thes e differences may be more prevalent in products that are newly launched  products that are newly acquired  and products that are at the end of their lifecycles or remaining contractual terms of any supply and distribution agreements including authorized generic agreements 
we regularly review the information related to these forecasts and adjust the carrying amounts of the applicable assets accordingly  if and when actual results differ from previous estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements we adopted the provisions of fasb asc business combinations  which require an acquiring entity to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions 
fasb asc changed the accounting treatment for certain specific items  including  acqu isition costs are generally expensed as incurred  minority interests are valued at fair value at the acquisition date  acquired contingent liabilities are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and subsequently measured at either the higher of such amount or the amount determined under existing guidance for non acquired contingencies  in process research and development are recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date  restructuring costs associated with a business combination are generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense 
fasb asc also included a substantial number of new disclosure requirements 
fasb asc applied to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  nb sp  our acquisitions of the worldwide rights to nascobal from qol medical llc and the related assets acquired and operating leases assumed from mdrna  inc in the second quarter of was accounted for under fasb asc refer to notes to consolidated financial statements note acquisitions 
we adopted the provisions of fasb asc business combinations identifiable assets and liabilities  and any noncontrolling interest 
fasb asc states a contingency acquired in a business combination should be measured at fair value if the acquisition date value of that asset or liability can be determined during the measurement period 
this section of the fasb asc was effective as of january  our acquisitions of the worldwide rights to nascobal from qol medical llc and the related assets acquired and operating leases assumed from mdrna  inc in the second quarter of was accounted for under fasb asc refer to notes to consolidated financial statements note acquisitions 
we adopted the provisions of fasb asc fair value measurements and disclosures 
fasb asc established a common definition for fair value to be applied to gaap guidance requiring use of fair value  established a framework for measuring fair value  and expanded disclosure about such fair value measurements 
fasb asc applies to fair value measurements that are already required or permitted by other sections of the fasb asc  except for measurements of share based payments and measurements that are similar to  but not intended to be  fair value 
the fasb has previously concluded in those sections of the fasb asc that fair value is the relevant me asurement attribute 
accordingly  this section of the fasb asc does not require any new fair value measurements 
fasb asc was effective for fiscal years beginning after november  our adoption of fasb asc with respect to financial assets and liabilities as of january  did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
refer to notes to consolidated financial statements note  fair value measurements 
the effective date of fasb asc with regard to non financial assets and liabilities was january  for us 
these non financial assets and liabilities include goodwill 
the adoption of fasb asc for our nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are remeasured at fair value on a non recurring basis did not impact our consolidated financial statements  however  fasb asc could have an impact in future periods 
in addition  we may have additional disclosure requirements in the event we complete an acquisition or incur impairment of our assets in future periods 
the fasb has issued asu no 
 revenue recognition milestone method topic milestone method of revenue recognition 
this asu provides guidance on defining a milestone under topic and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research or development transactions 
consideration that is contingent on achievement of a milestone in its entirety may be recognized as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone is judged to meet certain criteria to be considered substantive 
milestones should be considered substantive in their entirety and may not be bifurcated 
an arrangement may contain both substantive and nonsubstantive milestones that should be evaluated individually 
research or development arrangements frequently include payment provisions whereby a portion or all of the consideration is contingent upon milestone events such as successful completion of phases in a drug study or achieving a specific result from the research or development efforts 
an entity often recognizes these milestone payments as revenue in their entirety upon achieving the related milestone  commonly referred to as the milestone method 
authoritative guidance on the use of the milestone method did not previously exist 
as a result  questions on when and whether the use of this method is appropriate arose 
the amendments in this asu affect entities that provide research or development deliverables in an arrangement in which one or more payments are contingent upon achieving uncertain fut ure events or circumstances 
the amendments in this asu provide guidance on the criteria that should be met for determining whether the milestone method of revenue recognition is appropriate 
an entity can recognize consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a milestone in its entirety as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone meets all criteria to be considered substantive 
determining whether a milestone is substantive is a matter of judgment made at the inception of the arrangement 
the following criteria must be met for a milestone to be considered substantive 
the consideration earned by achieving the milestone should be commensurate with either of the following a 
the entity s performance to achieve the milestone  or b 
the enhancement of the v alue of the item delivered as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the entity s performance to achieve the milestone  relate solely to past performance  and be reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement 
an entity s decision to use the milestone method of revenue recognition for transactions within the scope of the amendments in this asu is a policy election 
other proportional revenue recognition methods also may be applied as long as the application of those other methods does not result in the recognition of consideration in its entirety in the period the milestone is achieved 
this asu is not expected to impact our consolidated financial statements  however  it could have an impact in future periods to the extent that we were to enter into contractual arrangements where we would receive milestone payments 
the fasb has issued asu no 
 other expenses topic fees paid to the federal government by pharmaceutical manufacturers 
this asu provides guidance on how pharmaceutical manufacturers should recognize and classify in their income statements fees mandated by the acts 
the acts impose an annual fee on the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry for each calendar year beginning on or after january  an entity s portion of the annual fee is payable no later than september of the applicable calendar year and is not tax deductible 
a portion of the annual fee will be allocated to individual entities on the basis of the amount of their branded prescription drug sales including authorized generic product sales for the preceding year as a percentage of the industry s branded prescriptio n drug sales including authorized generic product sales for the same period 
an entity s portion of the annual fee becomes payable to the us treasury once a pharmaceutical manufacturing entity has a gross receipt from brand prescription drug sales to any specified government program or in accordance with coverage under any government program for each calendar year beginning on or after january  the amendments in this asu specify that the liability for the fee should be estimated and recorded in full upon the first qualifying sale with a corresponding deferred cost that is amortized to expense using a straight line method of allocation unless another method better allocates the fee over the calendar year that it is payable 
the annual fee should be classified as an operating expense in the income statement 
the amendments in this asu are effective for calendar years beginning after december   when the fee initially becomes effective 
the annual impact of this f ee on the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry will be highly variable depending on the volume of our sales of authorized generics and brand products 
based upon internal estimates of total industry sales into specified government programs  we currently estimate the impact of the pharmaceutical fee on our net income to be between million and million 
the fasb has issued accounting standards update asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
the amendments in this asu modify step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determini ng whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
the qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance and examples  which require that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
for public entities  the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is not permitted 
the adoption of this asu is not expected to impact our consolidated financial statements  however  it could have an impact in future periods 
the fasb has issued asu  business combinations topic disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
the amendments in this asu affect any public entity as defined by topic  business combinations that enters into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis 
the amendments in this asu specify that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business c ombination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
the amendments are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  early adoption is permitted 
the requirements of this asu will be applicable to any future business acquisition we complete

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk available for sale debt securities the primary objectives for our investment portfolio are liquidity and safety of principal 
investments are made with the intention to achieve the best available rate of return on traditionally low risk investm ents 
we do not buy and sell securities for trading purposes 
our investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions with investment grade credit ratings  the us government and us governmental agencies 
we are subject to market risk primarily from changes in the fair values of our investments in debt securities including governmental agency and municipal securities  and corporate bonds 
these instruments are classified as available for sale securities for financial reporting purposes 
a ten percent increase in interest rates on december  would have caused the fair value of our investments in available for sale debt securities to decline by approximately million as of that date 
additional investments are made in overnight deposits and money market funds 
these instruments are classified as cash and cash equivalents for financial reporting purposes  which generally have lower interest rate risk relative to investment s in debt securities and changes in interest rates generally have little or no impact on their fair values 
for cash  cash equivalents and available for sale debt securities  a ten percent decrease in interest rates would decrease the interest income we earned by approximately million on an annual basis 
the following table summarizes the carrying value of available for sale securities that subject us to market risk at december  and december  amounts in thousands december  december  securities issued by government agencies debt securities issued by various state and local municipalities and agencies other debt securities marketable equity securities available for sale total we do not have any financial obligations exposed to significant variability in interest rates
