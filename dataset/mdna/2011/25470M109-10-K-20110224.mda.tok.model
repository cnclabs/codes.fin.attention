risk factors in this annual report on form k 
executive summary overview dish network added approximately  net new subscribers during the year ended december   compared to approximately  net new subscribers during the same period in this decrease primarily resulted from increased churn 
our average monthly subscriber churn rate for the year ended december  was  compared to for the same period in churn increased during the year as a result of the increasingly competitive nature of our industry  the current economic conditions  multiple programming interruptions related to contract disputes with several content providers during the fourth quarter of  and our price increases 
in general  our churn rate is impacted by the quality of subscribers acquired in past quarters  our ability to provide strong customer service  and our ability to control piracy 
historically  we have experienced slightly higher churn in the months following the expiration of commitments for new subscribers 
in february  we extended our new subscriber commitment from to months 
consequently  during the second half of  churn was positively impacted by  among other things  this increase in our new subscriber commitment period 
during the year ended december   dish network added approximately million gross new subscribers compared to approximately million gross new subscribers during the same period in  a decrease of 
our gross activations in were negatively impacted relative to by increased competitive pressures  including the aggressive marketing and the effectiveness of certain competitors promotional offers  which included an increased level of discounts 
programming costs continue to represent an increasing percentage of our subscriber related expenses 
going forward  our margins may face further pressure if we are unable to renew our long term programming contracts on favorable pricing and other economic terms 
additionally  our gross new subscriber additions and subscriber churn rate may be negatively impacted if we are unable to renew our long term programming contracts before they expire 
during the fourth quarter of  our gross subscriber activations and subscriber churn were negatively impacted as a result of multiple programming interruptions related to contract disputes with several content providers 
as the pay tv industry matures  we and our competitors increasingly must seek to attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from each other s existing subscriber bases rather than from first time purchasers of pay tv services 
some of our competitors have been especially aggressive by offering discounted programming and services for both new and existing subscribers 
furthermore  although we seek to remain the low cost provider in the pay tv industry in the us  our price increases during along with our inability to effectively market our low cost position contributed to increased churn 
in addition  programming offered over the internet has become more prevalent as the speed and quality of broadband networks have improved 
significant changes in consumer behavior with regard to the means by which they obtain video entertainment and information in response to digital media competition could mate rially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition or otherwise disrupt our business 
while economic factors have impacted the entire pay tv industry  our relative performance has also been driven by issues specific to dish network 
in the past  our subscriber growth has been adversely affected by signal theft and other forms of fraud and by operational inefficiencies at dish network 
to combat signal theft and improve the security of our broadcast system  we completed the replacement of our security access devices to re secure our system during we expect that additional future replacements of these 
table of contents devices will be necessary to keep our system secure 
to combat other forms of fraud  we continue to monitor our third party distributors to ensure adherence to our business rules 
while we have made improvements in responding to and dealing with customer service issues  we continue to focus on the prevention of these issues  which is critical to our business  financial position and results of operations 
to address our operational inefficiencies  we continue to focus on simplifying and standardizing our operations 
for example  we have streamlined our hardware offerings and continue to make significant investments in staffing  training  information systems  and other initiatives  primarily in our call center and in home service operations 
these investments are intended to help combat inefficiencies introduced by the increasing complexity of our business  improve customer satisfaction  reduce churn  increase productivity and allow us to scale better over the long run 
we cannot  however  be certain that our increased spending will ultimately be successful in yielding such returns 
we have been investing more in advanced technology equipment as part of our subscriber acquisition and retention efforts 
initiatives to transmit certain programming only in mpeg and to activate most new subscribers only with mpeg receivers have accelerated our deployment of mpeg receivers 
to meet current demand  we have increased the rate at which we upgrade existing subscribers to hd and dvr receivers 
while these efforts may increase our subscriber acquisition and retention costs  we believe that they will help mitigate subscriber churn in the future and reduce costs over the long run 
we are also continuing to change equipment for certain subscribers to make more efficient use of transponder capacity in support of hd and other initiatives 
we expect to continue these initiatives through we believe that the benefit from the increase in available transponder capacity outweighs the short term cost of these equipment changes 
to maintain and enhance our competitiveness over the long term  we are promoting a suite of integrated products designed to maximize the convenience and ease of watching tv anytime and anywhere  referred to as tv everywhere 
tv everywhere utilizes  among other things  online access and slingbox placeshifting technology 
there can be no assurance that these integrated products will positively affect our results of operations or our gross new subscriber additions 
liquidity drivers like many companies  we make general investments in property such as satellites  information technology and facilities that support our overall business 
as a subscriber based company  however  we also make subscriber specific investments to acquire new subscribers and retain existing subscribers 
while the general investments may be deferred without impacting the business in the short term  the subscriber specific investments are less discretionary 
our overall objective is to generate sufficient cash flow over the life of each subscriber to provide an adequate return against the upfront investment 
once the upfront investment has been made for each subscriber  the subsequent cash flow is generally positive 
there are a number of factors that impact our future cash flow compared to the cash flow we generate at a given point in time 
the first factor is how successful we are at retaining our current subscribers 
as we lose subscribers from our existing base  the positive cash flow from that base is correspondingly reduced 
the second factor is how successful we are at maintaining our subscriber related margins 
to the extent our subscriber related expenses grow faster than our subscriber related revenue  the amount of cash flow that is generated per existing subscriber is reduced 
the third factor is the rate at which we acquire new subscribers 
the faster we acquire new subscribers  the more our positive ongoing cash flow from existing subscribers is offset by the negative upfront cash flow associated with new subscribers 
finally  our future cash flow is impacted by the rate at which we mak e general investments and any cash flow from financing activities 
our subscriber specific investments to acquire new subscribers have a significant impact on our cash flow 
while fewer subscribers might translate into lower ongoing cash flow in the long term  cash flow is actually aided  in the short term  by the reduction in subscriber specific investment spending 
as a result  a slow down in our business due to external or internal factors does not introduce the same level of short term liquidity risk as it might in other industries 

table of contents availability of credit and effect on liquidity the ability to raise capital has generally existed for dish network despite the weak economic conditions 
because of the cash flow of our company and the absence of any material debt payments until october  modest fluctuations in the cost of capital will not impact our current operational plans 
currently  we have no existing lines of credit  nor have we historically 
future liquidity our subscriber related expenses as a percentage of subscriber related revenue was during the year ended december  compared to during the same period in arpu was positively impacted by price increases in february and june subscriber related expenses continued to be negatively impacted by increased programming costs and initiatives to improve customer service 
we continue to focus on addressing operational inefficiencies specific to dish network  which we believe will contribute to long term subscriber growth 
if we are unsuccessful in overturning the district court s ruling on tivo s motion for contempt  we are not successful in developing and deploying potential new alternative technology and we are unable to reach a license agreement with tivo on reasonable terms  we may be required to eliminate dvr functionality in all but approximately  digital set top boxes in the field and cease distribution of digital set top boxes with dvr functionality 
in that event we would be at a significant disadvantage to our competitors who could continue offering dvr functionality  which would likely result in a significant decrease in new subscriber additions as well as a substantial loss of current subscribers 
furthermore  the inability to offer dvr functionality could cause certain of our distribution channels to terminate or significantly decrease their marketing of dish network services 
the adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations if the district court s contempt order is upheld is likely to be significant 
additionally  the supplemental damage award of million and further award of approximately million does not include damages  contempt sanctions or interest for the period after june in the event that we are unsuccessful in our appeal  we could also have to pay substantial additional damages  contempt sanctions and interest 
depending on the amount of any additional damage or sanction award or any monetary settlement  we may be required to raise additional capital at a time and in circumstances in which we would normally not raise capital 
therefore  any capital we raise may be on terms that are unfavorable to us  which might adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and might also impair our ability to raise capital on acceptable terms in the future to fund our own operations and initiatives 
 we believe the cost of such capital and its terms and conditions may be substantially less attractive than our previous financings 
if we are successful in overturning the district court s ruling on tivo s motion for contempt  but unsuccessful in defending against any subsequent claim in a new action that our original alternative technology or any potential new alternative technology infringes tivo s patent  we could be prohibited from distributing dvrs or could be required to modify or eliminate our then current dvr functionality in some or all set top boxes in the field 
in that event we would be at a significant disadvantage to our competitors who could continue offering dvr functionality and the adverse effect on our business would be material 
we could also have to pay substantial additional damages 
because both we and echostar are defendants in the tivo lawsuit  we and echostar are jointly and severally liable to tivo for any final damages and sanctions that may be awarded by the district court 
we have determined that we are obligated under the agreements entered into in connection with the spin off to indemnify echostar for substantially all liability arising from this lawsuit 
echostar contributed an amount equal to its million intellectual property liability limit under the receiver agreement 
we and echostar have further agreed that echostar s million contribution would not exhaust echostar s liability to us for other intellectual property claims that may arise under the receiver agreement 
we and echostar also agreed that we would each be entitled to joint ownership of  and a cross license to use  any intellectual property developed in connection with any pote ntial new alternative technology 
if voom prevails in its breach of contract suit against us  we could be required to pay substantial damages  which would have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations 
in january  voom hd holdings voom filed a lawsuit against us in new york supreme court  alleging breach of contract and other 
table of contents claims arising from our termination of the affiliation agreement governing carriage of certain voom hd channels on the dish network satellite tv service 
at that time  voom also sought a preliminary injunction to prevent us from terminating the agreement 
the court denied voom s request  finding  among other things  that voom had not demonstrated that it was likely to prevail on the merits 
in april  we and voom each filed motions for summary judgment 
voom later filed two motions seeking discovery sanctions 
on november   the court issued a decision denying both motions for summary judgment  but granting voom s motions for discovery sanctions 
the court s decision provides for an adverse inference jury instruction at trial and precludes our damages expert from testifying at trial 
we appealed the grant of voom s motion for disc overy sanctions to the new york state supreme court  appellate division  first department 
on february   the appellate court granted our motion to stay the trial pending our appeal 
voom is claiming over billion in damages 
we entered into an million credit facility with dbsd north america on february  the credit facility remains subject to approval by the bankruptcy court 
in addition  on february  we committed to acquire of the equity of reorganized dbsd north america for approximately billion subject to certain adjustments  including interest accruing on dbsd north america s existing debt 
this transaction is to be completed upon satisfaction of certain conditions  including approval by the fcc and dbsd north america s emergence from bankruptcy 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k for further discussion 
the spin off 
on january   we completed the distribution of our technology and set top box business and certain infrastructure assets the spin off into a separate publicly traded company  echostar 
dish network and echostar operate as separate publicly traded companies  and neither entity has any ownership interest in the other 
however  a substantial majority of the voting power of the shares of both companies is owned beneficially by charles w 
ergen  our chairman  president and chief executive officer or by certain trusts established by mr 
ergen for the benefit of his family 
explanation of key metrics and other items subscriber related revenue 
subscriber related revenue consists principally of revenue from basic  premium movie  local  hd programming  pay per view  latino and international subscription television services  equipment rental fees and other hardware related fees  including fees for dvrs  equipment upgrade fees and additional outlet fees from subscribers with multiple receivers  advertising services  fees earned from our in home service operations and other subscriber revenue 
certain of the amounts included in subscriber related revenue are not recurring on a monthly basis 
equipment sales and other revenue 
equipment sales and other revenue principally includes the non subsidized sales of dbs accessories to retailers and other third party distributors of our equipment domestically and to dish network subscribers 
equipment sales  services and other revenue echostar 
equipment sales  services and other revenue echostar includes revenue related to equipment sales  professional services  and other agreements with echostar 
subscriber related expenses 
subscriber related expenses principally include programming expenses  costs incurred in connection with our in home service and call center operations  billing costs  refurbishment and repair costs related to receiver systems  subscriber retention and other variable subscriber expenses 
satellite and transmission expenses echostar 
satellite and transmission expenses echostar includes the cost of leasing satellite and transponder capacity from echostar and the cost of digital broadcast operations provided to us by echostar  including satellite uplinking downlinking  signal processing  conditional access management  telemetry  tracking and control  and other professional services 
satellite and transmission expenses other 
satellite and transmission expenses other includes executory costs associated with capital leases and costs associated with transponder leases and other related services 
equipment  services and other cost of sales 
equipment  services and other cost of sales principally includes the cost of non subsidized sales of dbs accessories to retailers and other third party distributors of our equipment 
table of contents domestically and to dish network subscribers 
in addition  this category includes costs related to equipment sales  professional services  and other agreements with echostar 
subscriber acquisition costs 
in addition to leasing receivers  we generally subsidize installation and all or a portion of the cost of our receiver systems to attract new dish network subscribers 
our subscriber acquisition costs include the cost of our receiver systems sold to retailers and other third party distributors of our equipment  the cost of receiver systems sold directly by us to subscribers  including net costs related to our promotional incentives  costs related to our direct sales efforts and costs related to installation and acquisition advertising 
we exclude the value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new su bscribers from subscriber acquisition costs 
sac 
subscriber acquisition cost measures are commonly used by those evaluating companies in the pay tv industry 
we are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating the average subscriber acquisition costs per new subscriber activation  or sac  and we believe presentations of sac may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses 
our sac is calculated as subscriber acquisition costs  plus the value of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers  divided by gross new subscriber additions 
we include all the costs of acquiring subscribers eg  subsidized and capitalized equipment as our management believes it is a more comprehensive measure of how much we are spending to acquire subscribers 
we also include all new dish network subscribers in our calculation  including dish network subscribers added with little or no subscriber acquisition costs 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consists primarily of employee related costs associated with administrative services such as legal  information systems  accounting and finance  including non cash  stock based compensation expense 
it also includes outside professional fees eg  legal  information systems and accounting services and other items associated with facilities and administration 
interest expense  net of amounts capitalized 
interest expense  net of amounts capitalized primarily includes interest expense  prepayment premiums and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our senior debt and convertible subordinated debt securities net of capitalized interest  and interest expense associated with our capital lease obligations 
other  net 
the main components of other  net are gains and losses realized on the sale of investments  impairment of marketable and non marketable investment securities  unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value of marketable and non marketable strategic investments accounted for at fair value  and equity in earnings and losses of our affiliates 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
ebitda is defined as net income loss attributable to dish network common shareholders plus interest expense  net of amounts capitalized net of interest income  taxes and depreciation and amortization 
this non gaap measure is reconciled to net income loss attributable to dish network common shareholders in our discussion of results of operations below 
dish network subscribers 
we include customers obtained through direct sales  third party retailers and other third party distribution relationships in our dish network subscriber count 
we also provide dish network service to hotels  motels and other commercial accounts 
for certain of these commercial accounts  we divide our total revenue for these commercial accounts by an amount approximately equal to the retail price of our america s top programming package but taking into account  periodically  price changes and other factors  and include the resulting number  which is substantially smaller than the actual number of commercial units served  in our dish network subscriber count 
average monthly revenue per subscriber arpu 
we are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating arpu and believe presentations of arpu may not be calculated consistently by other companies in the same or similar businesses 
we calculate average monthly revenue per subscriber  or arpu  by dividing average monthly subscriber related revenue for the period total subscriber related revenue during the period divided by the number of months in the period by our average dish network subscribers for the period 
average dish network subscribers are calculated for the period by adding the average dish network subscribers for each month and 
table of contents dividing by the number of months in the period 
average dish network subscribers for each month are calculated by adding the beginning and ending dish network subscribers for the month and dividing by two 
average monthly subscriber churn rate 
we are not aware of any uniform standards for calculating subscriber churn rate and believe presentations of subscriber churn rates may not be calculated consistently by different companies in the same or similar businesses 
we calculate subscriber churn rate for any period by dividing the number of dish network subscribers who terminated service during the period by the average dish network subscribers for the same period  and further dividing by the number of months in the period 
when calculating subscriber churn  the same methodology for calculating average dish network subscribers is used as when calculating arpu 
free cash flow 
we define free cash flow as net cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment  as shown on our consolidated statements of cash flows

our gross activations in were negatively impacted relative to by increased competitive pressures  including the aggressive marketing and the effectiveness of certain competitors promotional offers  which included an increased level of discounts 
dish network added approxima tely  net new subscribers during the year ended december   compared to approximately  net new subscribers during the same period in this decrease primarily resulted from increased churn 
our average monthly subscriber churn rate for the year ended december  was  compared to for the same period in churn increased during the year as a result of the increasingly competitive nature of our industry  the current economic conditions  multiple programming interruptions related to contract disputes with several content providers during the fourth quarter of  and our price increases 
in general  our churn rate is impacted by the quality of subscribers acquired in past quarters  our ability to provide strong customer service  and our ability to control piracy 
historically  we have experienced slightly higher churn in the months following the expiration of commitments for new subscribers 
in february  we extended our new subscriber commitment from to months 
consequently  during the second half of  churn was positi vely impacted by  among other things  this increase in our new subscriber commitment period 
when the size of our subscriber base increases  even if our subscriber churn rate remains constant  increasing numbers of gross new dish network subscribers are required to sustain net subscriber growth 
we have not always met our own standards for performing high quality installations  effectively resolving subscriber issues when they arise  answering subscriber calls in an acceptable timeframe  effectively communicating with our subscriber base  reducing calls driven by the complexity of our business  improving the reliability of certain systems and subscriber equipment  and aligning the interests of certain third party retailers and installers to provide high quality service 
most of these factors have affected both gross new subscriber additions as well as existing subscriber churn 
our future gross new subscriber additions and subscriber churn may be negatively impacted by these factors  which could in turn adversely affect our revenue growth 
subscriber related revenue 
dish network subscriber related revenue totaled billion for the year ended december   an increase of billion or compared to the same period in this change was primarily related to the increase in arpu discussed below as well as a larger average subscriber base during the year ended december  compared to the same period in arpu 
average monthly revenue per subscriber was during the year ended december  versus during the same period in the or increase in arpu was primarily attributable to price increases in february and june and changes in the sales mix toward more advanced hardware offerings 
arpu increased as a result of higher hardware related fees which include rental fees  fees earned from our in home service operations  and fees for dvrs 
this increase was partially offset by increases in the amount of promotional discounts on programming offered to our new subscribers 
equipment sales and other revenue 
equipment sales and other revenue totaled million during the year ended december   a decrease of million or compared to the same period in the decrease in equipment sales and other revenue primarily resulted from a decline in the sales of non subsidized dbs receivers and accessories  and digital converter boxes in compared to the same period in subscriber related expenses 
subscriber related expenses totaled billion during the year ended december   an increase of million or compared to the same period in the increase in subscriber related expenses was primarily attributable to higher programming costs 
the increase in programming costs was driven by rate increases in certain of our programming contracts  including the renewal of certain contracts at higher rates and by a larger average subscriber base 
this increase was partially offset by reduced costs related to our call centers  customer retention  and in home service operations 
we continue to address our operational inefficiencies by streamlining our hardware offerings and making significant investments in staffi ng  training  information systems and other initiatives  primarily in our call centers and in home service operations 
subscriber related expenses 
table of contents represented and of subscriber related revenue during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the improvement in this expense to revenue ratio primarily resulted from an increase in subscriber related revenue and the reduced costs discussed above  partially offset by higher programming costs 
in the normal course of business  we enter into contracts to purchase programming content in which our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the respective content 
our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful in growing our subscriber base 
in addition  our subscriber related expenses may face further upward pressure from price increases and the renewal of long term programming contracts on less favorable pricing terms 
satellite and transmission expenses echostar 
satellite and transmission expenses echostar totaled million during the year ended december   an increase of million or compared to the same period in the increase in satellite and transmission expenses echostar is related to an increase in transponder capacity leased from echostar primarily related to the nimiq satellite  which was placed into service in october  an increase in monthly lease rates per transponder on certain satellites based on the terms of our amended lease agreements and the increase in uplink services 
the increase in uplink services was primarily attributable to the launch of additional local channels and increased costs related to additional satellites being placed into service 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k for further discussion 
satellite and transmission expenses echostar as a percentage of subscriber related revenue increased to in from in primarily as a result of the increase in expenses discussed above 
equipment  services and other cost of sales 
equipment  services and other cost of sales totaled million during the year ended december   a decrease of million or compared to the same period in this decrease in equipment  services and other cost of sales primarily resulted from a decline in the sales of non subsidized dbs receivers and accessories and in sales of digital converter boxes  and lower charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory in compared to the same period in subscriber acquisition costs 
subscriber acquisition costs totaled billion for the year ended december   an increase of million or compared to the same period in this increase was primarily attributable to higher sac discussed below  partially offset by the decline in gross new subscriber additions 
sac 
sac was during the year ended december  compared to during the same period in  an increase of or 
this increase was primarily attributable to increased advertising and hardware costs per activation 
during the years ended december  and  the amount of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers totaled million and million  respectively 
this increase in capital expenditures under our lease program for new subscribers resulted primarily from an increase in hardware costs per activation  which was driven by an increase in the deployment of more advanced set top boxes  such as hd receivers and hd dvrs  and a decrease in the redeployment of remanufactured receivers 
the increase in the deployment of more advanced set top boxes was partially driven by our hd free for life promotion  which began during june capital expenditures resulting from our equipment lease program for new subscribers were partially mitigated by the redeployment of equipment returned by disconnecting lease program subscribers 
however  to remain competitive we upgrade or replace subscriber equipment periodically as technology changes  and the costs associated with these upgrades may be substantial 
to the extent technological changes render a portion of our existing equipment obsolete  we would be unable to redeploy all returned equipment and consequently would realize less benefit from the sac reduction associated with redeployment of that returned lease equipment 
our sac calculation does not reflect any benefit from payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale or used in our existing customer lease program rather than being redeployed through our new lease program 
during the years ended december  and  these amounts totaled million and million  respectively 
we have been deploying receivers that utilize psk modulation technology and receivers that utilize mpeg compression technology for several years 
these technologies  when fully deployed  will allow more programming 
table of contents channels to be carried over our existing satellites 
a majority of our customers today  however  do not have receivers that use mpeg compression and a smaller but still significant percentage do not have receivers that use psk modulation 
we may choose to invest significant capital to accelerate the conversion of customers to mpeg and or psk to realize the bandwidth benefits sooner 
in addition  given that all of our hd content is broadcast in mpeg  any growth in hd penetration will naturally accelerate our transition to these newer technologies and may increase our subscriber acquisition and retention costs 
all new receivers that we have purchased from echostar since utilize mpeg technology 
although we continue to refurbish and redeploy mpeg receivers  as a result of our hd initiatives and current promotions  we currently activate most new customers with higher priced mpeg technology 
this limits our ability to redeploy mpeg receivers and  to the extent that our promotions are successful  will accelerate the transition to mpeg technology  resulting in an adverse effect on our sac 
our subscriber acquisition costs and sac may materially increase in the future to the extent that we transition to newer technologies  introduce more aggressive promotions  or provide greater equipment subsidies

see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k for further discussion 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense totaled million during the year ended december   a million or increase compared to the same period in the change in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to an increase in depreciation on satellites  as a result of echostar xiv and echostar xv being placed into service and on equipment leased to subscribers

as of december   we had approximately million dish network subscribers compared to approximately million subscribers at december   an increase of 
dish network added approximately million gross new subscribers for the year ended december   compared to approximately million during the same period in  an increase of 
dish network added approximately  net new subscribers during the year ended december   compared to a loss of approximately  net new subscribers during the same period in as a result of higher gross subscriber additions and reduced churn 
our increased gross subscriber additions were primarily a result of our sales and marketing promotions during the last half of our average monthly subscriber churn rate for the year ended december  was  compared to for the same period in churn was positively impacted by  among other things  the completion of our security access device replacement program  an increase in our new subscriber commitment period and initiatives to retain subscribers 
historically  we have experienced slightly higher churn in the months following the expiration of commitments for new subscribers 
in febr uary  we extended the required new subscriber commitment from to months 
during the last half of  due to the change in promotional mix  we had fewer expiring new subscriber commitments 
subscriber related revenue 
dish network subscriber related revenue totaled billion for the year ended december   an increase of million or compared to the same period in this change was primarily related to the increase in arpu discussed below  partially offset by the decline in our subscriber base from second quarter through first quarter arpu 
average monthly revenue per subscriber was during the year ended december  versus during the same period in the or increase in arpu was primarily attributable to price increases in february and on some of our most popular programming packages and changes in the sales mix toward hd programming packages and advanced hardware offerings 
as a result of our promotions  which provided an incentive for advanced hardware offerings  we continued to see increased hardware related fees  which included fees earned from our in home service operations  rental fees and fees for dvrs 
these increases were partially offset by increases in the amount of promotiona l discounts on programming offered to our new subscribers and retention initiatives offered to existing subscribers  and by decreases in premium movie revenue and pay per view buys 
equipment sales and other revenue 
equipment sales and other revenue totaled million during the year ended december   a decrease of million or compared to the same period during the decrease in equipment sales and other revenue primarily resulted from a decrease in sales of non subsidized dbs accessories 
subscriber related expenses 
subscriber related expenses totaled billion during the year ended december   an increase of million or compared to the same period the increase in subscriber related expenses was primarily attributable to higher costs for programming content and call center operations 
the increase in programming content costs was primarily related to price increases in certain of our programming contracts and the renewal of certain contracts at higher rates 
the increases related to call center operations were driven in part by our investments in staffing  training  information systems  and other initiatives 
subscriber related expenses represented and of subscriber related revenue  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
satellite and transmission expenses echostar 
satellite and transmission expenses echostar totaled million during the year ended december   an increase of million or compared to the increase in satellite and transmission expenses echostar is primarily related to higher uplink center costs  partially offset by fewer transponders leased during the year ended december  compared to the same period in the higher uplink center costs were primarily associated with an increase in the charges from echostar related to infrastructure costs for new ground equipment to support our new satellites and the routine replacement of exis ting uplink equipment 
the decline in transponder lease expense primarily relates to a reduction in the number of transponders leased as a result of the launch of an owned satellite 
this decrease was partially offset by the increase in expense related to the nimiq satellite  which was placed in service in october satellite and transmission expenses echostar as a percentage of subscriber related revenue increased to in from in 
table of contents equipment  services and other cost of sales 
equipment  services and other cost of sales totaled million during the year ended december   a decrease of million or compared to the same period in this decrease in equipment  services and other cost of sales primarily resulted from lower non subsidized sales of dbs accessories  a decline in charges for slow moving and obsolete inventory and a decrease in services provided to echostar under our transition services agreement with echostar 
subscriber acquisition costs 
subscriber acquisition costs totaled billion for the year ended december   an increase of million or compared to the same period in this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in gross new subscribers discussed previously  partially offset by lower sac discussed below 
sac 
sac was during the year ended december  compared to during the same period in  a decrease of  or 
this decrease was primarily attributable to a change in sales channel mix and a decrease in hardware costs per activation  partially offset by an increase in advertising costs 
the decrease in hardware cost per activation was driven by a reduction in manufacturing costs for new receivers and due to more cost effective deployment of set top boxes  requiring less equipment per subscriber 
these decreases in hardware costs were partially offset by an increase in deployment of more advanced set top boxes  such as hd receivers and hd dvrs 
during the years ended december  and  the amount of equipment capitalized under our lease program for new subscribers totaled million and million  respectively 
this increase in capital expenditures under our lease program for new subscribers resulted primarily from the increase in gross new subscribers 
our sac calculation does not reflect any benefit from payments we received in connection with equipment not returned to us from disconnecting lease subscribers and returned equipment that is made available for sale or used in our existing customer lease program rather than being redeployed through our new lease program 
during the years ended december  and  these amounts totaled million and million  respectively 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses totaled million during the year ended december   an increase of million or compared to the same period in this increase was primarily attributable to additional costs to support the dish network television service including personnel costs and professional fees 
general and administrative expenses represented and of total revenue during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in the ratio of the expenses to total revenue was primarily attributable to the increase in expenses discussed above 
litigation expense 
we recorded million of litigation expense during the year ended december  for supplemental damages  contempt sanctions and interest 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k for further discussion 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense totaled million during the year ended december   a million or decrease compared to the same period in the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to the declines in depreciation expense related to set top boxes used in our lease programs and the abandonment of a software development project during that was designed to support our it systems 
the decrease related to set top boxes was primarily attributable to capitalization of a higher mix of new advanced equipment in compared to the same period in  which has a longer estimated useful life 
in addition  the satellite depreciation expense declined due to the retirements of certa in satellites from commercial service  almost entirely offset by depreciation expense associated with satellites placed in service in interest income 
interest income totaled million during the year ended december   a decrease of million or compared to the same period in this decrease principally resulted from lower percentage returns earned on our cash and marketable investment securities  partially offset by higher average cash and marketable investment securities balances during the year ended december  interest expense  net of amounts capitalized 
interest expense  net of amounts capitalized totaled million during the year ended december   an increase of million or compared to the same period in this change primarily resulted from an increase in interest expense related to the issuance of debt during and

ebitda is used as a measurement of operating efficiency and overall financial performance and we believe it to be a helpful measure for those evaluating companies in the pay tv industry 
conceptually  ebitda measures the amount of income generated each period that could be used to service debt  pay taxes and fund capital expenditures 
ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
income tax provision benefit  net 
our income tax provision was million during the year ended december   a decrease of million compared to the same period in the decrease in the provision was primarily related to the decrease in income loss before income taxes and a decrease in our effective tax rate 
during the year ended december   our effective tax rate was negatively impacted by the establishment of an million valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  which are capital in nature 
net income loss attributable to dish network common shareholders 
net income loss attributable to dish network common shareholders was million during the year ended december   a decrease of million compared to million for the same period in the decrease was primarily attributable to the changes in revenue and expenses discussed above 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities we consider all liquid investments purchased within days of their maturity to be cash equivalents 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further discussion regarding our marketable investment securities 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities totaled billion compared to billion as of december   an increase of million 
this increase in cash  cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities was primarily related to cash generated from operations of billion  partially offset by capital expenditures of billion  including the million assignment from echostar of certain rights under a launch contract  and by repurchases of our class a common stock totaling million 
we have investments in various debt and equity instruments including corporate bonds  corporate equity securities  government bonds  and variable rate demand notes vrdns 
vrdns are long term floating rate municipal bonds with embedded put options that allow the bondholder to sell the security at par plus accrued interest 
all of the put options are secured by a pledged liquidity source 
our vrdn portfolio is comprised of investments in many municipalities  which are backed by financial institutions or other highly rated companies that serve as the pledged liquidity source 
while they are classified as marketable investment securities  the put option allows vrdns to be liquidated generally on a same day or on a five business day settlement basis 
as of december  and  we held vrdns  within our current marketable investment securities portfolio  with fa ir values of billion and billion  respectively 
the following discussion highlights our cash flow activities during the years ended december   and free cash flow we define free cash flow as net cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment  as shown on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
we believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures  during a given period  the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations  make investments  fund acquisitions and for certain other activities 
free cash flow is not a measure determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered a substitute for operating income  net income  net cash flows from operating activities or any other measure determined in accordance with gaap 
since free cash flow includes investments in operating assets  we believe this non gaap liquidity measure is useful in addition to the most directly comparable gaap measure net cash flow s from operating activities 
during the years ended december   and  free cash flow was significantly impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities and in purchases of property and equipment as shown in the net cash flows from operating activities and net cash flows from investing sections  respectively  of our consolidated statements of cash flows included herein 
operating asset and liability balances can fluctuate significantly from period to period and there can be no assurance that free cash flow will not be negatively impacted by material changes in operating assets and liabilities in future periods  since these changes depend upon  among other things  management s timing of payments and control of inventory levels  and cash receipts 
in addition to fluctuations resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities  free cash flow can vary signi ficantly from period to period depending upon  among other things  subscriber growth  subscriber revenue  subscriber churn  subscriber acquisition costs including amounts capitalized under our equipment lease programs  operating efficiencies  increases or decreases in purchases of property and equipment  and other factors

the decrease in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities is principally attributable to the increase in inventory and timing differences between book expense and cash paym ents  primarily related to income taxes and litigation expense 
the increase in purchases of property and equipment in was primarily attributable to the assignment of certain rights under a launch contract for echostar xv and an increase in expenditures for equipment under our lease program for new subscribers

the increase in cash resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily relates to timing differences between book expense and cash payments  including a million increase in the litigation accrual and a million increase in cash flow related to working capital changes and other long term operating assets 
the decrease in purchases of property and equipment in was primarily attributable to a decline in expenditures for satellite construction  and equipment under our lease program for existing subscribers  partially offset by increased spending for equipment under our lease program for new subscribers 
cash flows from operating activities 
we typically reinvest the cash flow from operating activities in our business primarily to grow our subscriber base and to expand our infrastructure 
for the years ended december   and  we reported net cash flows from operating activities of billion  billion  and billion  respectively 
see discussion of changes in net cash flows from operating activities included in free cash flow above 
cash flows from investing activities 
our investing activities generally include purchases and sales of marketable investment securities  strategic investments and cash used to grow our subscriber base and expand our infrastructure 
for the years ended december   and  we reported net cash outflows from investing activities of billion  billion and billion  respectively 
during the years ended december   and  capital expenditures for new and existing customer equipment totaled million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in net cash outflows from investing activities from to of billion primarily resulted from a net decrease in purchases of marketable investment securities  partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures including the assignment of certain rights under a launch contract from echostar 
the increase in net cash outflows from investing activities from to of billion primarily resulted from a net increase in purchases of marketable investment securities  a decrease in proceeds from the sale of investments and an increase in cash used for the purchases of strategic investments 
the overall net increases were partially offset by 
table of contents cash used for purchases of fcc licenses during and a decrease in cash used for purchases of property and equipment during compared to cash flows from financing activities 
our financing activities generally include net proceeds related to the issuance of long term debt  cash used for the repurchase  redemption or payment of long term debt and capital lease obligations  dividends paid on our class a and class b common stock and repurchases of our class a common stock 
for the year ended december   we reported net cash outflows from financing activities of million

for the year ended december   we reported net cash outflows from financing activities of billion 
the net cash inflows in primarily related to the issuance of long term debt  partially offset by our dividend payment of million 
the net cash outflows in primarily related to the repurchases of our class a common stock 
the increase in net cash inflows from to primarily resulted from a decrease in the repayment of long term debt and capital lease obligations  an increase in the net proceeds related to the issuance of long term debt and a decline in stock repurchases 
this increase in net cash inflows was partially offset by the dividend payment of million during in addition  the cash outflows were negatively impacted by the distribution to echostar related to the spin off 
other liquidity items subscriber churn dish network added approximately  net new subscribers during the year ended december   compared to approximately  net new subscribers during the same period in this decrease primarily resulted from increased churn 
our average monthly subscriber churn rate for the year ended december  was  compared to for the same period in see results of operations above for further discussion 
there are a number of factors that impact our future cash flow compared to the cash flow we generate at any given point in time  including subscriber churn and how successful we are at retaining our current subscribers 
as we lose subscribers from our existing base  the positive cash flow from that base is correspondingly reduced 
satellites operation of our subscription television service requires that we have adequate satellite transmission capacity for the programming we offer 
moreover  current competitive conditions require that we continue to expand our offering of new programming  particularly by expanding local hd coverage and offering more hd national channels 
while we generally have had in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to transmit our existing channels and some backup capacity to recover the transmission of certain critical programming  our backup capacity is limited 
in the event of a failure or loss of any of our satellites  we may need to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity or relocate one of our other satellites and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite 
such a failure could result in a prolonged loss of critical programming or a significant delay in our plans to expand prog ramming as necessary to remain competitive and cause us to expend a significant portion of our cash to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity 
security systems increases in theft of our signal or our competitors signals could  in addition to reducing new subscriber activations  also cause subscriber churn to increase 
we use security access devices in our receiver systems to control access to authorized programming content 
our signal encryption has been compromised in the past and may be compromised in the future even though we continue to respond with significant investment in security measures  such as security access device replacement programs and updates in security software  that are intended to make signal theft more difficult 
it has been our prior experience that security measures may only be effective for short periods of time or not at all and that we remain susceptible to additional signal theft 
during  we completed the replacement of our security access devices and re secured our system 
we expect additional futu re replacements of these devices will be necessary to keep our system secure 
we cannot ensure that we will be 
table of contents successful in reducing or controlling theft of our programming content and we may incur additional costs in the future if our system s security is compromised 
stock repurchases our board of directors previously authorized stock repurchases of up to billion of our class a common stock 
on november   our board of directors extended the plan and authorized an increase in the maximum dollar value of shares that may be repurchased under the plan  such that we are currently authorized to repurchase up to billion of our outstanding shares of our class a common stock through and including december  as of december   we may repurchase up to billion under this plan 
the following table provides information regarding repurchases of our class a common stock 
for the years ended december  class a common stock repurchases in thousands total number of shares repurchased dollar value of shares repurchased subscriber acquisition and retention costs we incur significant upfront costs to acquire subscribers  including advertising  retailer incentives  equipment  installation  and new customer promotions 
while we attempt to recoup these upfront costs over the lives of their subscription  there can be no assurance that we will 
we deploy business rules such as minimum credit requirements and we strive to provide outstanding customer service  to increase the likelihood of customers keeping their dish network service over longer periods of time 
our subscriber acquisition costs may vary significantly from period to period 
we incur significant costs to retain our existing customers  mostly by upgrading their equipment to hd and dvr receivers 
as with our subscriber acquisition costs  our retention spending includes the cost of equipment and installation 
in certain circumstances  we also offer free programming and or promotional pricing for limited periods for existing customers in exchange for a commitment to receive service for a minimum term 
a component of our retention efforts includes the installation of equipment for customers who move 
our subscriber retention costs may vary significantly from period to period 
other we are also vulnerable to fraud  particularly in the acquisition of new subscribers 
while we are addressing the impact of subscriber fraud through a number of actions  there can be no assurance that we will not continue to experience fraud  which could impact our subscriber growth and churn 
sustained economic weakness may create greater incentive for signal theft and subscriber fraud  which could lead to higher subscriber churn and reduced revenue 

table of contents obligations and future capital requirements contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as of december   future maturities of our long term debt  capital lease and contractual obligations are summarized as follows payments due by period total thereafter in thousands long term debt obligations capital lease obligations interest expense on long term debt and capital lease obligations satellite related obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total the satellite related obligations in our form k for the year ended december  as filed on march  inadvertently excluded the echostar xvi ten year satellite lease commitment  which was agreed to in december  and is expected to commence during the fourth quarter of the obligations associated with this lease would have increased the previously reported satellite related obligations during    and thereafter by approximately million  million  million and million  respectively 
these amounts are included in the table above 
in certain circumstances the dates on which we are obligated to make these payments could be delayed 
these amounts will increase to the extent we procure insurance for our satellites or contract for the construction  launch or lease of additional satellites 
the table above does not include million of liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits which were accrued  as discussed in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  and are included on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  we do not expect any portion of this amount to be paid or settled within the next twelve months 
the table above does not include the million associated with the credit facility we entered into with dbsd north america on february  the credit facility remains subject to approval by the bankruptcy court 
in addition  on february  we committed to acquire of the equity of reorganized dbsd north america for approximately billion subject to certain adjustments  including interest accruing on dbsd north america s existing debt 
this amount is also not included in the table above 
this transaction is to be completed upon satisfaction of certain conditions  including approval by the fcc and dbsd north america s emergence from bankruptcy 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k for further discussion 
we have semi annual cash interest requirements for our outstanding long term debt securities  which are included in the table above 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k for details 
other than the guarantees disclosed in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  we generally do not engage in off balance sheet financing activities 
satellite related obligations satellites under construction 
as of december   we have agreed to lease capacity on two satellites from echostar that are currently under construction 
future commitments related to these satellites are included in the table above under satellite related obligations 

table of contents quetzsat during  we entered into a ten year transponder service agreement with echostar to lease capacity on quetzsat  a dbs satellite  which is expected to be launched during the second half of echostar xvi 
during december  we entered into a ten year transponder service agreement with echostar to lease all of the capacity on echostar xvi  a dbs satellite  which is expected to be launched during the second half of satellite insurance we generally do not have commercial insurance coverage on the satellites we use 
we do not use commercial insurance to mitigate the potential financial impact of in orbit failures because we believe that the premium costs are uneconomical relative to the risk of satellite failure 
while we generally have had in orbit satellite capacity sufficient to transmit our existing channels and some backup capacity to recover the transmission of certain critical programming  our backup capacity is limited 
in the event of a failure or loss of any of our satellites  we may need to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity or relocate one of our other satellites and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite 
purchase obligations our purchase obligations primarily consist of binding purchase orders for receiver systems and related equipment  digital broadcast operations  satellite and transponder leases  engineering and for products and services related to the operation of our dish network 
our purchase obligations also include certain guaranteed fixed contractual commitments to purchase programming content 
our purchase obligations can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to  among other things  management s control of inventory levels  and can materially impact our future operating asset and liability balances  and our future working capital requirements 
programming contracts in the normal course of business  we enter into contracts to purchase programming content in which our payment obligations are fully contingent on the number of subscribers to whom we provide the respective content 
these programming commitments are not included in the contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements table above 
the terms of our contracts typically range from one to ten years with annual rate increases 
our programming expenses will continue to increase to the extent we are successful growing our subscriber base 
in addition  our margins may face further downward pressure from price increases and the renewal of long term programming contracts on less favorable pricing terms 
future capital requirements our senior notes with an aggregate principal balance of billion mature on october  we expect to fund our future working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements from cash generated from operations  existing cash and marketable investment securities balances  and cash generated through raising additional capital 
the amount of capital required to fund our future working capital and capital expenditure needs varies  depending on  among other things  the rate at which we acquire new subscribers and the cost of subscriber acquisition and retention  including capitalized costs associated with our new and existing subscriber equipment lease programs 
the majority of our capital expenditures for are driven by the costs associated with subscriber premises equipment  included in our firm purchase obligations  as well as capital expenditures for our satell ite related obligations 
these expenditures are necessary to operate and maintain the dish network television service 
consequently  we consider them to be non discretionary 
the amount of capital required will also depend on the levels of investment necessary to support potential strategic initiatives  including our plans to expand our national hd offerings and other strategic opportunities that may arise from time to time 
our capital expenditures vary depending on the number of satellites leased or under construction at any point in time  and could increase materially as a result of increased competition  significant satellite failures  or sustained economic weakness 
these factors could require that we raise additional capital in the future 
if we are unsuccessful in overturning the district court s ruling on tivo s motion for contempt  we are not successful in developing and deploying potential new alternative technology and we are unable to reach a license 
table of contents agreement with tivo on reasonable terms  we may be required to eliminate dvr functionality in all but approximately  digital set top boxes in the field and cease distribution of digital set top boxes with dvr functionality 
in that event we would be at a significant disadvantage to our competitors who could continue offering dvr functionality  which would likely result in a significant decrease in new subscriber additions as well as a substantial loss of current subscribers 
furthermore  the inability to offer dvr functionality could cause certain of our distribution channels to terminate or significantly decrease their marketing of dish network services 
the adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations if the district court s contempt order is upheld is likely to be significant 
additionally  the supplemental damage award of million and further awa rd of approximately million does not include damages  contempt sanctions or interest for the period after june in the event that we are unsuccessful in our appeal  we could also have to pay substantial additional damages  contempt sanctions and interest 
depending on the amount of any additional damage or sanction award or any monetary settlement  we may be required to raise additional capital at a time and in circumstances in which we would normally not raise capital 
therefore  any capital we raise may be on terms that are unfavorable to us  which might adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and might also impair our ability to raise capital on acceptable terms in the future to fund our own operations and initiatives 
we believe the cost of such capital and its terms and conditions may be substantially less attractive than our previous financings 
if we are successful in overturning the district court s ruling on tivo s motion for contempt  but unsuccessful in defending against any subsequent claim in a new action that our original alternative technology or any potential new alternative technology infringes tivo s patent  we could be prohibited from distributing dvrs or could be required to modify or eliminate our then current dvr functionality in some or all set top boxes in the field 
in that event we would be at a significant disadvantage to our competitors who could continue offering dvr functionality and the adverse effect on our business would be material 
we could also have to pay substantial additional damages 
because both we and echostar are defendants in the tivo lawsuit  we and echostar are jointly and severally liable to tivo for any final damages and sanctions that may be awarded by the district court 
we have determined that we are obligated under the agreements entered into in connection with the spin off to indemnify echostar for substantially all liability arising from this lawsuit 
echostar contributed an amount equal to its million intellectual property liability limit under the receiver agreement 
we and echostar have further agreed that echostar s million contribution would not exhaust echostar s liability to us for other intellectual property claims that may arise under the receiver agreement 
we and echostar also agreed that we would each be entitled to joint ownership of  and a cross license to use  any intellectual property developed in connection with any pote ntial new alternative technology 
if voom prevails in its breach of contract suit against us  we could be required to pay substantial damages  which would have a material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations 
in january  voom hd holdings voom filed a lawsuit against us in new york supreme court  alleging breach of contract and other claims arising from our termination of the affiliation agreement governing carriage of certain voom hd channels on the dish network satellite tv service 
at that time  voom also sought a preliminary injunction to prevent us from terminating the agreement 
the court denied voom s request  finding  among other things  that voom had not demonstrated that it was likely to prevail on the merits 
in april  we and voom each filed motions for summary judgment 
voom later filed two motions seeking discovery sanctions 
on november   the court issued a decision denying both motions for summary judgment  but granting voom s motions for discovery sanctions 
the court s decision provides for an adverse inference jury instruction at trial and precludes our damages expert from testifying at trial 
we appealed the grant of voom s motion for discovery sanctions to the new york state supreme court  appellate division  first department 
on february   the appellate court granted our motion to stay the trial pending our appeal 
voom is claiming over billion in damages in  we paid million to acquire certain mhz wireless licenses  which were granted to us by the fcc in february to commercialize these licenses and satisfy fcc build out requirements  we will be required to make significant additional investments or partner with others 
depending on the nature and scope of such commercialization and build out  any such investment or partnership could vary significantly 
part or all of our licenses may be terminated for failure to satisfy fcc build out requirements 
we are currently performing a market test to evaluate different technologies and consumer acceptance 

table of contents from time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that may complement our current services and products  enhance our technical capabilities  improve or sustain our competitive position  or otherwise offer growth opportunities 
we may make investments in or partner with others to expand our business into mobile and portable video  data and voice services 
future material investments or acquisitions may require that we obtain additional capital  assume third party debt or incur other long term obligations 
on february   we entered into a commitment to provide a debtor in possession credit facility to dbsd north america and certain of its affiliates  which will consist of a non revolving  multiple draw term loan in the aggregate principal amount of million 
on february   we entered into an investment agreement pursuant to which we have committed to acquire of the equity of reorganized dbsd north america for approximately billion subject to certain adjustments  including interest accruing on dbsd north america s existing debt 
this transaction is to be completed upon satisfaction of certain conditions  including approval by the fcc and dbsd north america s emergence from bankruptcy 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k for further discussion 
volatility in the financial markets has made it more difficult at times for issuers of high yield indebtedness  such as us  to access capital markets at acceptable terms 
these developments may have a significant effect on our cost of financing and our liquidity position 
a portion of our investment portfolio is invested in auction rate securities  mortgage backed securities  and strategic investments  and as a result a portion of our portfolio has restricted liquidity 
liquidity in the markets for these investments has been adversely impacted 
if the credit ratings of these securities deteriorate or the lack of liquidity in the marketplace continues  we may be required to record impairment charges 
moreover  the sustained uncertainty of domestic and global financial markets has greatly affected the volatility and value of our marketable investment securities 
to the extent we require access to funds  we may need to sell these securities under unfavorable market conditions  record further impairment charges and fall short of our financing needs 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
management bases its estimates  judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates  actual results reported in future periods may be affected by changes in those estimates 
the following represent what we believe are the critical accounting policies that may involve a high degree of estimation  judgment and complexity 
for a summary of our significant accounting policies  including those discussed below  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
capitalized satellite receivers 
since we retain ownership of certain equipment provided pursuant to our subscriber equipment lease programs  we capitalize and depreciate equipment costs that would otherwise be expensed at the time of sale 
such capitalized costs are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment  which is based on  among other things  management s judgment of the risk of technological obsolescence 
because of the inherent difficulty of making this estimate  the estimated useful life of capitalized equipment may change based on  among other things  historical experience and changes in technology as well as our response to competitive conditions 
changes in estimated useful life may impact depreciation and amortization on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 
for example  if we decreased the estimated useful life of our capitalized subscriber equipment by one year  annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately million 
accounting for investments in private and publicly traded securities 
we hold debt and equity interests in companies  some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile prices 
we record an investment impairment charge in other  net within other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is judged to be other than temporary 
we monitor our investments for impairment by considering current factors including economic environment  mark et conditions and the operational performance and other specific factors relating to the business underlying the investment 
future adverse changes in these factors 
table of contents could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
fair value of financial instruments 
fair value estimates of our financial instruments are made at a point in time  based on relevant market data as well as the best information available about the financial instrument 
sustained economic weakness has resulted in inactive markets for certain of our financial instruments  including mortgage backed securities mbs and auction rate securities ars 
for certain of these instruments  there is no or limited observable market data 
fair value estimates for financial instruments for which no or limited observable market data is available are based on judgments regarding current ec onomic conditions  liquidity discounts  currency  credit and interest rate risks  loss experience and other factors 
these estimates involve significant uncertainties and judgments and may be a less precise measurement of fair value as compared to financial instruments where observable market data is available 
we make certain assumptions related to expected maturity date  credit and interest rate risk based upon market conditions and prior experience 
as a result  such calculated fair value estimates may not be realizable in a current sale or immediate settlement of the instrument 
in addition  changes in the underlying assumptions used in the fair value measurement technique  including liquidity risks  and estimate of future cash flows  could significantly affect these fair value estimates  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
for example  as of december   we held million of securities that lack obser vable market quotes  and a decrease in our estimated fair value of these securities would result in a decrease of the reported amount by approximately million 
valuation of long lived assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used  other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
we evaluate our satellite fleet for recoverability as one asset group 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
the carrying value of a long lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset or asset group is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss will be recorded in a new line item entitled impairments of indefinite lived and long lived assets on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group 
fair value is determined primarily using the estimated cash flows associated with the asset or asset group under review  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
losses on long lived assets to be disposed of by sale are determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced for estimated selling costs 
among other reasons  changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period 
valuation of intangible assets with indefinite lives 
we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets with indefinite lives annually  and also when events and circumstances warrant 
we use estimates of fair value to determine the amount of impairment  if any  of recorded intangible assets with indefinite lives 
fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
while our impairment tests in indicated the fair value of our intangible assets were significantly above their carrying amounts  significant changes in our estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of intangible assets with indefinite lives in a future period  which will be recorded in a new line item entitled impairments of indefinite lived and long lived assets  on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss and could be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
a decrease in the estimated future cash flows or a increase in the discount rate used in estimating the fair value of these assets while all other assumptions remain unchanged would not result in these assets being impaired 
income taxes 
our income tax policy is to record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
determining necessary valuation allowances requires us to make assessments about the timing of future events  including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities 
we periodically evaluate our need for a valuation allowance based on both historical evidence  including trends  and future expectations in each reporting period 
any such valuation allowance is recorded in either income tax provision benefit  net on our 
table of contents consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss or accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity deficit on our consolidated balance sheets 
future performance could have a significant effect on the realization of tax benefits  or reversals of valuation allowances  as reported in our consolidated results of operations 
uncertainty in tax positions 
management evaluates the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions based on applicable tax law  regulations  case law  administrative rulings and pronouncements and the facts and circumstances surrounding the tax position 
changes in our estimates related to the recognition and measurement of the amount recorded for uncertain tax positions could result in significant changes in our income tax provision benefit  net  which could be material to our consolidated results of operations 
contingent liabilities 
a significant amount of management judgment is required in determining when  or if  an accrual should be recorded for a contingency and the amount of such accrual 
estimates generally are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes 
due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event  it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingent matter  a charge could be recorded in a future period to general and administrative expenses or litigation expense on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
new accounting pronouncements revenue recognition multiple deliverable arrangements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  revenue recognition multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple deliverable arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable to be based on the relative selling price 
this standard is effective january  we do not expect the adoption of asu to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
seasonality historically  the first half of the year generally produces fewer new subscribers than the second half of the year  as is typical in the pay tv service industry 
however  we can not provide assurance that this will continue in the future 
inflation inflation has not materially affected our operations during the past three years 
we believe that our ability to increase the prices charged for our products and services in future periods will depend primarily on competitive pressures 
backlog we do not have any material backlog of our products

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks associated with financial instruments our investments and debt are exposed to market risks  discussed below 
cash  cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities had a fair value of billion 
of that amount  a total of billion was invested in a cash  b vrdns convertible into cash at par value plus accrued interest generally in five business days or less  c debt instruments of the united 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued states government and its agencies  d commercial paper and corporate notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations  and or e instruments with similar risk  duration and credit quality characteristics to the commercial paper and corporate obligations described above 
the primary purpose of these investing activities has been to preserve principal until the cash is required to  among other things  fund operations  make strategic investments and expand the business 
consequently  the size of this portfolio fluctuates significantly as cash is received and used in our business 
the value of this portfolio is negatively impacted by credit losses  however  this risk is mitigated through diversification that limits our exposure to any one issuer 
interest rate risk a change in interest rates would affect the fair value of our cash  cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities portfolio 
based on our december  current non strategic investment portfolio of billion  a hypothetical increase in average interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately million in fair value of this portfolio 
we normally hold these investments to maturity  however  the hypothetical loss in fair value would be realized if we sold the investments prior to maturity 
our cash  cash equivalents and current marketable investment securities had an average annual rate of return for the year ended december  of 
a change in interest rates would affect our future annual interest income from this portfolio  since funds would be re invested at different rates as the instruments mature 
a hypothetical decrease in average interest rates during would result in a decrease of approximately million in annual interest income 
strategic marketable investment securities as of december   we held strategic and financial debt and equity investments of public companies with a fair value of million 
these investments  which are held for strategic and financial purposes  are concentrated in several companies  are highly speculative and have experienced and continue to experience volatility 
the fair value of our strategic and financial debt and equity investments can be significantly impacted by the risk of adverse changes in securities markets generally  as well as risks related to the performance of the companies whose securities we have invested in  risks associated with specific industries  and other factors 
these investments are subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the securities markets and of the underlying businesses 
in general  the debt instruments held in our strategic marketable investment s ecurities portfolio are not significantly impacted by interest rate fluctuations as their value is more closely related to factors specific to the underlying business 
a hypothetical adverse change in the price of our public strategic debt and equity investments would result in a decrease of approximately million in the fair value of these investments 
restricted cash and marketable investment securities and noncurrent marketable and other investment securities restricted cash and marketable investment securities as of december   we had million of restricted cash and marketable investment securities invested in a cash  b vrdns convertible into cash at par value plus accrued interest generally in five business days or less  c debt instruments of the united states government and its agencies  d commercial paper and corporate notes with an overall average maturity of less than one year and rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating organizations  and or e instruments with similar risk  duration and credit quality characteristics to the commercial paper described above 
based on our december  investment portfolio  a hypothetical increase in average interest rates would not have a material impact in the fair value of our restricted cash and marketable investment securities 
noncurrent auction rate and mortgage backed securities as of december   we held investments in auction rate securities ars and mortgage backed securities mbs of million  which are reported at fair value 
events in the credit markets have reduced or eliminated current liquidity for certain of our ars and mbs investments 
as a result  we classify these investments as noncurrent 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued assets as we intend to hold these investments until they recover or mature  and therefore interest rate risk associated with these securities is mitigated 
a hypothetical adverse change in the price of these investments would result in a decrease of approximately million in the fair value of these investments 
other investment securities as of december   we had million of nonpublic debt and equity instruments that we hold for strategic business purposes 
we account for these investments under the cost  equity and or fair value methods of accounting 
a hypothetical adverse change in the price of these nonpublic debt and equity instruments would result in a decrease of approximately million in the fair value of these investments 
our ability to realize value from our strategic investments in companies that are not publicly traded depends on the success of those companies businesses and their ability to obtain sufficient capital to execute their business plans 
because private markets are not as liquid as public markets  there is also increased risk that we will not be able to sell these investments  or that when we desire to sell them we will not be able to obtain fair value for them 
long term debt as of december   we had long term debt of billion on our consolidated balance sheets 
we estimated the fair value of this debt to be approximately billion using quoted market prices for our publicly traded debt  which constitutes approximately of our debt 
the fair value of our debt is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
a hypothetical decrease in assumed interest rates would increase the fair value of our debt by approximately million 
to the extent interest rates increase  our costs of financing would increase at such time as we are required to refinance our debt 
as of december   a hypothetical increase in assumed interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million 
derivative financial instruments from time to time  we speculate using derivative financial instruments  such amounts  however  are typically insignificant
