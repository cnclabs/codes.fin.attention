item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations commitments and contingencies 
competition connecticut water faces competition from a few small privately owned water systems operating within  or adjacent to  our franchise areas and from municipal and public authority systems whose service areas in some cases overlap portions of our franchise areas

annual meeting age shown is as of filing date of march  for further information regarding the executive officers see the company s proxy statement dated march  segments of our business for management and financial reporting purposes we divide our business into three segments water activities  real estate transactions  and services and rentals 
water activities the water activities segment is comprised of our core regulated water activities to supply public drinking water to our customers 
this segment encompasses all transactions of our regulated water company with the exception of certain real estate transactions 
real estate transactions our real estate transactions segment involves the sale or donation for income tax benefits of our real estate holdings 
these transactions can be effected by any of our subsidiary companies 
through land donations and sales in previous years  the company earned tax credits to use in future years 
the company is limited by time and the amount of taxable income when using these credits 
during  the company completed the sale of a conservation easement of approximately acres to the town of windsor locks  ct 
additionally  the company made adjustments to tax valuation allowances associated with land donations made in previous years 
finally  chester realty sold a non regulated rental property in killingly  ct for a small profit 
during and  the company did not make any land sales or donations  however  it did adjust its valuation allowances 
the company is currently in discussions to sell approximately acres to the town of plymouth  ct for open space purposes 
the company expects the transaction  if approved by the town s residents and the dpuc  to be completed in late or early a breakdown of the net income of this segment between our regulated and unregulated companies for the past three years is as follows income loss from real estate transactions from continuing operations regulated unregulated total 
table of contents services and rentals our services and rentals segment provides contracted services to water and wastewater utilities and other clients and also leases certain of our properties to third parties through our unregulated companies 
the types of services provided include contract operations of water and wastewater facilities  linebacker  our service line protection plan for public drinking water customers  and providing bulk deliveries of emergency drinking water to businesses and residences via tanker truck 
our lease and rental income comes primarily from the renting of residential and commercial property 
linebacker is an optional service line protection program offered by the company to eligible residential customers through newus covering the cost of repairs for leaking or broken water service lines which provide drinking water to a customer s home 
for customers who enroll in this program  the company will repair or replace a leaking or broken water service line  curb box  curb box cover  meter pit  meter pit cover  meter pit valve plus in home water main shut off valve before the meter 
beginning in january with the acquisition of certain assets from home service usa  newus expanded its coverage offerings to connecticut water customers for failure of in home plumbing and sewer and septic drainage lines 
depending on the coverage selected  the linebacker program costs between and per year for residential customers 
as of december   the company had  customers enrolled in its linebacker protection program 
of these   customers were enrolled in one of the expanded plans 
some of the services listed above  including the service line protection plan  have little or no competition 
but there can be considerable competition for contract operations of large water and wastewater facilities and systems 
however  we have sought to develop a niche market by seeking to serve smaller facilities and systems in our service areas where there is less competition 
the services and rentals segment  while still a relatively small portion of our overall business  has grown over the past five years and has provided approximately  and of our overall net income in  and  respectively

item a 
risk factors our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth below  any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or anticipated future results 
for a discussion identifying additional risk factors and important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated  see the discussion in forward looking information in item below management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes to consolidated financial statements 
because we incur significant capital expenditures annually  we depend on the rates we charge our customers  which are subject to regulation 
the water utility business is capital intensive 
on an annual basis  we spend significant sums for additions to or replacement of property  plant and equipment 
our ability to maintain and meet our financial objectives is dependent upon the rates we charge our customers 
these rates are subject to approval by the dpuc 
the company is entitled to file rate increase requests  from time to time  to recover our investments in utility plant and expenses 
once a rate increase petition is filed with the dpuc  the ensuing administrative and hearing process may be lengthy and costly 
we can provide no assurances that any future rate increase requests will be approved by the dpuc  and  if approved  we cannot guarantee that any such rate increase requests will be granted in a timely or sufficient manner to cover the investments and expenses for which we initially sought the rate increase 
additionally  the dpuc may rule that a company must reduce its rates 
under a law  the dpuc may authorize regulated water companies to use a rate adjustment mechanism  known as a water infrastructure and conservation adjustment wica  for eligible projects completed and in service for the benefit of the customers 
for more information related to wica  please refer to the executive overview found in item of this form k 
if we are unable to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness as it comes due  or we default under certain other provisions of our loan documents  our indebtedness could be accelerated and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
as of december   we had million in long term debt outstanding and million in bank loans payable 
our ability to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness as it comes due will depend upon our current and future performance 
our performance is affected by many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we believe that our cash generated from operations  and  if necessary  borrowing under our existing and planned credit facilities  will be sufficient to enable us to make our debt payments as they become due 
if  however  we do not generate sufficient cash  we may be required to refinance our obligations or sell additional equity  which may be on terms that are not favorable to the company as current terms 
no assurance can be given that any refinancing or sale of equity will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms 
in addition  our failure to comply with certain provisions contained in our trust indentures and loan agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness could lead to a default on these documents  which could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness 
credit market volatility may affect our ability to refinance our existing debt  borrow funds under our existing lines of credit or incur additional debt 
during certain periods over the past several years  the volatility and disruption in the credit markets reached unprecedented levels 
in many cases  the markets contained limited credit capacity for certain issuers  and lenders had requested shorter terms 
the market for new debt financing was limited and in some cases not available at all 
in addition  the markets had increased the uncertainty that lenders will be able to comply with their previous commitments 
the company noted improvements beginning during the second half of and throughout if market disruption and volatility return  the company may not be able to refinance our existing debt when it comes due  draw upon our existing lines of credit or incur additional debt  which may require us to seek other funding sources to meet our liquidity needs or to fund our capital expenditures budget 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain debt or other financing on reasonable terms  or at all 
failure to maintain our existing credit ratings could affect our cost of funds and related margins and liquidity position 
since  standard poor ratings services has rated our outstanding debt and has given credit ratings to us and our subsidiary the connecticut water company 
their evaluations are based on a number of factors  which include financial strength as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting 
on november   standard poor ratings services reaffirmed their a credit rating on connecticut water service  inc and the connecticut water company  both with an outlook of stable 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current strong credit ratings 
failure to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins and liquidity position 

table of contents market disruptions caused by the worldwide financial crisis could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet long term commitments  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
during  the company increased its lines of credit from million to million 
during  the company renewed these lines of credit as they expired  with similar terms 
we rely on our revolving credit facilities and the capital markets to satisfy our liquidity needs 
a return to disruptions in the credit markets or further deterioration of the banking industry s financial condition  may discourage or prevent lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments  extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments 
market disruptions may also limit our ability to issue debt securities in the capital markets 
our inability to comply with debt covenants under our credit facilities could result in prepayment obligations 
we are obligated to comply with debt covenants under our loan and debt agreements 
failure to comply with covenants under our credit facilities could result in an event of default  which if not timely cured or waived  could result in us being required to repay or finance these borrowings before their due date  could limit future borrowings  and result in cross default issues and increase borrowing costs 
the covenants are normal and customary in bank and loan agreements 
the company was in compliance with all covenants at december  market conditions may unfavorably impact the value of our benefit plan assets and liabilities which then could require significant additional funding 
the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the company s pension and postretirement benefit plans and could significantly impact our results of operations and financial position 
as detailed in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company has significant obligations in these areas and the company holds significant assets in these trusts 
these assets are subject to market fluctuations  which may affect investment returns  which may fall below the company s projected return rates 
a decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under the company s pension and postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in value 
additionally  the company s pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
as interest rates decrease  the liabilities increase  potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements 
further  changes in demographics  including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
also  future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable from our customers  and the results of operations and financial position of the company could be negatively affected 
our operating costs could be significantly increased because of state and federal environmental and health and safety laws and regulations 
our water and wastewater operations are governed by extensive federal and state environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations  including the federal safe drinking water act  the clean water act and similar state laws  and federal and state regulations issued under these laws by the us environmental protection agency and state environmental regulatory agencies 
these laws and regulations establish  among other things  criteria and standards for drinking water and for discharges into the waters of the united states and or connecticut 
pursuant to these laws  we are required to obtain various environmental permits from environmental regulatory agencies for our operations 
we cannot assure that we have been or will be at all times in full compliance with these laws  regulations and permits 
if we violate or fail to comply with these laws  regulations or permits  we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 
environmental laws and regulations are complex and change frequently 
these laws  and the enforcement thereof  have tended to become more stringent over time 
while we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with these laws and our permits  it is possible that new or stricter standards could be imposed that will raise our operating costs 
although these costs may be recovered in the form of higher rates  there can be no assurance that the dpuc would approve rate increases to enable us to fully recover such costs 
in summary  we cannot be assured that our costs of complying with  or discharging liabilities under  current and future environmental and health and safety laws will not adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
climate change laws and regulations may be adopted that could require compliance with greenhouse gas emissions standards and other climate change initiatives 
additional capital expenditures could be required and our operating costs could be increased in order to comply with new regulatory standards imposed by federal and state environmental agencies 
climate change is receiving ever increasing attention worldwide 
many scientists  legislators  and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases  including carbon dioxide  which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions 
possible new climate change laws and regulations  if enacted  may require us to monitor and or change our utility operations 
it is possible that new standards could be imposed that will require additional capital expenditures or raise our operating costs 
because it is uncertain what laws will be enacted  we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws on our future consolidated financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
although these expenditures and costs may be recovered in the form of higher rates  there can be no assurance that the dpuc or other regulatory bodies that govern our business would permit us to recover such expenditures and costs 
we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with new standards or laws will not adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
new streamflow regulations could potentially impact our ability to serve our customers 
in  the connecticut department of environmental protection dep formally proposed new regulations relative to the flow of water in the state s rivers and streams 
in october and again in december  the state legislature s regulations review committee rejected the proposed rules as written  and later as revised by the dep 
since the regulations were rejected  the dep is working to develop regulations that will be acceptable to a majority of stakeholders 
any new streamflow regulation has the potential to restrict our access to water  raise our capital and operating expenses and adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
although these costs may be recovered in the form of higher rates  there can be no assurance the dpuc would approve rate increases to enable us to recover such costs 
our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations which could adversely affect demand for our water services and our revenues 
demand for our water during the warmer months is generally greater than during cooler months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation systems  swimming pools  cooling systems and other outside water use 
throughout the year  and particularly during typically warmer months  demand will vary with temperature and rainfall levels 
in the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal  or if there is more rainfall than normal  the demand for our water may decrease and adversely affect our revenues 

table of contents declining per customer residential water usage may reduce our revenues  financial condition and results of operations in future years 
a trend of declining per customer residential water usage in connecticut has been observed for the last several years  which we would attribute to increased water conservation  including the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances among residential users 
our regulated business is heavily dependent on revenue generated from rates we charge to our residential customers for the volume of water they use 
the rate we charge for our water is regulated by the dpuc and we may not unilaterally adjust our rates to reflect changes in demand 
declining volume of residential water usage may have a negative impact on our operating revenues in the future if regulators do not reflect any usage declines in the rate setting design process 
potential regulatory changes or drought conditions may impact our ability to serve our current and future customers demand for water and our financial results 
we depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and future demands of our customers 
changes in regulatory requirements could affect our ability to utilize existing supplies and or secure new sources  as required 
insufficient supplies or an interruption in our water supply could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
although not occurring in  drought conditions could interfere with our sources of water supply and could adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our existing and future customers 
an interruption in our water supply could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  governmental restrictions on water usage during drought conditions may result in a decreased demand for our water  even if our water reserves are sufficient to serve our customers during these drought conditions  which may adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
we are increasingly dependent on the continuous and reliable operation of our information technology systems 
we rely on our information technology systems in connection with the operation of our business  especially with respect to customer service and billing  accounting and  in some cases  the monitoring and operation of our treatment  storage and pumping facilities 
a loss of these systems or major problems with the operation of these systems could affect our operations and have a significant material adverse effect on our results of operations 
with the implementation of the company s new enterprise resource planning erp system  the company delayed customer billings in order to verify the integrity of the system and the accuracy of those bills prior to mailing 
as a result  some billings and consequently  cash receipts were delayed 
the company has increased its utilization of its lines of credit during this period 
our operations  including plans to continue investment in new infrastructure  were not impacted 
the company has returned to normal billing and collection processes and does not anticipate delays in billing or collection in subsequent periods 
the delay in billing contributed to the increase in the company s bad debt expense for the year of approximately  due to the reserve policy based upon aging of the receivables 
the company fully anticipates that the reserve will return to more historical levels over the first quarter of the failure of  or the requirement to repair  upgrade or dismantle  any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we own and operate dams throughout the state of connecticut 
while the company maintains robust dam maintenance and inspection programs  a failure of any of those dams could result in injuries and damage to residential and or commercial property downstream for which we may be responsible  in whole or in part 
the failure of a dam could also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
any losses or liabilities incurred due to the failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates  and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates 
any failure of our reservoirs  storage tanks  mains or distribution networks could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation 
connecticut water distributes water through an extensive network of mains and stores water in reservoirs and storage tanks located across connecticut 
a failure of major mains  reservoirs  or tanks could result in injuries and damage to residential and or commercial property for which we may be responsible  in whole or in part 
the failure of major mains  reservoirs or tanks may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our water distribution network in order to conduct repairs 
such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water delivery requirements prescribed by governmental regulators  including the dpuc  and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  cash flow  liquidity and reputation 
any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates  and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates 
any future acquisitions we may undertake may involve risks and uncertainties 
an important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition and integration of water systems in order to move into new service areas and to broaden our current service areas 
as of the date of this filing  the connecticut water company now serves more than  customers  or a population of over  people  in connecticut towns 
we will not be able to acquire other businesses if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates 
it is our intent  when practical  to integrate any businesses we acquire with our existing operations 
the negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired businesses could require us to incur significant costs and cause diversion of our management time and resources 
future acquisitions by us could result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities  incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  failure to have effective internal control over financial reporting  fluctuations in quarterly results  and other acquisition related expenses 
some or all of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business as well as our ability to finance our business and comply with regulatory requirements 
the businesses we acquire in the future may not achieve sales and profitability that would justify our investment and any difficulties we encounter in the integration process  including the integration of controls necessary for internal control and financial reporting  could interfere with our operations  reduce our operating margins and adversely affect our internal controls 
in addition  as consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries  the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our ability to grow through acquisitions 

table of contents water supply contamination may adversely affect our business 
our water supplies are subject to contamination  including contamination from the development of naturally occurring compounds  chemicals in groundwater systems  pollution resulting from man made sources  such as methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe  and possible terrorist attacks 
in the event that our water supply is contaminated  we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the flow of water from an uncontaminated water source or provide additional treatment 
we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities  or development of new treatment methods 
if we are unable to substitute water supply from an uncontaminated water source  or to adequately treat the contaminated water source in a cost effective manner  there may be an adverse effect on our revenues  operating results and financial condition 
the costs we incur to decontaminate a water source or an underground water system could be significant and could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition and may not be recoverable in rates 
we could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our water supplies or other environmental damage 
for example  private plaintiffs have the right to bring personal injury or other toxic tort claims arising from the presence of hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies 
our insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover the costs of these claims 
the need to increase security may continue to increase our operating costs 
in addition to the potential pollution of our water supply as described above  we have taken steps to increase security measures at our facilities and heighten employee awareness of threats to our water supply 
we have also tightened our security measures regarding the delivery and handling of certain chemicals used in our business 
we have and will continue to bear increased costs for security precautions to protect our facilities  operations and supplies 
these costs may be significant 
we are currently not aware of any specific threats to our facilities  operations or supplies  however  it is possible that we would not be in a position to control the outcome of terrorist events should they occur 
the accuracy of our judgments and estimates about financial and accounting matters will impact our operating results and financial condition 
we make certain estimates and judgments in preparing our financial statements regarding  among others the number of years to depreciate certain assets  amounts to set aside for uncollectible accounts receivable and uninsured losses  our legal exposure and the appropriate accrual for claims  including medical and workers compensation claims  future costs for pensions and other post retirement benefit obligations  and possible tax allowances 
the quality and accuracy of those estimates and judgments will have an impact on our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  we must estimate unbilled revenues and costs at the end of each accounting period 
if our estimates are not accurate  we will be required to make an adjustment in a future period 
key employee turnover may adversely affect our operating results 
our success depends significantly on the continued individual and collective contributions of our management team 
the loss of the services of any member of our senior management team or the inability to hire and retain experienced management personnel could harm our operating results

in certain cases  our water company may be a party to limited contractual arrangements for the provision of water supply from neighboring utilities 
we believe that our properties are in good operating condition 
water mains are located  for the most part  in public streets and  in a few instances  are located on land that we own in fee simple and or land utilized pursuant to easement right  most of which are perpetual and adequate for the purpose for which they are held 
the net utility plant of the company at december  was solely owned by connecticut water 
connecticut water s net utility plant balance as of december  was  approximately million more than the balance of net utility plant as of december   due primarily to normal plant additions and construction spending related to infrastructure improvements 
sources of water supply owned  maintained  and operated by connecticut water include eighteen reservoirs and eighty nine well fields 
in addition  connecticut water has agreements with various neighboring water utilities to provide water  at negotiated rates  to our water systems 
collectively  these sources have the capacity to deliver approximately fifty two million gallons of potable water daily to the thirteen major operating systems in the following table 
in addition to the principal systems identified  connecticut water owns  maintains  and operates forty nine small  non interconnected satellite and consecutive water systems that  combined  have the ability to deliver about two million gallons of additional water per day to their respective systems 
for some small consecutive water systems  purchased water may comprise substantially all of the total available supply of the system

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition executive overview the company is a non operating holding company  whose income is derived from the earnings of its three active wholly owned subsidiary companies the connecticut water company connecticut water  new england water utility services  inc newus  and chester realty company chester realty 
in  approximately of the company s net income was attributable to the water activities of its largest subsidiary  connecticut water  a regulated water utility with  customers throughout connecticut towns  as of december  the rates charged for service by connecticut water are subject to review and approval by the connecticut department of public utility control dpuc 
in the mid s  connecticut water made a conscious decision to minimize its reliance on rate increase requests to drive its financial performance 
instead  it relied upon unregulated operations and cost containment to grow the earnings of the company without seeking higher rates 
after a successful extended period of meeting these objectives  it became clear in that a rate increase was needed to continue to provide shareholder value through increased earnings 
the company decided to return to the more traditional model of recurring rate increase filings to efficiently collect its cost of both annual expenses and its investment in the infrastructure of the regulated business 
in  the connecticut water communicated to its customers  regulators and shareholders that it expected to seek rate relief on a more recurring basis 
on january   connecticut water filed a rate application with the dpuc  requesting a multi year increase totaling million above pro forma test year revenues  including the aforementioned wica surcharge  over a three year period 
on july   the dpuc issued its final decision in the case  granting an increase in revenues of million  or approximately  over pro forma test year revenues 
the dpuc approved a return on equity of 
the new rates became effective for services rendered on or after july   at which point all previously approved infrastructure surcharges were folded into customers base charges 
the dpuc did not approve connecticut water s multi year requested increase of million  million was associated with the initial year 
the dpuc chose to not consider years and included in connecticut water s application 
the final decision does not preclude connecticut water from seeking increased rates for future years as part of a new general rate filing should it choose to do so 
recognizing the importance of timely infrastructure replacement and improvement  the company  along with other investor owned regulated water companies in the state  campaigned for the passage of the water infrastructure and conservation adjustment wica act in the connecticut general assembly  which was adopted in wica allows the company to add a surcharge to customers bills  subject to an expedited review and approval by the dpuc and no more than twice a year  to reflect the replacement of certain types of aging utility plant  principally water mains  meters  service lines and water conservation related investments 
on october   connecticut water filed a wica application with the dpuc requesting a surcharge to customer bills representing investments of approximately million in wica related projects that were placed into service after april  the date the dpuc recognized for rate base purposes during the rate case 
on december   the dpuc approved the surcharge effective for all bills issued after january  the company has and will continue to focus on minimizing operating costs that are passed along to its customers without sacrificing the quality service it values and the customers demand 
at the same time  the company will continue to employ its current strategy of timely collection of appropriate costs and a fair rate of return for its shareholders through appropriate rates for its regulated water service 
as part of a broader organizational review  beginning in july  the company examined both its regulated and unregulated operations to ensure that it is maximizing the company s financial results while maintaining the high quality water and service our customers have come to expect 
during the third quarter the company determined that a targeted reduction in workforce was appropriate 
the company eliminated approximately positions that centered on traditional managerial  officer and overhead positions 
the company did not eliminate positions in direct service of its customers 
the company recorded a one time pre tax charge of approximately  related to this organizational review 
this charge represents the aggregate severance benefit provided to the employees leaving the company  legal costs associated with the review and out placement services provided to the effected employees 
the company will continue to evaluate all segments of its business and will make additional changes if warranted 
the company prides itself on being able to help water systems that do not have the resources to deliver the best water possible to their customers 
on february   the company announced the acquisition of the assets of water systems in killingworth and mansfield  connecticut 
these acquisitions added approximately customers to the company 
the system acquired in killingworth had water quality issues that the previous owners were unable to address 
the company designed  purchased  and installed a uranium treatment system that was brought on line in october since the treatment system went on line  uranium has not been detected at the system 
in  connecticut water added private well owners in our existing service territories 
in and beyond  the company will continue its efforts to tie in private well owners whose homes are in close proximity to our mains 
additionally  the company will continue to work with developers to encourage public water use for new residential construction within connecticut water s service areas 
while the company plans to file timely rate cases  continue to make acquisitions and  in the future  utilize the wica adjustment to allow for more timely recovery of investment in utility plant  it will also look to newus to increase its earnings in the unregulated business 
the company will continue to seek out maintenance and service contracts with new customers and renew existing contracts that have proven to be beneficial to the company  as well as to continue the expansion of the linebacker program 
in january  newus acquired the assets of home service usa 
prior to the acquisition  home service usa offered connecticut water customers coverage for failure of home plumbing and septic drainage lines 
newus agreed to purchase the right to provide the service to connecticut water customers and began offering its own comparable coverage 
as part of the agreement  home service usa will not offer its products to connecticut water customers for a period of ten years 
the new products offered by newus have been integrated into the linebacker program 
during  the company entered into discussions to sell approximately acres of land to the town of plymouth  ct for open space purposes 
the town was awarded a watershed and open space grant from the connecticut department of environmental protection to assist in purchasing the land 
this transaction will allow the company to receive financial benefit by disposing of property that is no longer needed for public water supply purposes while at the same time supporting environmental stewardship by ensuring the property is permanently maintained as open space 
the company expects the transaction  if approved by the town s residents and the dpuc  to be completed in late or early 
table of contents regulatory matters and inflation the company  like all other businesses  is affected by inflation  most notably by the continually increasing costs required to maintain  improve  and expand its service capabilities 
the cumulative effect of inflation over time results in significantly higher operating costs and facility replacement costs  which must be recovered from future cash flows 
connecticut water s ability to recover its increased expenses and or investment in utility plant is dependent on the rates we charge our customers 
changes to these rates must be approved by the dpuc through formal rate proceedings 
due to the subjectivity of certain items involved in the process of establishing rates such as customer usage  future customer growth  inflation  and allowed return on investment  we have no assurance that we will be able to raise our rates to a level we consider appropriate  or to raise rates at all  through any future rate proceeding 
connecticut water is also subject to environmental and water quality regulations  which are continually modified and refined to ensure the safety of the company s water sources and  ultimately  the public s health 
costs to comply with environmental and water quality regulations are substantial 
the costs to comply with future changes in state or federal regulations  which could require us to modify current filtration facilities and or construct new ones  or to replace any reduction of the safe yield from any of our current sources of supply  could be substantial 
while there can be no guarantee that all expenditures related to increased regulation will be recoverable in rate proceedings  the company believes that the regulatory environment in connecticut would allow prudent expenditures to be recovered in rates 
to date  the company has never had any costs associated with water quality and environmental spending refused in a general rate proceeding 
the company believes that it is in compliance with current regulations  but the regulations are subject to change at any time 
during  the company incurred approximately million in capital expenditures on safe drinking water act projects 
the company expects to spend approximately million on safe water drinking act projects in  primarily to bring newly acquired systems up to the company s standards 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and as directed by the regulatory commissions to which the company s subsidiaries are subject 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies 
the company believes the following policies and estimates are critical to the presentation of its consolidated financial statements 
public utility regulation financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc regulated operations fasb asc  requires cost based  rate regulated enterprises such as connecticut water to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in their financial statements 
the state regulators  through the rate regulation process  can create regulatory assets that result when costs are allowed for ratemaking purposes in a period after the period in which costs would be charged to expense by an unregulated enterprise 
the balance sheet includes regulatory assets and liabilities as appropriate  primarily related to income taxes and post retirement benefit costs 
the company believes  based on current regulatory circumstances  that the regulatory assets recorded are likely to be recovered and that its use of regulatory accounting is appropriate and in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc revenue recognition the company s accounting policies regarding revenue recognition by segment are as follows water activities most of our water customers are billed quarterly  with the exception of larger commercial and industrial customers  as well as public and private fire protection customers who are billed monthly 
most customers  except fire protection customers  are metered 
revenues from metered customers are based on their water usage multiplied by approved  regulated rates and are earned when water is delivered 
public fire protection revenues are based on the length of the water main  and number of hydrants in service and are earned on a monthly basis 
private fire protection charges are based on the diameter of the connection to the water main 
connecticut water accrues an estimate for metered customers for the amount of revenues earned relating to water delivered but unbilled at the end of each quarter 
real estate transactions revenues are recorded when a sale or other transaction has been completed and title to the real estate has been transferred 
services and rentals revenues are recorded when the company has delivered the services called for by contractual obligation 
employee benefit plan accounting management evaluates the appropriateness of the discount rate through the modeling of a bond portfolio which approximates the pension and postretirement plan liabilities 
management further considers rates of high quality corporate bonds of approximate maturities as published by nationally recognized rating agencies consistent with the duration of the company s pension and postretirement plans 
the discount rate assumption we use to value our pension and postretirement benefit obligations has a material impact on the amount of expense we record in a given period 
our and pension expense was calculated using assumed discount rates of and  respectively 
our and post retirement welfare expense was calculated using assumed discount rates of and  respectively 
in  our pension and postretirement welfare expense will be calculated using assumed discount rates of and  respectively 
the following table shows how much a one percent change in our assumed discount rate would have changed our reported pension and postretirement expense increase decrease in pension expense increase decrease in postretirement expense increase in the discount rate decrease in the discount rate other assumptions that affect the costs associated with our benefit plans include the assumed rate of return on plan assets and the expected rate of compensation increase 
the company has assumed an return on plan investments for and and a and rate of compensation increase for our pension and post retirement welfare plans  in and  respectively 
the assumed health care trend rate was at december  and  respectively
