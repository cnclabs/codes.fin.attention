item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands  except per share amounts introduction the company financial results improved considerably compared to the company net income available to common shareholders was  the most significant aspect of the improvement was a decline in the provision for loan losses 
the company was able to generate net income of  while nonperforming assets trended lower throughout the year 
continued improvement in both areas is expected in management continues to focus on credit quality and reducing the level of nonperforming assets  but is also actively pursuing new lending opportunities 
investments in the infrastructure of the company have and will continue to improve our credit processes and are designed to provide the capacity for growth 
as the economic recovery continues  we want to be well positioned to take advantage of the business opportunities that will present themselves 
the sales and credit evaluation functions have been separated and will allow our front line bankers more time for business development 
a clearly defined credit function will focus on the underwriting of the new business opportunities 
resources have also been added to the compliance area to properly handle the unprecedented volume of new regulations applicable to the company operations 
west bank entered into a memorandum of understanding with the iowa department of banking and the fdic on april   due to examination results as of december  the details of the agreement are described in item of this filing 
on july   the company received notice from the federal reserve bank of chicago that it must request prior approval for the declaration or payment of common stock dividends which must be paid from current earnings  any increase in debt or issuance of trust preferred obligations  or the redemption of company stock 
the company believes it has and will continue to comply with the federal reserve requirements  and west bank has and will be able to continue to comply with the agreement without any substantial impact on operations or material impact on financial results 
the regulators approved a common stock dividend in december we anticipate the company will be profitable in the amount of the anticipated profit will depend  in large part  on the amount of loan losses we incur 
we anticipate loan losses will decline again in  but our loan portfolio still presents higher than normal risks 
a significant portion of our portfolio is comprised of loans secured by commercial real estate 
while we believe we have aggressively addressed declining real estate valuation issues when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  future changes in real estate valuations in and beyond remain uncertain 
the following discussion describes the consolidated operations of the company  including west bank  west bank wholly owned subsidiary wb funding corporation which owns an interest in smartypig  llc  and west bank percent owned subsidiary icd iv  llc 
the accounts of former subsidiary wb capital management inc wb capital are included in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods through the sale date of december  critical accounting policies this report is based on the company audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the financial information contained in these statements is based on the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
however  the preparation of these statements requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
the company significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
based on its consideration of accounting policies that involve the most complex and subjective estimates and judgments  management has identified its most critical accounting policies to be those related to asset impairment judgments  including fair value and other than temporary impairment otti of available for sale investment securities  the valuation of other real estate owned  and the allowance for loan losses 

table of contents securities available for sale are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of deferred income taxes 
the company evaluates each of its investment securities whose value has declined below amortized cost to determine whether the decline in fair value is otti 
the investment portfolio is evaluated for otti by segregating the portfolio into two segments and applying the appropriate otti model 
investment securities classified as available for sale are generally evaluated for otti under fasb asc  investments debt and equity securities 
however  certain purchased beneficial interests in securitized financial assets  including asset backed securities and collateralized debt obligations  that had credit ratings of below aa at the time of purchase are evaluated using the model outlined in fasb asc  beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
in determining otti under the fasb asc model  the review takes into consideration the severity and duration of the decline in fair value  the length of time expected for recovery  the financial condition of the issuer  and other qualitative factors  as well as the company lack of intent to sell the security or whether it is more likely than not the company will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery 
the second segment of the portfolio uses the otti guidance provided by fasb asc under the fasb asc model  the company compares the present value of the remaining cash flows as estimated at the preceding evaluation date to the current expected remaining cash flows 
an otti is deemed to have occurred if there has been an adverse change in the remaining expected future cash flows 
when otti occurs under either model  the amount of the otti recognized in earnings depends on whether the company intends to sell the security or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
if the company intends to sell or it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  the otti is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
if the company does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell before recovery of its amortized cost basis  the otti is separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors 
the amount of the total otti related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected  using the original yield as the discount rate  and is recognized in earnings 
the amount of the total otti related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income loss  net of applicable taxes 
the previous amortized cost basis less the otti recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment 
the assessment of whether an otti exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at the time 
other real estate owned includes real estate properties acquired through or in lieu of foreclosure 
properties are initially recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs 
after foreclosure  valuations are periodically performed by management by obtaining updated appraisals or other market information 
any subsequent writedowns are recorded as a charge to operations 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense 
loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that collectability of the principal is unlikely 
the company has policies and procedures for evaluating the overall credit quality of its loan portfolio  including timely identification of potential problem loans 
on a quarterly basis  management reviews the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses  incorporating a variety of risk considerations  both quantitative and qualitative 
quantitative factors include the company historical loss experience  delinquency and charge off trends  collateral values  known information about individual loans  and other factors 
qualitative factors include the general economic environment in the company market areas and the expected trend of those economic conditions 
while management uses the best information available to make its evaluation  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if there are significant changes in economic conditions or the other factors relied upon 
to the extent actual results differ from forecasts and management judgment  the allowance for loan losses may be greater or less than future charge offs 
results of operations compared to overview total net income available to common stockholders for the year ended december   was  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  the company return on average equity roe was percent compared to percent in the return on average assets roa was percent  compared to percent for the prior year 

table of contents net income from continuing operations was  for compared to a net loss of  for basic and diluted earnings loss per common share from continuing operations were and for the same periods  respectively 
the improvement in net income from continuing operations in compared to was due in substantial part to the  decline in the provision for loan losses during in addition  the loss included a one time non cash goodwill impairment at west bank of  noninterest income  exclusive of securities gains losses  increased by  compared to noninterest income for included  of service fees paid to west bank by smartypig  llc 
this fee was discontinued after the smartypig savings deposits were transferred to a larger financial institution 
the discontinuance of this fee should not materially impact future net income  because it was designed to reimburse west bank for the difference between the interest expense on the smartypig savings accounts and the interest income earned by investing those funds on a short term basis 
noninterest expense  exclusive of goodwill impairment  increased  over the increase included higher salary and benefit costs due in significant part to bonus accruals and profit sharing expense  increased other real estate owned expense due to writedowns of property values  and higher miscellaneous losses 
for the year ended december   the company efficiency ratio was percent  up from the prior year ratio of percent 
this ratio is computed by dividing noninterest expense excluding goodwill impairment and discontinued operations by the sum of tax equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income excluding securities gains and net impairment losses and discontinued operations 
the ratio for both years is significantly better than peer group averages  which are generally around percent according to data in the september bank holding company performance report  a report prepared by the federal reserve board division of banking supervision and regulation 
net interest income net interest income increased  to  for as the net interest margin improved to percent from percent in the rates paid on deposits and borrowings declined more than the yields on earning assets 
the average yield on earning assets declined basis points  while the average rate on interest bearing liabilities declined basis points

table of contents noninterest income the following table shows the variance from the prior year in the noninterest income categories shown in the consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  accounts within the other income category that represent significant variances are shown 
years ended december noninterest income change change service charges on deposit accounts debit card usage fees service fee from smartypig  llc n a trust services gains and fees on sales of residential mortgages increase in cash value of bank owned life insurance gain from bank owned life insurance other income visa mastercard income wire transfer fees all other income total other income total noninterest income service charges on deposit accounts declined primarily due to a reduction in overdraft and return check charges and a decline in commercial account fees 
in the last few years  customers have become more conscientious about monitoring their checking account balances to avoid overdraft and return check charges 
service charges on commercial accounts declined due to revised fee schedules as a result of consolidating and simplifying the product offerings 
debit card usage fees continued to increase in as the reward me checking and other checking product customers expanded the use of this convenient payment method 
we expect these fees to decline in the future due to implementation of provisions of the dodd frank act 
the service fee from smartypig  llc was established to compensate west bank for maintaining the rate paid on the smartypig savings deposits higher than that of other internet based savings accounts 
this fee was discontinued in the third quarter when these deposits were transferred to a larger institution on july  trust fees increased in due to new business and higher asset values due to gains in the stock market 
revenue from the sales of residential mortgages sold into the secondary market improved in due to higher average gains per loan 
the volume of loans sold into the secondary market during was stable compared to the volume of home sales in our markets remains low  but many consumers took advantage of the historically low rates to refinance existing mortgage loans 
this source of revenue is expected to remain strong in the increase in cash value of bank owned life insurance was due to slightly higher yields 
west bank received tax exempt income from a gain on life insurance proceeds as the result of the death of one of its retired officers in the third quarter of and one of its officers in the first quarter of investment securities gains losses during  west bank securities impairment losses totaling were recognized through earnings 
those losses consisted of a otti on one single issuer trust preferred security tps issued by old second bancorp  inc old second in the second quarter and a credit loss on a pooled tps during the third quarter 
upon the withdrawal of an exchange offer for old second  management decided to eliminate the potential for a total loss on this security and sold it for a loss of during the third quarter 
offsetting this realized loss were gains on sales of municipal and other securities with total net gains of recognized for the year 
during  west bank investment securities impairment losses totaling  were recognized through earnings 
those losses consisted of  on five single issuer tpss  a otti credit loss on a pooled tps  and a loss on a unit trust comprised of the common stock of several community banks and bank holding companies 
management liquidated certain bonds during the second half of in order to reduce the credit risk in the west bank investment portfolio 
trust preferred  corporate  and selected agency and municipal bonds were sold resulting in net gains totaling  for the year ended december

accruals for both of these were reinstated as a result of improved operating results compared to these accruals were calculated at approximately percent of the potential maximum payout 
the bonus accrual included of hiring incentives paid to two new members of senior management as consideration for joining the company 
most salaries were frozen at levels during the first half of the board ended the salary freeze for the second half of and an average salary increase of percent was awarded during the third quarter 
additional employees were hired to enable customer contact personnel to spend more time on business development while others focus on credit underwriting and compliance 
the majority of the decline in occupancy expense was due to a second quarter one time buyout for unused space leased by the company 
depreciation expense on furniture and equipment has also declined from the prior year as older assets have become fully depreciated 
fdic insurance expense was higher in due to a rate increase  higher average deposit balances during the first seven months of the year  and an increase in the cost of the fdic temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp 
fdic expense for included a second quarter emergency special assessment which was imposed on all insured institutions 
fdic insurance expense for is expected to decline due to a reduction in announced rates and a change in the assessment base from total average deposits to total average assets less tangible capital 
other real estate owned expense increased primarily as a result of property writedowns totaling  in and in miscellaneous losses included of total impairment of the company investment in a renewable energy closed end fund 
the investment consisted of startup expenses for a publicly traded closed end fund formed to invest in companies involved in the renewable energy sector 
the investment was originally made in support of the company former subsidiary wb capital management inc  which was to be the fund investment manager 
miscellaneous losses also included an estimated liability of established for secondary market loans sold through the federal home loan bank fhlb mortgage partnership finance program mpf 
west bank has agreed to guarantee the payment of any realized losses that exceed the fhlb first loss account for mortgages delivered through the program 

table of contents the goodwill impairment consisted of writing off all goodwill at west bank  which totaled  the impairment analysis was completed at an interim period in due to the company common stock price falling to levels below book value 
insurance expense increased compared to the prior year due to increases in premiums 
marketing expense declined due to cost containment efforts compared to consulting fees declined as fees paid in conjunction with the company search for a new chief executive officer in were less than the costs for hiring consulting firms to assist in evaluating goodwill for impairment and to assist with investment securities valuations 
director fees have increased due to additional meetings in conjunction with hiring the new chief executive officer and an agreement to pay the new chairman a monthly fee for his ongoing operational guidance 
deposit operations expense declined significantly as costs associated with opening accounts for the smartypig savings program were transferred to another provider in the third quarter of this portion of this expense category was eliminated once west bank involvement with the program ended 
west bank service charges and fees paid grew in as a result of retaining an outside party to assist in managing west bank investment portfolio 
other expense declined due to cost containment efforts throughout income taxes benefits the company records a provision for income tax expense benefits currently payable  along with a provision for those taxes payable or refundable in the future 
such deferred taxes arise from differences in the timing of certain items for financial statement reporting compared to income tax reporting 
the effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to tax exempt interest income  the tax exempt increase in cash value of bank owned life insurance  gain from bank owned life insurance  disallowed interest expense  and state income taxes 
for both years  the effective tax rate was also impacted by west bank investment in a qualified community development entity  which generated a federal new market tax credit 
the credit  which totals  is being recognized over a seven year period 
the effective rate of income tax expense benefit as a percent of income loss before income taxes from continuing operations was an expense of percent for  compared to a benefit of percent for the federal income tax expense benefit was approximately  and  for and  respectively  while state income tax expense benefit was approximately and  respectively

noninterest income  exclusive of securities gains losses  increased by compared to the increase was due to of gain received in the first quarter of from a bank owned life insurance policy as the result of the death of a west bank officer and an increase of in gains and fees on the sales of residential mortgages sold into the secondary market 
offsetting this growth was an decline in service charges on deposit accounts primarily due to lower returned check charges 

table of contents goodwill impairment was reviewed as of june   because the company common stock traded at a market price of less than its per share book value 
with the assistance of a third party valuation firm  management prepared an estimate of the fair value of a percent controlling marketable interest in the outstanding stock of west bank 
a combination of the income and market approaches was used in determining the fair value 
under the income approach  the primary factor considered was the ability of west bank to generate future cash flows 
a discount rate was estimated by utilizing the build up method which factors in the following components a risk free rate of return  an equity risk premium  an industry risk premium or discount  a size premium  and risk associated specifically with west bank 
a discount rate of percent was then applied to projected future cash flows 
under the market approach  stock market data regularly published on publicly traded companies considered to be similar to west bank were utilized in determining market value 
the two indicated values were then weighted to represent the relative importance a market participant might reasonably be expected to place on the results of each method 
based on that analysis  an impairment of  or all of the goodwill recorded on west bank balance sheet  was taken in the second quarter of noninterest expense  exclusive of goodwill impairment  increased  over the increase included the previously mentioned increase in fdic insurance expense  including a one time special assessment  a increase in salaries and employee benefits  a increase in occupancy costs  a increase in deposit operations expense  and a increase in costs associated with nonperforming assets

table of contents net interest income the company largest component of net income is net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on earning assets  consisting primarily of loans and investments  and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  consisting of deposits and borrowings 
fluctuations in net interest income can result from the combination of changes in the balances of asset and liability categories and changes in interest rates 
interest rates earned and paid are also affected by general economic conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  and by competitive factors  government policies  and the action of regulatory authorities

loan pricing in the company market areas remains competitive  while the demand for new loans has been stagnant 
the average balance of investment securities in grew  compared to  while the yield fell basis points

as of december   existing unrealized losses of  are considered to be temporary in nature due to market interest rate fluctuations and illiquid markets  not estimated cash flows  and the company has the ability and the intent to hold the related securities with unrealized losses for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery  which may be at maturity 
all except one of the state and political subdivisions investments are with iowa communities and all are considered to have acceptable credit risks 
mortgage backed securities consist of residential mortgage pass through securities guaranteed by gnma or issued by fnma and real estate mortgage investment conduits guaranteed by fhlmc or gnma 
the debt obligations were all within the credit ratings acceptable under west bank investment policy 
as of december   the tables above include a pooled tps  alesco preferred funding x  ltd  that is otti and which has been placed on nonaccrual status 
the accrual of interest on an investment security is discontinued when a security is deemed otti 
the company engaged an independent consulting firm to assist in the valuation of this security 
based on that valuation  management determined the security had an estimated fair value of  at december  the methodology for determining the appropriate discount rate for a tps for purposes of determining fair value combines an evaluation of current market yields for comparable corporate and structured credit products with an evaluation of the risks associated with the tps cash flows in question 
more specifically  the market based yield indicators are used as a baseline for determining appropriate discount rates  and the resulting discount rates are adjusted on the basis of credit and structural analysis of specific tps instruments 
the primary focus is on the returns a fixed income investor would require in order to allocate capital on a risk adjusted basis 
however  due to the fact that there is currently no active market for this pooled tps  the focus is on market yields for stand alone tpss issued by banks  thrifts  and insurance companies  and for which there are active and liquid markets 
a series of adjustments are made to reflect the differences that nevertheless exist between these products both credit and structural and  most importantly  to reflect idiosyncratic credit performance differences both actual and projected between these products and the underlying collateral in the specific tpss being valued 
importantly  as part of the analysis described above  consideration is given to the fact that structured instruments frequently exhibit leverage not present in stand alone instruments  and adjustments are made as necessary to reflect this additional risk 
as a result of this analysis and due to the fixed rate nature of the instrument contractual interest cash flows  a discount rate of libor a lifetime average all in discount rate of approximately was used for determination of fair value 
for purposes of determining any credit loss  projected cash flows were discounted at the original purchased yield of through march and then libor plus thereafter 

table of contents the consulting firm first evaluates the credit quality of each underlying issuer within the tps by reviewing a comprehensive database of financial information and or publicly filed financial statements 
on the basis of this information and a review of historical industry default data and current and near term operating conditions  default and recovery probabilities for each underlying issuer within the asset were estimated 
for issuers who had already defaulted  no recovery was assumed 
for deferring issuers  an assumption was made that the majority of deferring issuers will continue to defer and will eventually default 
each deferring issuer is reviewed on a case by case basis and  in some instances  a probability is assigned that the deferral will ultimately be cured 
the issuer specific assumptions are then aggregated into cumulative weighted average default  recovery  and prepayment probabilities 
the collateral prepayment assumptions were affected by the view that the terms and pricing of tpss and subordinated debt issued by banks and insurance companies were so aggressive that it is unlikely that such financing will become available in the foreseeable future 
therefore  the assumption was made that no collateral will prepay over the life of the tps 
in light of generally weak collateral credit performance and a challenging us credit and real estate environment  the assumptions generally imply a larger amount of issuer defaults during the next three years than that which had been experienced historically  and a gradual leveling off of defaults thereafter 
based on the valuation work performed  credit losses of and were recognized for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   the unrealized loss of  is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of taxes of  the company will continue to periodically estimate the present value of cash flows expected to be collected over the life of the security 
at december   the most significant risk of a future impairment charge relates to west bank investment in tpss of other banks 
as of year end  two tpss with a cost basis of  were valued at  as previously mentioned  management has concluded that only the pooled tps is otti 
any potential future loss that would be considered a credit loss or an increase in the amount of the unrealized loss attributed to credit  would negatively impact net income and regulatory capital  however  as previously noted  the fair market value adjustment at december   has already been recorded against equity 
as of december   the company did not have securities from a single issuer  except for the united states government or its agencies  which exceeded percent of consolidated stockholders equity

as of december   the majority of all loans were originated directly by west bank to borrowers within west bank principal market areas 
there were no non us loans outstanding during the years presented 
commercial loans consist primarily of loans to businesses for various purposes  including revolving lines to finance current operations  inventory and accounts receivable  and capital expenditure loans to finance equipment and other fixed assets 
these loans generally have short maturities  have either adjustable or fixed rates  and are either unsecured or secured by inventory  accounts receivable  and or fixed assets 

table of contents real estate loans include various types of loans for which west bank holds real property as collateral  and consist of loans on commercial properties and single and multifamily residences 
real estate loans are typically structured to mature every years with payments based on up to year amortization periods 
the majority of construction loans are to contractors and developers for construction of commercial buildings or residential real estate 
these loans typically have maturities of up to months 
west bank originates residential real estate loans for its portfolio and for sale in the secondary market for a fee 
consumer loans include loans extended to individuals for household  family  and other personal expenditures not secured by real estate 
the majority of west bank consumer lending is for vehicles  consolidation of personal debts  and household improvements 
the interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk  the amount of the loan  and the maturity of the loan 
competitive pressures  market interest rates  the availability of funds  and government regulation further influence the rate charged on a loan 
west bank follows a loan policy that has been approved by west bank board of directors 
the loan policy is reviewed at least annually and is updated as considered necessary 
the policy establishes lending limits  review criteria  and other guidelines  such as for loan administration and the allowance for loan losses 
loans are approved by west bank board of directors and or designated officers in accordance with the applicable guidelines and underwriting policies 
loans to any one borrower are limited by state banking laws 
loan officer lending authorities vary according to the individual loan officer experience and expertise

management is devoting a great deal of effort to monitoring these nonperforming assets  and west bank loan officers are in frequent contact with loan customers to execute workout strategies on any potential loan problems 
the accrual of interest on past due and other impaired loans is generally discontinued when loan payments are past due days or when  in the opinion of management  the borrower may be unable to make payments as they become due 
interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received 
generally  all payments received while a loan is on nonaccrual status are applied to the principal balance of the loan 
in certain cases  interest may continue to accrue on loans past due more than days when the value of the collateral is sufficient to cover both the principal amount of the loan and accrued interest and the loan is in the process of collection 
interest income on troubled debt restructured loans tdr is recognized pursuant to the terms of the new loan agreement 
a tdr may be reported in the nonaccrual category if it is not performing in accordance with its revised terms 
interest income on other impaired loans is monitored and based upon the terms of the underlying loan agreement 
however  the recorded net investment in impaired loans  including accrued interest  is limited to the present value of the expected cash flows of the impaired loan or the observable fair market value of the loan collateral 
outstanding loans of  were placed on nonaccrual status during charge offs of  were recorded in related to nonaccrual loans and  was transferred to other real estate owned 
a loan may be removed from nonaccrual status when payments have resumed and it is reasonable to expect continued payment performance 
for the years ended december    and  interest income that would have been recorded during the nonaccrual period under the original terms of such loans was approximately   and  respectively 
a loan may be considered a tdr loan when the interest rate is reduced below that of a new loan with comparable risk or the term is extended beyond the original maturity date because of the inability of the borrower to service the loan at market terms 
the payment history of the customer  along with a current analysis of its cash flows  is used to determine the restructured terms 
underwriting procedures are similar to those of new loan originations and renewals of performing loans in that current financial statements and tax returns are obtained and analyzed 
a current assessment of collateral is performed 
the approval process for tdrs is the same as that for new loans 
the tdrs with extended terms are accounted for as impaired until ongoing performance is established 
any tdr with an interest rate concession remains in tdr status until paid off 
as shown in the table above  tdrs totaling  were transferred to nonaccrual during the average balance of all impaired loans during was approximately  interest income recognized on impaired loans in and was approximately  and  respectively  and was immaterial in

none of these loans were in default at the end of the year 
it is not now possible to predict the degree of problems these loans may develop 
however  west bank is closely monitoring each of them 
the composition of other real estate owned as of december   is shown in the following table 
construction  land development  and other land family residential properties multifamily commercial properties the company is actively marketing the assets included in the previous table 
unfortunately  demand for commercial real estate and development land remains weak 
valuations of other real estate owned are periodically performed by management so that the properties are carried at current market value less estimated disposal costs 
market values are determined by obtaining updated appraisals or other market information 
the construction and land development category includes six properties in the des moines metropolitan area  one property in the iowa city market  one property in missouri  and one property in arkansas 
one of the des moines properties was sold in january the family properties consist of seven homes 
the multifamily category consists of a unit townhome project in arkansas  with of the units currently rented 
the commercial properties consist of five properties  all of which are commercial facilities 

table of contents summary of the allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses represents charges made to earnings to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is management best estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
factors considered in establishing an appropriate allowance include an assessment of the financial condition of the borrower  a realistic determination of value and adequacy of underlying collateral  the condition of the local economy and the condition of the specific industry of the borrower  an analysis of the levels and trends of loan categories  and a review of delinquent and classified loans 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated quarterly by management and reviewed by west bank board of directors 
this evaluation focuses on factors such as specific loan reviews  changes in the components of the loan portfolio given the current and forecasted economic conditions  and historical loss experience 
any one of the following conditions may result in the review of a specific loan concern about whether the customer cash flow or net worth is sufficient to repay the loan  delinquency status  criticism of the loan in a regulatory examination  the suspension of interest accrual  or other factors  including whether the loan has other special or unusual characteristics that suggest special monitoring is warranted 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  further reduction in the carrying amounts of loans may be necessary based on changes in circumstances or later acquired information 
furthermore  changes in future economic activity are always uncertain 
identifiable sectors within the general economy are subject to additional volatility  which at any time may have a substantial impact on the loan portfolio 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the estimated losses on loans 
such agencies may require west bank to recognize additional losses based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination 

table of contents change in the allowance for loan losses west bank policy is to charge off loans when  in management opinion  the loan is deemed uncollectible  although concerted efforts are made to maximize future recoveries 
the following table summarizes activity in the company allowance for loan losses by loan segment for the years indicated  including amounts of loans charged off  amounts of recoveries  additions to the allowance charged to income  and related ratios

the net charge off ratio for was percent  a significant improvement compared to  which was a historical high for the company 
according to the september bank holding company performance report prepared by the federal reserve board division of banking supervision and regulation  the percentage of net charge offs to average loans for all banks with total assets between billion and billion was percent for the first nine months of commercial charge offs in included  related to eight customers  including additional charge offs for a customer who had a fraud committed against his company during factors that are considered when determining the adequacy of the allowance include loan concentrations  loan growth  the economic outlook  and historical losses 
the company concentration risks include geographic concentration in central iowa 
the local economy is comprised primarily of service industries and state and county governments 

table of contents west bank has a significant portion of its loan portfolio in commercial real estate loans  commercial lines of credit  commercial term loans  and construction or land development loans 
west bank typical commercial borrower is a small or medium sized  privately owned iowa business person or entity 
west bank commercial loans typically have greater credit risks than residential mortgage or consumer loans  because they often have larger balances and repayment usually depends on the borrowers successful business operations 
commercial loans also involve additional risks  because they generally are not fully repaid over the loan period and  thus  usually require refinancing or a large payoff at maturity 
when the economy turns downward  commercial borrowers may not be able to repay their loans and the value of their assets  which are usually pledged as collateral  may decrease rapidly and significantly 
although management believes that the real estate markets in which west bank makes loans are not as depressed as in some other parts of the country  we believe that real estate related credit risks continue to be higher than normal in our markets 
the current economic conditions in west bank market areas continue to put negative pressure on our existing loan customers and are limiting our ability to make attractive new loans 
nonperforming assets have continued to decline throughout we are experiencing changes in the components of nonperforming assets as certain loans move from nonaccrual status to other real estate owned to ultimate disposition 
the amounts being realized from the sale of other real estate owned have been reasonably close to the carrying value  which indicates the valuation process for other real estate owned has validity 
breakdown of allowance for loan losses by category the following table sets forth information concerning the company allocation of the allowance for loan losses by segment as of the dates indicated 
amount amount amount amount amount balance at end of period applicable to commercial real estate construction  land  and land development family residential first mortgages home equity commercial consumer and other loans percent of loans in each category to total loans 
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses is dependent upon the change in balances outstanding in the various categories  the historical net loss experience by category  which can vary over time  and management assessment of economic factors that may influence potential losses in the loan portfolio 
prior to  the historical experience factor was calculated using a three year average 
that average was updated once per year at the end of each calendar year 
in  that calculation was modified to use a rolling quarter average 
it was felt that by using a rolling quarter average  the most recent charge off experience is factored into the analysis sooner 
the allocation of the allowance includes specific reserves of  in the commercial category for three borrowers   in the construction  land  and land development category for two borrowers  for one residential mortgage customer  and in the consumer category for one borrower 
deposits the company primary source of funds is customer deposits 
total deposits as of december   were  a reduction of percent compared to the end of the decline was primarily in savings and certificates of deposit 
savings deposits declined  primarily due to the transfer of the smartypig related deposits 
certificates of deposit declined  compared to december   with the majority of the reduction in certificate of deposit account registry service cdars deposits due to the decision to let west bank wholesale cdars deposits mature  and a decline in commercial cdars balances 
cdars is a program that coordinates  on a reciprocal basis  a network of banks to spread out deposits exceeding the fdic insurance coverage limits to numerous institutions in order to provide insurance coverage for all participating deposits 

table of contents while approximately percent of west bank total certificates of deposit mature in the next year  it is anticipated that a majority of these certificates will be renewed 
rate sensitive certificates of deposit in excess of experience somewhat higher volatility with regard to renewal volume as west bank adjusts rates based upon funding needs 
in december  management was utilizing wholesale deposits of  as a source of funding 
of the total wholesale deposits  approximately  are certificates of deposit which mature in in the event a substantial volume of certificates is not renewed  management believes the company has sufficient liquid assets and borrowing lines to fund significant runoff 
a sustained reduction in deposit volume would have a significant negative impact on the company operations and liquidity

off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  west bank commits to extend credit in the form of loan commitments and standby letters of credit in order to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these commitments expose west bank to varying degrees of credit and market risks in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and are subject to the same credit policies as are loans recorded on the balance sheets 
west bank exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
west bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
as of december  and  west bank had commitments to extend credit of approximately  on both of these dates and standby letters of credit of approximately  and  respectively 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
west bank evaluates each customer creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained is based on management credit evaluation of the party 
collateral held varies  but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property and equipment  residential real estate  and commercial properties 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by west bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
collateral held varies as specified above  and is required in instances the company deems necessary 
in the event the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party  west bank would be required to fund the commitment 
the maximum potential amount of future payments west bank could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount disclosed above 
if a commitment is funded  west bank would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer 
at december  and  no amounts had been recorded as liabilities for west bank potential obligations under these guarantees 

table of contents in february   and  west bank executed mpf master commitments the commitments with the fhlb of des moines to deliver mortgage loans and to guarantee the payment of any realized losses that exceed the fhlb first loss account for mortgages delivered under the commitments 
west bank receives credit enhancement fees from the fhlb for providing this guarantee and continuing to assist in managing the credit risk of the mpf program mortgage loans 
the term of the current commitment and guarantee per the master commitment is through march  west bank expects to enter into a new commitment upon the expiration of the current commitment 
at december   any liability represented by the present value of the credit enhancement fees less any expected losses in the mortgages delivered under the commitments was approximately residential mortgage loans sold to investors in the secondary market are sold with varying recourse provisions 
essentially  all loan sales agreements require the repurchase of a mortgage loan by the seller in situations such as  breach of representation  warranty  or covenant  untimely document delivery  false or misleading statements  failure to obtain certain certificates or insurance  unmarketability  etc 
certain loan sales agreements contain repurchase requirements based on payment related defects that are defined in terms of the number of days months since the purchase  the sequence number of the payment  and or the number of days of payment delinquency 
based on the specific terms stated in the agreements of investor purchasing residential mortgage loans from west bank  the company had approximately  and  of sold residential mortgage loans with recourse provisions still in effect at december  and  respectively 
west bank did not repurchase any loans from secondary market investors under the terms of loan sale agreements during the years ended december  and in the opinion of management  the risk of recourse and the subsequent requirement of loan repurchase to west bank is not significant  and accordingly  the only liability established relates to loans sold under the fhlb mpf program 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth the balance of contractual obligations by maturity period as of december  payments due by period total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years deposits federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase other short term borrowings subordinated notes fhlb advances operating lease commitments total liquidity and capital resources the objective of liquidity management is to ensure the availability of sufficient cash flows to meet all financial commitments and to capitalize on opportunities for profitable business expansion 
the company principal source of funds is deposits 
other sources include loan principal repayments  proceeds from the maturity and sale of investment securities  federal funds purchased  repurchase agreements  advances from the fhlb  and funds provided by operations 
liquidity management is conducted on both a daily and a long term basis 
investments in liquid assets are adjusted based on expected loan demand  projected loan maturities and payments  expected deposit flows  and the objectives set by west bank asset liability management policy 
the company had liquid assets cash and cash equivalents of  at december   a decline of  from december  west bank had additional borrowing capacity available from the fhlb of approximately  at december  in addition  west bank has  in borrowing capacity available through unsecured and  available through secured federal funds lines of credit with correspondent banks 
west bank was not drawing on any of these lines of credit as of december  net cash from continuing operating activities contributed   and  to liquidity for the years   and  respectively 
the combination of high levels of potentially liquid assets  cash flows from operations  and additional borrowing capacity provide strong liquidity for the company as of december  
table of contents on december   the company received  from the united states treasury in exchange for  shares of cumulative senior preferred stock and a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock under the cpp 
the senior preferred shares qualify as tier capital for regulatory purposes  rank senior to common stock  and bear a cumulative dividend rate of five percent per annum for the first five years they are outstanding and a rate of nine percent per annum thereafter 
the board of directors and management believed it was prudent to participate in the cpp because i the cost of capital under the program was significantly lower than the cost of capital otherwise available to the company at the time  and ii despite being well capitalized  additional capital provided the company and west bank additional flexibility to meet future capital needs during the highly uncertain economic environment 
the board has begun evaluating options for redeeming the preferred stock  including selling additional common stock  using earnings  participating in the small business lending fund  or combinations of those alternatives 
no decisions have yet been made  but the company expects to redeem the preferred stock before december  the company total stockholders equity increased to  at december   from  at december  the change in equity was due to the net income less preferred and common stock dividends paid and lower accumulated other comprehensive loss due to lower unrealized losses in the investment portfolio 
at december   stockholders equity was percent of total assets  compared to percent at december  the company tangible common equity ratio was percent at december   compared to percent a year earlier 
no material capital expenditures or material changes in the capital resource mix are anticipated at this time  except for the possible repurchase of preferred stock 
the december   capital levels of the company exceed applicable regulatory guidelines to be considered well capitalized 
effects of new statements of financial accounting standards a discussion of the effects of new financial accounting standards and developments as they relate to the company is located in note of the following audited financial statements 
interest rate risk interest rate risk refers to the exposure to earnings and capital arising from changes in interest rates 
management objectives are to manage interest rate risk to work for consistent growth of earnings and capital 
interest rate risk management focuses on fluctuations in net interest income identified through computer simulations used to evaluate volatility  interest rate  spread  and volume assumptions 
this risk is quantified and compared against tolerance levels 
the company uses a purchased computer software simulation modeling program to measure its exposure to potential interest rate changes 
for various assumed hypothetical changes in market interest rates  this analysis measures the estimated change in net interest income 
another measure of interest rate sensitivity is the gap ratio 
this ratio indicates the amount of interest earning assets repricing within a given period in comparison to the amount of interest bearing liabilities repricing within the same period of time 
a gap ratio of indicates a matched position  in which case the effect on net interest income due to interest rate movements will be minimal 
a gap ratio of less than indicates that more liabilities than assets reprice within the time period  and a ratio greater than indicates that more assets reprice than liabilities 
the company gap ratio is shown on the following page 
inflation the primary impact of inflation on the company operations is increased asset yields  deposit costs  and operating overhead 
unlike most industries  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution performance than they would have on non financial companies 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
the effects of inflation can magnify the growth of assets and  if significant  require that equity capital increase at a faster rate than otherwise would be necessary 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company market risk is comprised primarily of interest rate risk arising from its core banking activities of lending and deposit taking 
interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates may adversely affect the company net interest income 
management continually develops and applies strategies to mitigate this risk 
management does not believe that the company primary market risk exposure and management of that exposure in materially changed compared to 
table of contents the following table presents the estimated change in net interest income for the coming twelve months under several scenarios of assumed interest rate changes for the rate shock levels shown scenario change basis points rising basis points rising basis points rising base as of december   the estimated effect of an immediate basis point increase in interest rates would cause the company net interest income to increase by approximately percent  or  in the estimated effect of an immediate decrease in rates is not reasonably calculable due to the current historically low interest rate environment 
because the majority of liabilities subject to interest rate movements in the short term are of the type that generally lag interest rate movements in the market  they do not change by the same magnitude in the short term as the change in market rates 
computations of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions 
actual values may differ from those projections set forth above 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the company may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity  expected cash flows  or repricing opportunities  and the resulting interest sensitivity gap  of the company interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the cumulative interest sensitivity gap at december  the expected maturities are presented on a contractual basis or  if more relevant  are based on projected call dates 
actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because of prepayment assumptions and early withdrawal of deposits 
months or less over through months over through years over years total interest earning assets loans securities available for sale federal funds sold and other short term investments federal home loan bank stock total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits savings  interest bearing demand  and money markets time federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreement to repurchase other short term borrowings long term borrowings total interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap per period cumulative interest sensitivity gap interest sensitivity gap ratio cumulative interest sensitivity gap ratio as of december   the company cumulative gap ratio for assets and liabilities repricing within one year was  meaning that the company is liability sensitive over the cumulative twelve month period 
in other words  more interest bearing liabilities will be subject to repricing within that time frame than interest earning assets 
however  the majority of the interest bearing liabilities subject to repricing within these time frames are savings  money market  and interest bearing demand deposits 
these types of deposits generally do not reprice as quickly or by the same magnitude as changes in other short term interest rates
