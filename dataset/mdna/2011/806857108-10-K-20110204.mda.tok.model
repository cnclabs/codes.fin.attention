item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements  including  without limitation  statements relating to our plans  strategies  objectives  expectations  intentions and resources 
such forward looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under item a 
risk factors of this report 
executive overview after two consecutive years of falling oil demand in and induced by the global economic recession  a strong recovery occurred in consumption averaged million barrels per day  including an all time peak of over million barrels per day in december  and made the year on year increase the second largest in three decades 
oil prices remained in the range of per barrel for much of  but recorded a spike above at the end of the year 
the major demand forecasts released during have continued to increase as a result of the improving economic outlook particularly in the developing economies 
on the supply side  the adherence to production quota by the opec countries helped keep the market balanced  although such adherence diminished slightly as the year progressed 
strength in non opec production  improvement in new project developments following the investment cuts in  and lower production costs helped provide additional assurance to the markets 
natural gas markets behaved differently 
decreasing gas demand during the recession  increasing unconventional gas production in north america  and the commissioning of a number of new large liquefied natural gas export facilities around the world led to an over supplied market with consequent pressure on spot prices 
within the united states the world s largest natural gas market natural gas storage levels have remained significantly above the five year range since march despite lower volumes of canadian gas imports and some power generation fuel switching from coal to gas 
with natural gas price forecasts from the energy information agency for slipping by nearly a third compared to initial projections made at the beginning of the year  an increasing portion of the drilling and completion activity in shale reservoirs has shifted to liquid and condensate rich plays in north america 
within this market  schlumberger oilfield services full year revenue in of billion grew versus  driven by recovery in the north america natural gas market through increasing demand and stronger pricing for pressure pumping services 
the north america area also benefited from greater activity in liquids rich plays in a number of basins 
offshore  the tragic macondo accident in the us gulf of mexico led to a shutdown in deepwater operations that severely impacted us offshore activity and led to slowdowns in other parts of the world  although these were being absorbed as the fourth quarter developed 
the middle east and asia area revenue climbed from a number of factors including increasing wireline logging and expanded ipm work 
latin america revenue grew by  with rapid growth in brazil overcoming weaker activity in mexico as poor weather  increasing security concerns and reduced client budgets impacted operations 
europe cis africa revenue decreased versus among the technologies  growth was primarily seen in well services activities  both in volume and in price although the acquisition of geoservices also contributed to the increase 
in addition to growing activity  results were underpinned through continuing market penetration of new technology services such as scope advanced logging while drilling measurements  scanner wireline technologies  and active coiled tubing services 
scanner services were boosted by the commercial introduction of the latest family member  the dielectric scanner tool  which was unveiled during the year 
as a unique industry service capable of measuring saturation in a variety of reservoir applications  the service completed a two year pilot project in saudi arabia targeted at reservoir monitoring  where logs were recorded in various fields  both on land and offshore  to assess water flooding sweep efficiency as an aid to field development planning 
in reservoir production  active real time coiled tubing services saw growth  particularly with active conveyance of wireline flow scanner production logging technology  and with fiber optic continuous measurements of temperature and pressure along the well bore 
growing deployment of integrated technologies such as these confirms exciting growth possibilities across the schlumberger technology portfolio particularly in horizontal and extended reach wells 
it was however drilling services that displayed early evidence of the opportunities provided by the acquisitions of geoservices and smith international that were announced during the first quarter 
these successes included the completion of a remote three well exploration project offshore greenland that used schlumberger technologies combined with smith and m i swaco products and services as well as geoservices mud logging 
in brazil  a similar combination of services helped one well record substantial increases in rates of penetration  while meeting all 
table of contents part ii  item directional drilling goals 
in this particular case the integrated nature of the bottomhole assembly demonstrated how technology optimization can impact performance in the high cost deepwater drilling environment 
a third such operation offshore indonesia further displayed the value of integrated bottomhole assemblies 
westerngeco revenue of billion in was lower than primarily as a result of lower marine activity and weaker pricing 
while land activity was also weaker  strong multiclient sales  particularly in the fourth quarter  were able to offset some of these effects 
new seismic technology scored some significant successes with penetration of marine single vessel  full azimuth coil shooting surveys into a number of the major offshore basins around the world 
coil shooting  unique to schlumberger  brings better illumination of complex pre salt  sub salt and sub basalt formations in a variety of environments 
the integration of geoservices and smith international proceeded smoothly during the year 
the complementary nature of many of the product and service lines concerned helped the process while a network of integration teams and area coordinators rapidly identified revenue and cost synergy opportunities that contributed to results in and that augur well for total schlumberger results reflect four months activity from the acquired smith businesses  which contributed revenue of billion 
in a related move  schlumberger signed a letter of intent with eurasia to swap certain assets in russia to build critical mass in drilling services 
under the terms of this agreement  eurasia will acquire a number of schlumberger owned drilling rigs  while schlumberger will acquire a range of eurasia service assets including directional drilling  measurement while drilling  well cementing and drilling fluids 
further  both companies agreed to enter a strategic alliance upon completion of the transaction whereby schlumberger will become the preferred supplier of drilling services to eurasia drilling for up to rigs for a year period 
this agreement not only increases the market for our services across the rig fleet of the largest russian drilling company  it also encourages the development of fit for purpose bottom hole assembly technology development as drilling intensity increases in russia in order to sustain hydrocarbon production 
two years ago we began a program called excellence in execution 
this was designed to create a step change in our service quality and efficiency and  in deepwater  was aimed at enabling clients to reduce the risk and cost of their deepwater operations 
the program  in addition to equipment and procedural improvements  provides for competency certification of all personnel involved in deepwater operations 
we have been encouraged by the initial results of this multiyear initiative  as well as by our customers acceptance of it 
while additional control and oversight will undoubtedly add cost  this will be offset in the long run by improvements in operating procedures and technology 
we therefore welcome current efforts to better understand and control the risks associated with deepwater operations 
for  economic projections for world real gdp growth are converging towards a median estimate of  slightly lower than the level  and still with a significant level of uncertainty 
a large gap exists between gdp growth rates of organization for economic cooperation and development oecd and non oecd countries particularly in china and in other developing asian economies 
however there is remarkable agreement on various oil demand forecasts for  which all lie within million barrels per day of each other 
as we look forward to it is therefore important to remember that the primary driver of our business has always been  and will remain  the demand for oil and gas 
oil prices have moved into a range that will encourage increased investment  particularly in exploration  which remains the swing factor in operators budgets 
while we do not anticipate any substantial recovery in deepwater us gulf of mexico  we do expect a marked increase in deepwater activity in the rest of the world 
these factors  coupled with increases in development activity and production enhancement in many other areas  promise stronger growth rates as the year unfolds 
for natural gas  activity in the united states is likely to remain strong at least through the first half of the year due to the commitments necessary to retain leases  the backlog of wells to be completed  and the contribution of natural gas liquids to overall project economics 
increased service capacity  however  will negatively affect pricing at some stage during the year 
overseas  the governing factor on gas activity  particularly in the middle east  will be the ability of many nations to use gas as a substitute for oil to meet increased local energy demand  thus freeing up more liquids for export 
elsewhere the long lead time necessary to execute large gas projects for lng exports will ensure that a certain level of activity is maintained 
unconventional gas resources will continue to attract considerable interest outside north america 
the leading activity will continue to be in conventional gas in tight  or low permeability  reservoirs  and in coal bed methane 
table of contents part ii  item developments 
there will be exploration activity around the potential that shale gas offers in many other parts of the world 
increased activity coupled with the greater technology needs of higher exploration  deepwater  and tight gas activity particularly outside north america will make a stronger year for schlumberger 
the importance of risk reduction and the minimization of drilling cost make the acquisitions of geoservices and smith major contributors to our future growth in this scenario

pretax operating margin increased bps sequentially to primarily driven by the robust performance in north america and strong contributions from the year end equipment and software sales 
north america fourth quarter revenue of billion increased sequentially and pretax operating income of million was higher 
sequentially  revenue in us land grew versus a increase in rig count due to a combination of additional service capacity  improved utilization  and high service intensity that mostly benefited well services technologies 
canada revenue grew from higher land activity for well services  although this was partially offset by a slowdown in offshore activity that impacted drilling measurements services 
the us gulf of mexico revenue increased through a modest improvement in shelf activity and from completion systems equipment sales 
an million early payout relating to services on an ipm gain share project triggered by the customer s sale of the field also contributed to area growth 
pretax operating margin for the area increased bps sequentially to 
this increase was largely driven by us land through stronger activity and increased efficiency for well services operations 
the ipm gain share payout contributed approximately million to area pretax operating income 
latin america fourth quarter revenue of billion decreased versus the prior quarter 
pretax operating income of million increased compared to the third quarter of sequentially  the brazil geomarket achieved record high revenue on strong deepwater activity  while revenue in the peru colombia ecuador geomarket grew from higher gain share on ipm activity in colombia and from testing services equipment sales in peru 
these increases  however  were insufficient to offset a significant revenue drop in the mexico central america geomarket where continuing security issues and client budgetary constraints further reduced ipm activity levels 
pretax operating margin improved bps sequentially to primarily due to a more favorable revenue mix in the peru colombia ecuador and venezuela trinidad tobago geomarkets 
europe cis africa fourth quarter revenue of billion increased compared to the third quarter of pretax operating income of million increased sequentially 
sequentially  revenue in the north sea geomarket increased primarily from higher activity in norway and from year end sis software sales 
in the west south africa geomarket  revenue grew on stronger activity that benefited wireline and drilling measurements services and on higher completion systems equipment sales 
caspian geomarket revenue increased from the startup of several projects that resulted in higher demand for drilling measurements  testing services and wireline technologies as well as from a well services equipment sale 
continental europe revenue grew on higher activity for well services and testing services technologies and on year end sis software sales 
these increases  however  were partially offset by a decrease in nigeria gulf of guinea geomarket revenue from lower completion systems equipment sales and from delays that reduced demand for wireline services 
russia revenue was also lower with the onset of the winter slowdown 
pretax operating margin improved sequentially by bps to primarily from a stronger mix of high margin wireline and drilling measurements services in the north sea and west south africa geomarkets as well as from year end sis software sales across much of the area 
these increases were partially offset by the impact of the activity weakness in the nigeria gulf of guinea geomarket 
middle east asia fourth quarter revenue of billion increased sequentially 
pretax operating income of million increased sequentially 

table of contents part ii  item sequentially  revenue growth resulted from the continued ramp up of ipm activity in iraq and the start of new offshore projects in east asia 
year end sales of artificial lift and completion systems equipment  well services products  and sis software also contributed to area growth 
these increases were partially offset by lower revenue in the australia papua new guinea geomarket resulting from offshore project completions and delays in land activity due to severe flooding  and by lower activity in the qatar geomarket that reduced demand for wireline and drilling measurements services 
pretax operating margin decreased bps sequentially to as the positive contribution from the year end sales and a more favorable revenue mix in the arabian geomarket were insufficient to offset the impact of the lower activity in the australia papua new guinea geomarket and startup costs in iraq 
westerngeco fourth quarter revenue of million increased sequentially 
pretax operating income of million increased sequentially

latin america revenue increased on strong activity in the brazil and peru ecuador colombia geomarkets partially offset by reduced ipm activity in mexico central america due to client budgetary constraints 
middle east asia area revenue grew from higher drilling activity in the australia papua new guinea  china japan korea and east asia geomarkets as well as from increased ipm activity and strong demand for well services technologies in the middle eastern geomarkets 
the addition of geoservices also contributed to the increased revenue 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in europe cis africa revenue as reduced activity in the north africa  libya  caspian and continental geomarkets and generally lower pricing across the area offset higher activity in russia 
year on year  pretax operating margin declined bps to as a significant improvement in north america area performance was insufficient to offset the reduced activity and weaker pricing in the europe cis africa area and lower ipm activity in latin america 
north america revenue of billion was higher than last year primarily due to strong activity in unconventional oil and gas reservoirs  improved pricing in us land for well services technologies and improved activity levels in oil basins in canada 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the us gulf of mexico revenue as a six month moratorium on drilling and lingering uncertainty about rules for operating resulted in the stoppage of deepwater drilling activity 
year on year  pretax operating margin increased percentage points to mostly due to the stronger activity and improved pricing in the us land  partially offset by the impact of the activity slow down in the us gulf of mexico 
latin america revenue of billion was higher than the previous year 
growth was strongest in the brazil geomarket where higher offshore activity increased demand for wireline and drilling measurements services technologies

oilfield services full year revenue of billion declined versus lower natural gas prices and unfavorable market fundamentals resulted in a decline in north america revenue  primarily in the us land and canada geomarkets 
europe cis africa revenue decreased mainly due to the weakening of local currencies against the us dollar and reduced activity in the russia  north sea  west south africa and caspian geomarkets as well as in framo  which was partially offset by increased activity in the north africa geomarket 
middle east asia revenue also fell by primarily due to decreases in the east asia  east mediterranean  arabian and australia papua new guinea geomarkets 
latin america revenue was only marginally lower than last year as the impact of the weakening of local currencies against the us dollar and much lower activity in venezuela trinidad tobago and peru colombia ecuador were nearly offset by stronger activity in mexico central america and brazil 
weakening of local currencies against the us dollar reduced revenue by approximately 
across the areas  all of the technologies recorded revenue declines except testing services 
ipm recorded revenue growth compared to the same period last year 
full year pretax operating margin decreased percentage points to  on the significant drop in activity and pricing pressure experienced across all the areas  but most notably in north america 
north america revenue of billion was lower than last year with reductions across the entire area 
the decreases were highest in us land and canada  where lower natural gas prices resulted in a steep drop in activity and consequent pressure on pricing 
canada revenue was also lower as the result of the weakening of the canadian dollar against the us dollar 
revenue in the us gulf of mexico geomarket was severely impacted by weaker shelf drilling activity and strong pricing pressure

pretax operating margin decreased bps to primarily as the result of the sharp activity decline in venezuela trinidad tobago and the lower gain share in peru colombia ecuador 
europe cis africa revenue of billion was lower than last year largely due to the weakening of local currencies against the us dollar  which reduced revenue by approximately 
in addition  revenue was negatively impacted by reduced customer spending that resulted in significantly lower activity and pricing erosion in russia and the north sea 
revenue in the west south africa and caspian geomarkets and in framo was also negatively impacted by lower activity levels 
these decreases were partially offset by a revenue increase in the north africa geomarket due to strong testing services product sales 
pretax operating margins declined bps to on a combination of the overall lower activity and heavy pricing pressure across the area 
middle east asia revenue of billion was below revenue was down across much of the middle east  especially in the east mediterranean and arabian geomarkets  due to reduced demand for drilling measurements  wireline and testing services technologies 
revenue in asia also fell  primarily due to a decrease in offshore exploration activity  which was most significant in the east asia and australia papua new guinea geomarkets  resulting in lower demand for testing services and wireline technologies as well as completion systems products 
pretax operating margin decreased bps to primarily as a result of the lower overall activity and a less favorable revenue mix across the area 
westerngeco full year revenue of billion was lower than revenue decreased across all product lines  with the largest declines experienced in marine and multiclient 
marine revenue declined due to lower activity combined with reduced pricing as the result of weak market conditions 
multiclient revenue decreased primarily in north america  as customers continued to reduce discretionary spending 
land revenue fell on lower crew utilization  while data processing revenue was down reflecting lower activity primarily in europe africa and in north america

schlumberger has outstanding letters of credit guarantees which relate to business performance bonds  custom excise tax commitments  facility lease rental obligations  etc 
these were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where schlumberger operates 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain 
a summary of all of schlumberger s significant accounting policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
multiclient seismic data the westerngeco segment capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data 
the carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at december  and was million and million  respectively 
such costs are charged to cost of revenue based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data 
however  under no circumstances will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a year straight line amortized value 
the carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred 
adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues  which involve significant judgment on the part of schlumberger  would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys 
significant adverse changes in schlumberger s estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period 
for purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library  future cash flows are analyzed primarily based on two pools of surveys united states and non united states 
the united states and non united states pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors including i various macroeconomic factors that 
table of contents part ii  item influence the ability to successfully market surveys and ii the focus of the sales force and related costs 
certain larger surveys  which are typically prefunded by customers  are analyzed for impairment on a survey by survey basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value 
judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve 
allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible  including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices 
depending on how such potential issues are resolved  or if the financial condition of schlumberger customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  adjustments to the allowance may be required 
inventory reserves inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
schlumberger maintains a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
this requires management to make assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional provisions for excess or obsolete inventory may be required 
goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets schlumberger records the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired as goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred 
goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of schlumberger s individual reporting units to their carrying amount to determine if there is a potential goodwill impairment 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill  schlumberger s reporting units are primarily the geographic areas comprising the oilfield services segment in addition to the westerngeco  m i swaco  smith oilfield and distribution segments 
schlumberger estimates the fair value of these reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis and or applying various market multiples 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is a matter of judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
schlumberger s estimate of the fair value of each of its reporting units comprising oilfield services as well as its westerngeco reporting unit were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values at the time of their annual goodwill impairment tests for due to the fact that the m i swaco  smith oilfield and distribution reporting units were acquired on august   just prior to their annual goodwill impairment tests  the fair value of these reporting units approximated their carrying value 
long lived assets  including fixed assets and intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in reviewing for impairment  the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
if such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset s recorded value  an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to its estimated fair value 
the determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management 
if there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value  schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future 
schlumberger evaluates the remaining useful life of its intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated amortization period 
income taxes schlumberger s tax filings are subject to regular audit by the tax authorities in most of the over jurisdictions in which it conducts business 
these audits may result in assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or  potentially  through the courts 
tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits 
estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience 
table of contents part ii  item and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances 
however  due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations  it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates 
in such an event  schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs 
pension and postretirement benefits schlumberger s pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts  which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates 
these assumptions are important elements of expense and or liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis  or upon the occurrence of significant events 
the discount rate schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high quality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations 
the following summarizes the discount rates utilized by schlumberger for its various pension and postretirement benefit plans the discount rate utilized to determine the liability for schlumberger s united states pension plans and postretirement medical plans was at december  and at december  the weighted average discount rate utilized to determine the liability for schlumberger s international pension plans was at december  and at december  the weighted average discount rate utilized to determine expense for schlumberger s united states pension plans and postretirement medical plans decreased from in to in the weighted average discount rate utilized to determine expense for schlumberger s international pension plans was decreased from in to in a higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and decreases expense 
the expected rate of return for our retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation are expected to be paid 
the expected rate of return for schlumberger s united states pension plans has been determined based upon expectations regarding future rates of return for the investment portfolio  with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class 
the expected rate of return on plan assets for the united states pension plans was in both and the weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the international plans was in and in a lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense 
schlumberger s medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
the overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized to determine both the postretirement medical expense as well as the postretirement medical liability as of december  was graded to over the next six years 
the following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions  holding all other assumptions constant  for the united states and international pension plans stated in millions effect on effect on pretax pension dec

schlumberger s functional currency is primarily the us dollar  which is consistent with the oil and gas industry 
approximately of schlumberger s revenue in was denominated in us dollars 
however  outside the united states  a significant portion of schlumberger s expenses is incurred in foreign currencies 
therefore  when the us dollar weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which schlumberger conducts business  the us dollar reported expenses will increase 
a increase or decrease in the average exchange rates of all the foreign currencies in would have changed revenue by approximately 
if the average exchange rates of the us dollar against all foreign currencies had strengthened by  schlumberger s income from continuing operations would have increased by approximately 
conversely  a weakening of the us dollar average exchange rates would have decreased income from continuing operations by approximately although the functional currency of schlumberger s operations in venezuela is the us dollar  a portion of the transactions are denominated in local currency 
for financial reporting purposes  such transactions are remeasured into us dollars at the official exchange rate  which until january was fixed at venezuela bolivares fuertes per us dollar  despite significant inflation in recent periods 
in january  venezuela s currency was devalued and a new exchange rate system was announced 
during the first quarter of  schlumberger began to apply an exchange rate of venezuelan bolivares fuertes per us dollar to its local currency denominated transactions in venezuela 
the devaluation did not have an immediate significant impact to schlumberger 
further  although this devaluation does result in a reduction in the us dollar reported amount of local currency denominated revenues and expenses  the impact is not material to schlumberger s consolidated financial statements 
schlumberger maintains a foreign currency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to protect its interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange rates 
foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options provide a hedge against currency fluctuations either on monetary assets liabilities denominated in other than a functional currency or on expenses 
at december   contracts were outstanding for the us dollar equivalent of billion in various foreign currencies 
schlumberger is subject to the risk of market price fluctuations of certain commodities  such as metals and fuel 
schlumberger utilizes forward contracts to manage a small percentage of the price risk associated with forecasted metal purchases 
as of december   million of commodity forward contracts were outstanding 
schlumberger is subject to interest rate risk on its debt and its investment portfolio 
schlumberger maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that uses a mix of variable and fixed rate debt combined with its investment portfolio and interest rate swaps to mitigate the exposure to changes in interest rates 
at december   schlumberger had fixed rate debt aggregating approximately billion and variable rate debt aggregating approximately billion 
schlumberger has entered into interest rate swaps relating to billion of its fixed rate debt as of december  whereby schlumberger will receive interest at a fixed rate and pay interest at a variable rate 
schlumberger s exposure to interest rate risk associated with its debt is also partially mitigated by its investment portfolio 
both short term investments and fixed income investments  held to maturity  which totaled approximately billion at december   are comprised primarily of money market funds  eurodollar time deposits  certificates of deposit  commercial paper  euro notes and eurobonds and are substantially all denominated in us dollars 
the average return on investment was in
