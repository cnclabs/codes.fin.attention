item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview cohu operates in three business segments 
our primary business is the development  manufacture  sale and servicing of test handling and burn in related equipment  and thermal sub systems for the global semiconductor industry through our wholly owned subsidiaries  delta design  inc and rasco gmbh 
this business is significantly dependent on capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers and test subcontractors  which in turn is dependent on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors that is subject to cyclical trends 
we expect that the semiconductor equipment industry will continue to be cyclical and volatile in part because consumer electronics  the principal end market for integrated circuits  is a highly dynamic industry and demand is difficult to accurately predict 
our other businesses produce mobile microwave communications equipment broadcast microwave services  inc and video cameras and accessories cohu electronics division 
orders for semiconductor test and assembly equipment as reported by semiconductor equipment and materials international semi declined in august  following seventeen months of sequential increases and continued to decline through november until increasing again in december 
despite the industry wide slowdown in orders  industry analysts gartner and vlsi believe that was the strongest growth year ever for the semiconductor equipment industry  following the biggest decline ever in strong demand for our products driven by high rates of equipment utilization in customers test facilities resulted in record orders and sales levels in our orders increased sequentially since the first quarter of fiscal and were at their highest level ever in the second quarter of fiscal after this period of rapid growth  we began to see indications of reduced near term demand from some customers and  as a result  orders for our semiconductor equipment decreased during the second half of fiscal 
table of contents inventory exposure is common in the semiconductor equipment industry due to the narrow customer base  the custom nature of the products we provide  and the shortened product life cycles that are caused by rapid changes in semiconductor manufacturing technology 
our operating results in the last three years have been impacted by charges to cost of sales related to excess  obsolete and lower of cost or market inventory issues 
these charges totaled approximately million during the three year period ended december  and were primarily the result of decreases or frequent changes in customer forecasts and  to a lesser extent  changes in our sales product mix 
our non semiconductor equipment businesses comprised approximately of our consolidated revenues during the last three years for the year ended december  
our microwave communications business develops  manufactures and sells mobile microwave communications equipment  antenna systems and associated equipment 
these products are used in the transmission of video  audio  and telemetry 
applications for these microwave data links include unmanned aerial vehicles uavs  public safety  security  surveillance  and electronic news gathering 
customers for these products are government agencies  public safety organizations  uav program contractors  television broadcasters  and other commercial entities 
operating results for our microwave communications segment were strong again in  and opportunities and prospects for this business continue to grow  especially in the law enforcement  government surveillance and combat tactical uav markets 
our video camera segment develops  manufactures and sells a wide selection of video cameras and related products  specializing in video solutions for security  surveillance and traffic monitoring 
customers for these products are distributed among security  surveillance  traffic control management  scientific imaging and machine vision 
this business was profitable again in and we expect the future operating results of this segment to improve as we introduce our new high definition  internet protocol ip cameras for the traffic and high end security and surveillance markets 
our management team uses several performance metrics to manage our businesses 
these metrics mainly focus on near term forecasts due to the short term nature of our backlog and include i orders and backlog for the most recently completed quarter and the forecast for the next quarter  ii inventory levels and related excess exposures typically based on the forecast for the next twelve months  iii gross margin and other operating expense trends  iv cash flow  v industry data and trends noted in various publicly available sources  and vi competitive factors and information 
due to the short term nature of our order backlog that historically has represented about three months of business and the inherent volatility of the semiconductor equipment business  our past performance is frequently not indicative of future near term operating results or cash flows 
application of critical accounting estimates and policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience  forecasts and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  however actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting estimates that we believe are the most important to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition and require complex management judgment include revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenue on sales to customers  which impacts our results of operations  estimation of valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically product warranty  inventory reserves and allowance for bad debts  which impact gross margin or operating expenses  
table of contents the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  unrecognized tax benefits and the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  which impact our tax provision  the assessment of recoverability of long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets  which primarily impacts gross margin or operating expenses if we are required to record impairments of assets or accelerate their depreciation  and the valuation and recognition of share based compensation  which impacts gross margin  research and development expense  and selling  general and administrative expense 
below  we discuss these policies further  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  however  these policies typically do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
revenue recognition we generally recognize revenue upon shipment and title passage for established products ie  those that have previously satisfied customer acceptance requirements that provide for full payment tied to shipment 
revenue for products that have not previously satisfied customer acceptance requirements or from sales where customer payment dates are not determinable is recognized upon customer acceptance 
for arrangements containing multiple elements  the revenue relating to the undelivered elements is deferred at estimated fair value until delivery of the deferred elements 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for bad debts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty we provide for the estimated costs of product warranties in the period sales are recognized 
our warranty obligation estimates are affected by historical product shipment levels  product performance and material and labor costs incurred in correcting product performance problems 
should product performance  material usage or labor repair costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
inventory the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality 
the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products 
the demand forecast is a direct input in the development of our short term manufacturing plans 
we record valuation reserves on our inventory for estimated excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market concerns equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future product demand  market conditions and product selling prices 
if future product demand  market conditions or product selling prices are less than those projected by management or if continued modifications to products are required to meet specifications or other customer requirements  increases to inventory reserves may be required which would have a negative impact on our gross margin 
income taxes we estimate our liability for income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
this requires us to estimate our i current taxes  ii temporary differences that result from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes and iii unrecognized tax benefits 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet 
the deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based upon all available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
establishing  reducing or increasing a valuation allowance in an accounting period generally results in an increase or decrease in tax expense in the statement of operations 
we must make significant judgments to determine the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  unrecognized tax benefits and any valuation allowance to be recorded against deferred tax assets 
our gross deferred tax asset balance as of december  was approximately million  with a valuation allowance of approximately million 
our deferred tax assets consist primarily of reserves and accruals that are not yet deductible for tax and tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards 
goodwill  purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units 
if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the 
table of contents carrying value 
we estimated the fair values of our reporting units primarily using the income approach valuation methodology that includes the discounted cash flow method  taking into consideration the market approach and certain market multiples as a validation of the values derived using the discounted cash flow methodology 
forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses  based primarily on customer forecasts  industry trade organization data and general economic conditions 
we conduct our annual impairment test as of october of each year  and have determined there to be no impairment 
there were no events or circumstances from the date of our assessment through december  that would impact this conclusion 
in a future period  should an event occur that leads us to determine that an interim goodwill impairment review is required  the facts and estimates utilized at that time may differ resulting in an impairment charge which could have a significant negative impact on our operating results 
long lived assets  other than goodwill  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable 
for long lived assets  impairment losses are only recorded if the asset s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted  probability weighted future cash flows 
we measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value 
contingencies we are subject to certain contingencies that arise in the ordinary course of our businesses which require us to assess the likelihood that future events will confirm the existence of a loss or an impairment of an asset 
if a loss or asset impairment is probable and the amount of the loss or impairment is reasonably estimable  we accrue a charge to operations in the period such conditions become known 
share based compensation share based compensation expense related to stock options is recorded based on the fair value of the award on its grant date which we estimate using the black scholes valuation model 
share based compensation expense related to restricted stock unit awards is calculated based on the market price of our common stock on the grant date  reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our common stock prior to vesting of the restricted stock unit

results of operations the following table summarizes certain operating data from continuing operations as a percentage of net sales in each of the last three years 
net sales cost of sales gross margin research and development selling  general and administrative acquired in process research and development income loss from operations in december  we purchased rasco 
the results of rasco s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date 
the portion of the purchase price allocated to in process research and development ipr d was expensed immediately upon the closing of the acquisition and therefore  million related to ipr d was included as an operating expense in our results of operations for the year ended december  
table of contents compared to net sales during  our consolidated net sales were approximately million  an increase of from the prior year 
sales of semiconductor equipment increased to million and accounted for of consolidated net sales in versus in during fiscal the sales of our semiconductor equipment business improved significantly as a result of high rates of equipment utilization on customer test floors that required investment in additional capacity  market share gains  capacity additions on new test floors and the sales synergies of our broad product line 
sales of microwave communications equipment accounted for approximately million or of consolidated net sales in  a decrease of when compared to the decrease during was primarily a result of lower sales to customers in the government surveillance market 
additionally  sales included approximately million of revenue previously deferred compared to approximately million of revenue deferred from to a future year  in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
sales of video cameras accounted for of consolidated net sales in and increased million or when compared gross margin gross margin consists of net sales less cost of sales 
cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of materials  assembly and test labor  and overhead from operations 
our gross margin can fluctuate due to a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the mix of products sold  product support costs  inventory reserve adjustments  and utilization of manufacturing capacity 
our gross margin  as a percentage of net sales  increased to in from in while higher than  due to the leverage generated by increased business volume and lower charges for excess and obsolete inventory  our gross margin in was impacted by higher costs due to the unforecasted production of our new test handlers in our poway plant  rather than at lower cost subcontractors  to meet customer delivery requirements and other new product start up costs 
our gross margin has been impacted by charges to cost of sales related to excess  obsolete and lower of cost or market inventory issues 
we compute the majority of our excess and obsolete inventory reserve requirements using a one year inventory usage forecast 
during and  we recorded net charges to cost of sales of approximately million and million  respectively  for excess and obsolete inventory 
while we believe our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory and lower of cost or market concerns are adequate to cover known exposures at december   reductions in customer forecasts or continued modifications to products  as a result of our failure to meet specifications or other customer requirements  may result in additional charges to operations that could negatively impact our gross margin in future periods 
conversely  if our actual inventory usage is greater than our forecasted usage  our gross margin in future periods may be favorably impacted 
research and development expense r d expense r d expense consists primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in ongoing research  product design and development activities  costs of engineering materials and supplies  and professional consulting expenses 
during r d expense as a percentage of net sales was compared to in  increasing in absolute dollars from million in to million in during  r d spending increased  primarily within our semiconductor equipment business  as a result of reinstating employee pay cuts that were in effect during and increased material costs related to product development 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a expense sg a expense consists primarily of salaries and benefit costs of employees  commission expense for independent sales representatives  product promotion and costs of professional services 
sg a expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to in  from in  increasing in absolute dollars to million in from million in due primarily to higher variable selling expenses as a result of increased sales within our semiconductor equipment segment and reinstating employee pay cuts that were in effect through during sg a spending across all our segments was reduced as a result of lower business volume and through cost control measures implemented in response to the global economic crisis which included head count and pay reductions 

table of contents interest and other  net interest and other  net was approximately million and million in and  respectively 
our interest income was lower in due to lower short term interest rates 
income taxes the provision for income taxes expressed as a percentage of pre tax income or loss was in and in the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  differs from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to a decrease in the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  foreign income taxed at different rates and other factors 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  differs from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
companies are required to assess whether a valuation allowance should be recorded against their deferred tax assets dtas based on the consideration of all available evidence  using a more likely than not realization standard 
the four sources of taxable income that must be considered in determining whether dtas will be realized are  future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences ie offset of gross deferred tax assets against gross deferred tax liabilities  taxable income in prior carryback years  if carryback is permitted under the tax law  tax planning strategies and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
in assessing whether a valuation allowance is required  significant weight is to be given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
we have evaluated our dtas each reporting period  including an assessment of our cumulative income or loss over the prior three year period and future periods  to determine if a valuation allowance was required 
a significant negative factor in our assessment was cohu s three year cumulative us loss history at the end of the and fiscal year periods 
after a review of the four sources of taxable income described above and in view of our three year cumulative us loss  we recorded an increase in our valuation allowance on us dtas  with a corresponding charge to our income tax provision  of approximately million in the second quarter of fiscal our valuation allowance on dtas at december  and december  was approximately million and million  respectively 
the remaining gross dtas for which a valuation allowance was not recorded are realizable through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences or loss carryback 
as the realization of dtas is determined by tax jurisdiction  the significant deferred tax liability recorded as part of the acquisition of rasco  a german corporation  was not a source of taxable income in assessing the realization of our dtas in the us for a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate and further explanation of our provision for income taxes  see note  income taxes  included in part iv  item a of this form k  which is incorporated herein by reference 
as a result of the factors set forth above  our net income was million in  compared to a net loss of million in compared to net sales during  our consolidated net sales were approximately million  a decrease of from the prior year 
sales of semiconductor equipment decreased to million and accounted for of consolidated net sales in versus in sales recorded by our semiconductor equipment segment during include twelve months of sales activity for rasco 
total semiconductor equipment sales generated by rasco  during  were approximately million 
the worldwide demand for semiconductors was dramatically reduced due to the global recession resulting in significant idle capacity for semiconductor manufacturers and lower demand for semiconductor equipment which impacted our sales 
during the second half of demand increased for semiconductor test handlers  device kits  spares  equipment upgrades and repairs  as our customers adjusted their production to respond to increased demand from their customers 
sales of microwave communications equipment accounted for approximately million or of consolidated net sales in  an increase of when compared to the increase during was primarily a result of increased sales to unmanned air vehicle program contractors 
additionally  sales included the recognition of approximately million of revenue previously deferred in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 

table of contents sales of video cameras accounted for of consolidated net sales in and decreased million or when compared the decreased sales in were a result of delayed funding for certain state and local government projects as a result of the economic recession 
additionally  video camera sales in benefitted from the recognition of million in deferred revenue upon the receipt of customer acceptance on a contract with a government subcontractor 
gross margin our gross margin  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to in from in as a result of lower sales volume in our semiconductor equipment segment and increased costs from the initial production of next generation handler products in our california plant 
during our gross margin was favorably impacted by approximately million when we sold certain inventory for a semiconductor burn in system that had been previously reserved due to a decline in customer forecasts 
during and  we recorded net charges to cost of sales of approximately million and million  respectively  for excess and obsolete inventory 
research and development expense r d expense in includes twelve months of costs for rasco 
during r d expense as a percentage of net sales was compared to in  decreasing from million in to million in during  r d spending was reduced by approximately million primarily within our semiconductor equipment business through cost control measures 
additionally  as our new pick in place test handler systems began to make the transition into production we incurred lower labor and material costs associated with product development 
these reductions were partially offset by million in incremental r d expense that resulted from the acquisition of rasco 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a expense in includes twelve months of costs for rasco 
sg a expense as a percentage of net sales increased to in  from in yet decreased  in absolute dollars  to million in from million in during sg a spending  across all our segments was reduced by approximately million primarily as a result of lower business volume and through cost control measures implemented in response to the global economic crisis which included head count and pay reductions and suspension of the matching contribution to our k plan 
these reductions were partially offset by million in incremental sg a expense resulting from the acquisition of rasco 
interest and other  net interest and other  net was approximately million and million in and  respectively 
our interest income was lower in due to a decrease in our cash and investment balances as a result of the rasco acquisition which occurred in december  and lower short term interest rates 
income taxes the provision benefit for income taxes expressed as a percentage of pre tax income was in and in the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  differs from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance on our dtas of approximately million recorded in the second fiscal quarter 
the benefit for income taxes for the year ended december  differs from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to state taxes  research and development tax credits  settlement of prior year tax returns  ipr d with no tax benefit and changes in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  by the effects of accounting guidance that does not allow deferred tax benefits to be initially recognized on compensation expense related to incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plans and interest expense recorded on unrecognized tax benefits 
as a result of the factors set forth above  our net loss was million in  compared to a net loss of million in 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources our business is dependent on capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers and test subcontractors that are  in turn  dependent on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors 
the cyclical and volatile nature of demand for semiconductor equipment  our primary industry  makes estimates of future revenues  results of operations and net cash flows difficult 
our primary historical source of liquidity and capital resources has been cash flow generated by our operations and we manage our businesses to maximize operating cash flows as our primary source of liquidity 
we use cash to fund growth in our operating assets and to fund new products and product enhancements primarily through research and development 
liquidity working capital the following summarizes our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and working capital at december  and december  percentage in thousands increase change cash  cash equivalents and short term investments working capital cash flows operating activities cash generated from operating activities consists of net income or loss  adjusted for non cash expenses and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
non cash items include depreciation and amortization  share based compensation expense  and deferred income taxes 
our net cash flows provided from operating activities in totaled million compared to million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a significant increase in business volume and profitability  primarily within our semiconductor equipment segment  in cash provided by operating activities was impacted by changes in current assets and liabilities and included increases in accounts receivable of million  inventories of million  deferred profit of million and income tax payable of million 
the increases in accounts receivable and inventories were driven primarily by our semiconductor equipment operations and resulted from increased business volume and inventory purchases made to support production requirements 
the increase in deferred profit was primarily due to the deferral of revenue related to certain semiconductor test handlers and microwave communication equipment in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
the increase in income taxes payable is a result of increased profitability and the timing of tax payments 
investing activities investing cash flows consist primarily of cash used for capital expenditures in support of our businesses  proceeds from investment maturities  and cash used for purchases of investments and business acquisitions 
our net cash used for investing activities in totaled million and was primarily the result of million in cash used for purchases of short term investments  offset by million in net proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments 
we invest our excess cash  in an attempt to seek the highest available return while preserving capital  in short term investments since excess cash is only temporarily available and may be required for a business related purpose 
other expenditures in included purchases of property  plant and equipment of million 
the purchases of property  plant and equipment were primarily made to support activities in our semiconductor equipment and microwave communications equipment businesses and consisted primarily of equipment used in engineering  manufacturing and related functions 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities consisted of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our equity incentive and employee stock purchase plans  which totaled million during we issue stock options and maintain an employee stock purchase plan as components of our overall employee compensation 
cash used in financing activities consisted of amounts distributed to our stockholders in the form of cash dividends 
we declared and paid dividends totaling million  or per common share  during on january   we announced a cash dividend of per share on our common stock  payable on  april  to stockholders of record as of march  we intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders 

table of contents capital resources we have a secured letter of credit facility the secured facility under which bank of america  na  has agreed to administer the issuance of letters of credit on behalf of cohu and our subsidiaries 
the secured facility requires us to maintain deposits of cash or other approved investments  which serve as collateral  in amounts that approximate our outstanding standby letters of credit 
as of december   we had approximately million of standby letters of credit outstanding 
we expect that we will continue to make capital expenditures to support our business and we anticipate that present working capital will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at december  amounts excluded include our liability for unrecognized tax benefits that totaled approximately million at december  we are currently unable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount or periods cash settlement of this liability may occur 
in thousands thereafter total non cancelable operating leases commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers 
from time to time  we enter into commitments with our suppliers to purchase inventory and contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products at fixed prices or in guaranteed quantities 
during the normal course of business  we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates 
however  our agreements with these suppliers usually allow us the option to reschedule or adjust our requirements based on our business needs 
typically purchase orders outstanding with delivery dates within days are non cancelable 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
we typically do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for the next six to twelve months 
off balance sheet arrangements 
during the ordinary course of business  we provide standby letters of credit instruments to certain parties as required 
as of december   the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these standby letters of credit was approximately million 
no liability has been recorded in connection with these arrangements beyond those required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed 
based on historical experience and information currently available  we do not believe it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk investment and interest rate risk 
at december   our investment portfolio included short term  fixed income investment securities with a fair value of approximately million 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will likely decline in value if interest rates increase 
our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
as we classify our short term securities as available for sale  no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other than temporary 
due to the relatively short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate ten percent change in interest rates would have no material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents we evaluate our investments periodically for possible other than temporary impairment by reviewing factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis  the financial condition of the issuer and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient for anticipated recovery of market value 
as of december  we evaluated our investments with loss positions and determined that these losses were temporary 
foreign currency exchange risk 
we conduct business on a global basis in a number of major international currencies 
as such  we are exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the majority of our sales are denominated in us dollars except for certain of our revenues that are denominated in euros 
certain expenses incurred by our non us operations  such as employee payroll and benefits as well as some raw materials purchases and other expenses are denominated and paid in local currency 
we considered a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the underlying exposures described above and believe that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
