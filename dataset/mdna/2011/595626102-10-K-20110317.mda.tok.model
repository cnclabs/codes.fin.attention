table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following table presents  for the fiscal periods indicated  selected financial information as a percentage of total sales and revenues 
percentage of sales and revenues fiscal year franchise royalties and license fees real estate revenues from franchised shops company operated shop retail sales replacement part sales and product royalties warranty fee revenue software sales and maintenance revenue sales and revenues franchised shops occupancy expenses company operated shop parts cost of sales company operated shop payroll and employee benefits company operated shop occupancy and other operating expenses replacement part cost of sales warranty expense benefit selling  general  and administrative expenses european arbitration award loss on sale of assets  net business transformation charges total operating costs and expenses operating income loss interest expense other income  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss company overview mds management is focused on building shareholder value through the profitable growth of the company 
the three main drivers of profit growth for mds are the refranchising of company operated shops  increasing the shop count through the opening of additional franchised units and increasing comparable shop sales 
these drivers are closely integrated  as the opening of franchises is much easier in an environment where franchised shop sales and profits are growing 
refranchising company operated shops while many of the company operated shops are profitable  the company operated shop business is unprofitable as a whole 
this is because the company has acquired unprofitable shops from certain multi shop franchisees in order to protect its markets 
most recently  the company acquired shops in northern california from a financially and operationally troubled franchisee in january the company acquired the shops in conjunction with a settlement between the franchisee and the california attorney general and the california bureau of automotive repair 
these shops generated an operating loss of million in the refranchising of company operated shops  particularly those that are unprofitable  benefits the company in a number of ways 
first  the operating losses and capital investment requirements of the shops are replaced by 
table of contents royalty revenue that has minimal associated costs and capital investment 
second  the operational risks associated with running a shop on a day to day business are no longer borne by the company 
third  the company is able to reduce corporate overhead in its company operated shop business and in back office support functions 
as of january   mds operated company operated midas  speedee and midas speedee co branded shops 
most of these shops are currently targeted for re franchising 
the company refranchised company operated shops in fiscal and expects to refranchise additional shops during the company would like to reduce to size of the company operated shop portfolio to fewer than shops 
achieving this goal will be a multi year process for the company 
growing shop count sales performance among us midas shops varies dramatically between the top third performing shops and the bottom third performing shops 
in fiscal  the top third performing shops reported comparable shop sales increases of over  including a increase in brake sales  while the bottom third performing shops experienced a decline in sales  including a decline in brake sales 
the company believes that the disparity in performance is substantially due to the fact that midas is an older franchise system and that certain long term franchisees are struggling with the ongoing changes required to adapt to the current automotive aftermarket 
as a result  the company has been working diligently to identify those franchisees that cannot or will not adapt to the new environment and has been assisting them in transitioning out of the midas system in favor of new franchise ownership 
the benefits of transitioning midas shops to new franchisees can be seen in the performance of these shops 
sales at shops within the first year after transition have historically far outperformed the sales performance of the broader midas system 
in some cases  the improvement is dramatic with sales rising by more than 
in the next several years the company hopes to accelerate the number of transitions each year and thereby increase the capacity of the midas system as a whole to adapt and succeed in this new business environment 
additionally  the company hopes to significantly increase the number of single shop  owner operator franchisees 
currently  about of shops in the midas system are owned by single shop franchisees compared to in mds management strongly believes the automotive service business is often best managed by single shop owners who work the business on a daily basis 
in addition to transitions  the company believes that the re opening of previously operated midas shops ie  available shop inventory and the acquisition conversion of competing automotive repair centers both provide a significant opportunity to grow the north american franchise system 
as of january   the company s available shop inventory consisted of shops  of which were owned by the company and of which were leased from third parties 
during  the company collected an average annual rent amount of approximately  from the locations it leased to franchisees and collected an average of  in royalties from each midas shop in north america 
therefore  the reopening of these previously operated shops has the potential of adding significant revenues and operating profits in the future 
the annual base rent obligation on the shops that are leased from third parties is approximately million 
the company also believes that the acquisition of existing automotive repair shops  as well as the conversion of independent repair facilities to the midas  speedee or co brand formats  is the most efficient way to grow the mds system 
furthermore  the company believes that the current economic environment will result in an increase in acquisition and conversion opportunities  as competitors struggle to remain viable 
growing comparable shop sales the company believes that the key to growing sales in the midas system in north america is to grow average daily car count by focusing on those services that are most critical to the regular maintenance of 
table of contents vehicles  namely  oil and other fluid exchanges  brake replacement and tire replacement 
these services are required of all vehicles at periodic intervals and management believes future success in automotive service requires that a service provider possess expertise  credibility and top of mind awareness in all three categories 
as a result  in  the company changed its promotional advertising strategy in the us from national television advertising to a more locally focused advertising approach featuring value priced oil changes 
this change has had a significant impact on average daily car count per shop  as car count grew by in fiscal and by an additional in fiscal the company believes that this value priced  locally focused oil change advertising strategy will provide an opportunity to form broader  longer term relationships with these new customers for brake repairs  factory scheduled maintenance and major repairs 
comparable shop sales of oil changes in north america have increased in each of the past three years and rose in fiscal however  revenues from this category still represent less than of us midas system sales  and the typical midas shop performs approximately eight oil changes per day 
while oil change revenue and car count have been growing over the past several years  management believes the midas system has the capacity to significantly increase that number 
with respect to growing brake sales  the company has been and continues to deliver training that is focused on establishing greater operating uniformity throughout the midas system  including phone handling  customer interaction  product stocking and the brake inspection process  as well as the customer follow up process 
the company also continues to believe that the sales of tires and related tire services represent a significant opportunity for sales growth at midas 
comparable shop sales of tires and related tire services in the us increased significantly in each of the prior four years and were up nearly in fiscal finally  the company believes that by co branding midas and speedee shops by combining into one location midas expertise in general repairs and strong brand awareness with speedee s strength in executing quick lube and fluid exchanges  that it has created a powerful new format focused on satisfying the needs of time pressed consumers seeking value  excellence in service and a long term auto service relationship 
the company began testing this concept by co branding franchised speedee shops in and midas company operated shops in early at the end of  there were co branded shops  including speedee shops that have added midas repairs and services and midas shops that have added speedee oil change services 
a brand new franchised midas speedee shop opened as a co brand in texas in late there are company operated midas shops in the chicago and san diego areas that added speedee services in these shops reported comparable shop sales increases of for the year 
an additional midas company shops added speedee in sales at these shops were up by during the portion of the year they were co branded 
two midas franchisees added speedee services to their midas shops in late and a third midas franchisee added speedee in the third quarter of comparable shop retail sales at these franchised locations increased by during the portion of the year they were co branded 
the comparable shop sales gains at these co branded shops were well above the us average for of approximately 
as a result  the company intends to make this program available to all qualifying midas and speedee franchisees and expects to co brand between and additional shops in mds management believes that while the current economic environment  and the need to develop stronger customer relationships and improve operations execution  pose significant challenges for automotive aftermarket service providers  the potential to succeed is significant for those automotive service providers that are willing and able to adapt

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management must make a variety of decisions which impact the reported amounts and related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied  the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates  and the consistent application of those accounting principles 
due to the type of industry in which the company operates and the nature of its business  the following accounting policies are those that management believes are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
valuation of warranty liabilities customers are provided a written warranty from mds on certain midas products purchased from midas shops in north america  namely brake friction  mufflers  shocks and struts 
the warranty will be honored at any midas shop in north america and is valid for the lifetime of the vehicle  but is voided if the vehicle is sold 
prior to july  in canada and january  in the us  product royalties received from the company s preferred supply chain vendors were recorded in revenue and substantially offset the cost of warranty claims 
beginning on january  in the us and july  in canada  the midas warranty program became funded directly by franchisees 
the company maintains a warranty accrual to cover the estimated future liability associated with outstanding warranties issued prior to july  in canada and january  in the us the company determines the estimated amount of outstanding warranty claims based on an estimate of the percentage of all warranted products sold and registered in prior periods at retail that are likely to be redeemed  and an estimate of the cost of redemption of each future warranty claim on a current cost basis 
these estimates are computed using actual historical registration and redemption data as well as actual cost information on current redemptions 
the determination of the number of products sold that are likely to be redeemed requires mds to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the relationship of historical warranty claim behavior  warranty claim behavior across product lines and geographical areas  and the impact of changes in consumer behavior on future warranty claims 
a decrease of one percentage point in the estimated percentage of warranted products likely to be redeemed in the us would have the effect of decreasing the company s january  outstanding us warranty liability by approximately million 
a change in the estimated current cost of warranty redemptions of one dollar would have the effect of changing the outstanding us warranty liability by approximately million 
as of january   the estimated aggregate deferred warranty obligations under the new us and canadian programs were million and the estimated aggregate warranty liability under the former program was million 
valuation of receivables the company records receivables due from its franchisees and other customers at the time the sale is recorded in accordance with its revenue recognition policies 
these receivables consist of amounts due from the sale of products  royalties due from franchisees and suppliers  rents and other amounts 
the future collectability of these amounts can be impacted by the company s collection efforts  the financial stability of its customers  and the general economic climate in which it operates 
recent market conditions have increased the uncertainty in making these estimates 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the collectability of these assets and could have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the company applies a consistent practice of establishing an allowance for accounts that it feels may become uncollectible through reviewing the historical aging of its receivables and by monitoring the financial strength of its franchisees and other customers 
where mds becomes aware of the inability of a customer or franchisee to meet its financial obligations eg  where it is in financial distress or has filed for bankruptcy  the company specifically reserves for the potential bad debt to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount it reasonably believes will be collected 
the valuation of receivables is performed on a quarterly basis 
in addition  the company records receivables from third parties at the time a transaction is completed 
these third party receivables are recorded at their estimated net realizable value 
on a quarterly basis  the company assesses the collectibility of these receivables 
pensions the company has non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain of its employees 
the company s funding policy for the us plan is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement of the employee retirement income act of  plus any additional amounts the company may deem to be appropriate 
the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with asc topic  compensation retirement benefits asc  which requires that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
the amount recorded as pension assets or liabilities is determined by comparing the projected benefit obligation pbo to the fair value of the plan assets 
amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income consist of unrecognized actuarial gains  losses  and prior service costs  net of tax 
as of january  and january   the company has recorded accrued pension costs as follows in millions fiscal year canadian prepaid pension asset canadian prepaid reserve accrued us pension liability pension liability to account for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with asc  the company must make three main determinations at the end of each fiscal year first  it must determine the actuarial assumption for the discount rate used to reflect the time value of money in the calculation of the projected benefit obligation for the end of the current fiscal year and to determine the net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
to determine this rate  the company s third party actuary prepares a detailed analysis of projected future cash flows using the mercer discount yield curve 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for a listing of the discount rates used by year 
second  the company must determine the actuarial assumption for rates of increase in compensation levels used in the calculation of the accumulated and projected benefit obligations for the end of the current fiscal year and to determine the net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
in determining these rates the company looks at its historical and expected rates of annual salary increases 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for a listing of the rates of increase in compensation levels used by year 
third  the company must determine the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption that is used to determine the expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return is deferred and is recognized in net periodic pension cost over a five year period 
see note of notes to consolidated financial 
table of contents statements included elsewhere in this annual report for a listing of the expected long term rates used by year 
the company assumed a long term rate of return on us pension assets of in fiscal and  and experienced gains on plan assets of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the company s pension plan investments are comprised primarily of bond and equity mutual funds and cash reserves 
the pension plans have no investments in alternative investment vehicles such as private equity funds or hedge funds  nor have the plans ever held such investments 
volatile market conditions over the past several years have increased the risks associated with certain investments held by mds pension plans which have negatively impacted the value of investments  net periodic pension costs and created funding requirements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for a further description of pension shortfalls we experienced in fiscal and related contributions we made in fiscal and we expect to have additional pension funding obligations in fiscal carrying values of goodwill and long lived assets goodwill the company tests the recorded amount of goodwill for recovery on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
goodwill is tested more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
the company continually assesses whether any indicators of impairment exist  which requires a significant amount of judgment 
such indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization  a decline in our expected future cash flows  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  or slower growth rates  among others 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step analysis 
in step one  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its book value 
management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these reporting units 
fair value is determined using a combination of present value techniques and quoted market prices of comparable businesses 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is not deemed to be impaired for that reporting unit  and no further testing would be necessary 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  the company performs step two 
step two uses the calculated fair value of the reporting unit to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
a charge is recorded in the financial statements if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than its implied fair value 
the determination of fair value of the reporting units and assets and liabilities within the reporting units requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to  the discount rate  terminal growth rates  earnings before depreciation and amortization  and capital expenditures forecasts 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates  actual results could differ from those estimates 
in both the us and canada  the reporting unit is defined as retail operations  which consists of both franchised and company operated locations 
both the us and canadian retail operations reporting units generate significant operating income and therefore the risk of goodwill impairment is remote 
long lived assets long lived assets include property and equipment  intangible assets  long term prepaid assets and other non current assets 
the company reviews long lived assets held for use for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
events that may indicate long lived assets may not be recoverable include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease 
table of contents in the market price of long lived assets  a significant adverse change in the manner in which the company utilizes a long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the business climate  a recent history of operating or cash flow losses  or a current expectation that it is more likely than not likely that a long lived asset will be sold or disposed of in the future 
for impairment testing purposes  the company groups its long lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities the asset group 
there were no events or changes in circumstances identified during the fiscal year that caused the company to test long lived assets for impairment 
if the company determines that a long lived asset or asset group may not be recoverable  it compares the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate to the asset or asset group s carrying value 
if the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows exceed the carrying amount of the asset or asset group  the asset or asset group is not considered impaired 
however  if the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets or asset group  a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value of the asset or asset group and the carrying value of the asset or asset group 
the fair value of the asset or asset group is generally determined by discounting the expected future cash flows using a discount rate that is commensurate with the risk associated with the amount and timing of the expected future cash flows 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates  actual results could differ from those estimates 
deferred income taxes in assessing the valuation of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the realizability of the company s deferred tax assets and could have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences at january  in the event that management determines the company would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
as of january   the company had recorded a valuation allowance of million against certain state income tax net operating loss carry forwards and foreign tax credit carry forwards because the company has determined that it is more likely than not that this portion of these deferred tax assets will not be realized 
however  due to the inherent uncertainty involved in determining the realizability of the company s deferred tax assets  the future realizability could differ from management estimates at january  impact of new accounting standards new accounting pronouncements adopted on january   mds adopted changes issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb to accounting for variable interest entities 
these changes require significant modifications to the analysis  evaluation and disclosure of variable interest entities 
the adoption of these changes had no material impact on the company s financial statements 
on january   mds adopted changes issued by the fasb to disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
specifically  the changes require a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the 
table of contents transfers 
the changes also clarify existing disclosure requirements related to how assets and liabilities should be grouped by class and valuation techniques used for recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
other than the required additional disclosures  the adoption of these changes had no impact on the company s financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements issued in october  the fasb issued new accounting guidance related to the recognition of revenue for multiple deliverable arrangements 
the company does not engage in the type of transactions covered by this guidance 
as a result  the company has determined that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on the on the company s financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued changes to disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
specifically  the changes require a reporting entity to disclose  in the reconciliation of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level  separate information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis rather than as one net number 
these changes become effective for mds beginning january  the company has determined that the adoption of this guidance will have no impact on the on the company s financial statements 
forward looking statements this report contains and oral communications made by mds may contain forward looking statements that may be identified by their use of words like plans  expects  anticipates  intends  estimates  forecasts  will  outlook should or other words of similar meaning 
all statements that address the company s expectations or projections about the future  including statements about mds s strategy for growth  cost reduction goals  expenditures and financial results  pending legal proceedings or the company s ability to recover any costs in such legal proceedings are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are based on the company s estimates  assumptions and expectations of future events and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
mds cannot guarantee that these estimates  assumptions and expectations are accurate or will be realized 
mds disclaims any intention or obligation other than as required by law to update or revise any forward looking statements 
the company s results of operations and the forward looking statements could be affected by  among others things general economic conditions in the markets in which the company operates  economic developments that have a particularly adverse effect on one or more of the markets served by the company  the ability to execute management s internal operating plans  the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures  the company s ability to access debt and equity markets  economic and market conditions in the us and worldwide  currency exchange rates  changes in consumer spending levels and demand for new products and services  and overall competitive activities 
certain of these risks are more fully described in item a of part i of the company s annual report on form k 
the company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to certain market risks  including foreign currency and interest rates 
mds uses a variety of practices to manage these market risks  including  when considered appropriate  derivative financial instruments 
the company uses derivative financial instruments only for risk management and does not use them for trading or speculative purposes 
mds is exposed to potential gains or losses from foreign currency fluctuations affecting net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies 
the company s primary exposure is to changes in exchange rates for the us dollar versus the canadian dollar and changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro for international license fees from europe 

table of contents interest rate risk is managed through variable rate borrowings in combination with swaps to fixed interest rates on a portion of those borrowings 
the company is exposed to credit risk on certain assets  primarily accounts receivable 
the company provides credit to customers and franchisees in the ordinary course of business and performs ongoing credit evaluations 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the large number of customers comprising the company s customer base 
the company believes its allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover customer credit risk 
the table below provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by the expected maturity dates 
the actual cash flows for each instrument are denominated and presented in us dollar equivalents in millions  which is the company s reporting currency 
expected maturity date there after total fair value long term debt revolving credit facility variable rate average interest rate the fair value of the company s revolving credit facility is determined as the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the current interest rate for loans of similar terms and comparable credit risk 
interest rate spreads have declined since the debt was refinanced on december  as a result  the fair value of the debt currently exceeds the book value 
in november  million in revolving bank debt was converted from floating rate to fixed rate by locking in libor at for a five year period 
in addition  in march  mds entered into an interest rate swap arrangement to convert an additional million in revolving bank debt from floating rate to a fixed rate by locking in libor at through october both of these swap arrangements expired prior to january  in january  the company entered into a million forward starting swap to coincide with the end dates of its existing swaps 
as a result of this forward swap transaction  in the period from november through october end of the recently extended bank agreement the company has locked in libor at for million of its million in revolving bank debt 
the company has no firmly committed sales transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
as discussed under item legal proceedings  an arbitral tribunal issued a ruling in march that requires the company to pay an award of million  plus interest through the date of payment  to its licensee in europe 
the company accrued this amount in its fiscal financial statements at the fiscal year end euro exchange rate of to the euro has strengthened versus the dollar since year end and the exchange rate is currently approximately to the award is to be paid as soon as possible 
unless the us dollars strengthens versus the euro and depending upon the exchange rate on the date of payment  the company may incur a substantial exchange loss on this payment 
a change in the exchange rate will result in a change of  in the award payment
