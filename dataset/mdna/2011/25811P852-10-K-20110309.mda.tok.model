construction lending due to market conditions in puerto rico  the company has ceased financing new construction of single family residential and commercial real estate projects  including land development  in puerto rico 
doral will continue to evaluate and appraise market conditions to determine if and when it will resume such financing 
doral bank had traditionally been a leading player in puerto rico in providing interim construction loans to finance residential development projects  primarily in the affordable and mid range housing markets 
in  the company reassessed its risk exposure to the sector and made a strategic decision to restrict construction lending to established clients with proven track records

mortgage origination channels doral bank pr s strategy is to defend its mortgage servicing portfolio primarily by internal originations through its retail branch network 
doral mortgage units are co located in of the retail bank branches of doral bank pr 
doral bank pr supplements retail originations with wholesale purchases of loans from third parties 
the principal origination channels of doral financial s loan origination units are summarized below 
retail channel 
doral bank pr originates loans through its network of loan officers located in each of its retail branches throughout puerto rico 
customers are sought through advertising campaigns in local newspapers and television  as well as direct mail and telemarketing campaigns 
doral bank pr emphasizes quality customer service and offers extended operating hours to accommodate the needs of customers 
doral bank pr works closely with residential housing developers and specializes in originating mortgage loans to provide permanent financing for the purchase of homes in new housing projects 
wholesale correspondent channel 
doral bank pr maintains a centralized unit that purchases closed residential mortgage loans from other financial institutions consisting primarily of conventional mortgage loans 
doral bank pr underwrites each loan prior to purchase 
for the years ended december    and total loan purchases amounted to approximately million  million and million  respectively 
for more information on doral financial s loan origination channels  refer to table f loan origination sources in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in this report 
mortgage loan underwriting doral bank pr s underwriting standards are designed to comply with the relevant guidelines set forth by the department of housing and urban development hud  gnma  rhs  va  fnma  fhlmc  federal and puerto rico banking regulatory authorities  private mortgage investment conduits and private mortgage insurers  as applicable 
doral bank pr s underwriting policies focus primarily on the borrower s ability to pay and secondarily on collateral value 
the maximum loan to value ltv ratio on conventional first mortgages generally does not exceed 
doral bank pr also offers certain first mortgage products with higher ltv ratios  which may require private mortgage insurance 
in conjunction with a first mortgage  doral bank pr may also provide a borrower with additional financing through a closed end second mortgage loan  whose combined ltv ratio exceeds 
doral bank pr does not originate adjustable rate mortgages arm or negatively amortizing loans 
however  the company has entered into certain loss mitigation arrangements that provide for a temporary reduction in interest rates 
the company uses external credit scores as a useful measure for assessing the credit quality of a borrower 
these scores are supplied by credit information providers  based on statistical models that summarize an individual s credit record 
fico scores  developed by fair isaac corporation  are the most commonly used credit scores 
doral bank pr sells the majority of its conforming mortgage loan originations and retains the majority of its non conforming loan originations in portfolio 
the company s underwriting process is established to 
table of contents achieve a uniform rules based standard while targeting high quality non conforming loan originations which is consistent with the company s goal of retaining a greater portion of its mortgage loan production 
mortgage loan servicing when doral financial sells originated or purchased mortgage loans  it generally retains the right to service such loans and to receive the associated servicing fees 
doral financial s principal source of servicing rights has traditionally been its mortgage loan production 
doral financial also seeks to purchase servicing rights in bulk when it can identify attractive opportunities 
the company believes that loan servicing for third parties is important to its asset liability management tools because it provides an asset whose value in general tends to move in the opposite direction to the value of its loan and investment portfolio 
the asset also provides additional fee income to help offset the cost of its mortgage operations 
servicing rights represent a contractual right and not a beneficial ownership interest in the underlying mortgage loans 
failure to service the loans in accordance with contract requirements may lead to the termination of the servicing rights and the loss of future servicing fees 
in general  doral bank pr s servicing agreements are terminable by the investors for cause 
however  certain servicing arrangements  such as those with fnma and fhlmc  contain termination provisions that may be triggered by changes in the servicer s financial condition that materially and adversely affect its ability to provide satisfactory servicing of the loans 
as of december   approximately  and of doral financial s mortgage loans serviced for others related to mortgage servicing for fnma  fhlmc and gnma  respectively 
as of december   doral bank pr serviced approximately billion in mortgage loans on behalf of third parties 
termination of doral bank pr s servicing rights by any of these agencies could have a material adverse effect on doral financial s results of operations and financial condition 
in certain instances  the company also services loans with no contractual servicing fee 
the servicing asset or liability associated with this type of servicing arrangement is evaluated solely based on ancillary income  float  late fees  prepayment penalties and costs 
doral bank pr s mortgage loan servicing portfolio is subject to reduction by reason of normal amortization  prepayments and foreclosure of outstanding mortgage loans 
additionally  doral bank pr may sell mortgage loan servicing rights from time to time to other institutions if market conditions are favorable 
for additional information regarding the composition of doral financial s servicing portfolio as of each of the company s last three fiscal year ends  refer to table g loans serviced for third parties in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in this report 
the degree of credit risk associated with a mortgage loan servicing portfolio is largely dependent on the extent to which the servicing portfolio is non recourse or recourse 
in non recourse servicing  the principal credit risk to the servicer is the cost of temporary advances of funds 
in recourse servicing  the servicer agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the mortgage loans  such as fnma or fhlmc  or with a private investor  insurer or guarantor 
losses on recourse servicing occur primarily when foreclosure sale proceeds of the property underlying a defaulted mortgage loan are less than the outstanding principal balance and accrued interest of such mortgage loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property 
prior to  doral financial often sold non conforming loans on a partial recourse basis 
these recourse obligations were retained by doral financial when doral bank pr assumed the servicing rights from doral financial 
for additional information regarding recourse obligations  see part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  off balance sheet activities in this report 
sale of loans and securitization activities doral financial sells or securitizes a portion of the residential mortgage loans that it originates and purchases to generate income 
these loans are underwritten to investor standards  including the stardards of fnma  fhlmc  and gnma 
as described below  doral financial utilizes various channels to sell its mortgage products 
doral financial issues gnma guaranteed mortgage backed securities  which involve the packaging of fha  rhs or va loans into pools of million or more for sale primarily to broker dealers and other institutional investors 
during the years ended december   and  doral financial 
table of contents issued approximately million  million and million  respectively  in gnma guaranteed mortgage backed securities 
conforming conventional loans are generally either sold directly to fnma  fhlmc or private investors for cash  or are grouped into pools of million or more in aggregate principal balance and exchanged for fnma or fhlmc issued mortgage backed securities  which doral financial sells to broker dealers 
in connection with such exchanges  doral financial pays guarantee fees to fnma and fhlmc 
the issuance of mortgage backed securities provides doral financial with flexibility in selling the mortgage loans that it originates or purchases and also provides income by increasing the value and marketability of such loans 
for the years ended december   and  doral financial securitized approximately million  million and million  respectively  of loans into fnma and fhlmc mortgage backed securities 
in addition  for the years ended december   and  doral financial sold approximately million  million and million  respectively  of loans through the fnma and fhlmc cash window programs 
also  during the fourth quarter of  doral bank sold million of loans to a private investor 
when the loans backing a gnma security are initially securitized they are treated as sales and the company continues to service the underlying loans 
the company is required to bring individual delinquent gnma loans that it previously accounted for as sold back onto its books as loan assets when  under the gnma mortgage backed securities guide  the loan meets gnma s specified delinquency criteria and is eligible for repurchase 
the rebooking of gnma loans is required together with a liability for the same amount regardless of whether the bank  as seller servicer  intends to exercise the repurchase buy back option since the company is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans 
at december   and  the loans held for sale portfolio includes million  million and million  respectively  related to defaulted loans backing gnma securities for which the company has an unconditional option but not an obligation to repurchase the defaulted loans 
payment on these loans is guaranteed by fha 
prior to the fourth quarter of  doral financial s non conforming loan sales were generally made on a limited recourse basis 
as of december   and  doral financial s maximum contractual exposure relating to its portfolio of loans sold with recourse was approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively  which included recourse obligations to fnma and fhlmc as of such dates of approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively 
as of december   and  doral financial had a recourse liability of million  million and million  respectively  to reflect estimated losses from such recourse arrangements 
doral financial estimates its liability from its recourse obligations based on historical losses from foreclosure and disposition of mortgage loans adjusted for expectations of changes in portfolio behavior and market environment 
the company believes that it has an adequate valuation for its recourse obligation as of december  and  but actual future recourse obligations may differ from expected results 
in the past the company sold non conforming loans to financial institutions in the us mainland on a non recourse basis  except recourse for certain early defaults 
since the company is retaining all of its non conforming loan production in its loan receivable portfolio 
while the company currently anticipates that it will continue to retain its non conforming loan production in portfolio  in the future  the company may seek to continue to diversify secondary market outlets for its non conforming loan products both in the us mainland and puerto rico 
in the ordinary course of business  doral financial makes certain representations and warranties to purchasers and insurers of mortgage loans at the time of the loan sales to third parties regarding the characteristics of the loans sold  and in certain circumstances  such as in the event of early or first payment default 
to the extent the loans do not meet specified criteria  such as a breach of contract of a representation or warranty or an early payment default  doral financial may be required to repurchase the mortgage loan and bear any subsequent loss related to the loan 
doral financial works with purchasers to review the claims and correct alleged documentation deficiencies 
for the years ended december   and 
table of contents repurchases amounted to million  million and million  respectively

puerto rico secondary mortgage market and favorable tax treatment in general  the puerto rico market for mortgage backed securities is an extension of the us market with respect to pricing  rating of investment instruments  and other matters 
however  doral financial has benefited historically from certain tax incentives provided to puerto rico residents to invest in fha and va loans and gnma securities backed by such loans 
under the puerto rico internal revenue code the pr code  the interest received on fha and va loans used to finance the original purchase of newly constructed housing in puerto rico and mortgage backed securities backed by such loans is exempt from puerto rico income taxes 
this favorable tax treatment allows doral financial to sell tax exempt puerto rico gnma mortgage backed securities to local investors at higher prices than those at which comparable instruments trade in the us mainland  and reduces its effective tax rate through the receipt of tax exempt interest 
insurance agency activities in order to take advantage of the cross marketing opportunities provided by financial modernization legislation  enacted in  doral financial entered the insurance agency business in puerto rico 
doral insurance agency currently earns commissions by acting as agent in connection with the sale of insurance policies issued by unaffiliated insurance companies 
during  and  doral insurance agency produced insurance fees and commissions of million  million and million  respectively 
doral insurance agency s activities are closely integrated with the company s mortgage loan originations with most policies sold to mortgage customers 
future growth of doral insurance agency s revenues will be tied to the company s level of mortgage originations  its ability to expand the products and services it provides and its ability to cross market its services to doral financial s existing customer base

notwithstanding  a corporation may be subject to the provisions of the pr code if it so elects it by the time it files its income tax return for the first year commenced after december  and ending before january  once the election is made  it will be effective for such year and the next succeeding years 
in computing its interest expense deduction  doral financial s interest deduction is reduced in the same proportion that its average exempt obligations including fha and va loans and gnma securities bear to its average total assets

the governor is elected every four years 
the legislative assembly consists of a senate and a house of representatives  the members of which are elected 
table of contents for four year terms

governmental responsibilities assumed by the central government of puerto rico are similar in nature to those of the various state governments 
in addition  the central government of puerto rico assumes responsibility for local police and fire protection  education  public health and welfare programs  and economic development 
the economy 
the economy of puerto rico is closely linked to the united states economy  as most of the external factors that affect the puerto rico economy other than the price of oil are determined by the policies of  and economic conditions prevailing in  the united states 
these external factors include exports  direct investment  the amount of federal transfer payments  the level of interest rates  the rate of inflation  and tourist expenditures 
during the fiscal year ended june   approximately of puerto rico s exports went to the us mainland  which was also the source of approximately of puerto rico s imports 
in the past  the economy of puerto rico has generally followed economic trends in the overall united states economy 
however  in recent years  economic growth in puerto rico has lagged behind growth in the united states 
the dominant sectors of the puerto rico economy in terms of production and income are manufacturing and services 
the manufacturing sector has undergone fundamental changes over the years as a result of an increased emphasis on higher wage  high technology industries  such as pharmaceuticals  biotechnology  computers  microprocessors  professional and scientific instruments  and certain high technology machinery and equipment 
the services sector  including finance  insurance  real estate  wholesale and retail trade  and tourism  also plays a major role in the economy 
it ranks second to manufacturing in contribution to puerto rico s gross domestic product and leads all sectors in providing employment

the number of persons employed in puerto rico during fiscal year averaged  a decrease of compared to the previous fiscal year 
during the first six months of fiscal year  total employment averaged  a decline of compared with the same period of the previous fiscal year  and the unemployment rate averaged 
future growth of the puerto rico economy will depend on several factors including the condition of the united states economy  the relative stability of the price of oil imports  the exchange value of the united states dollar  the level of interest rates  the effectiveness of the recently approved changes to the puerto rico income tax code and other tax laws  and the continuing economic uncertainty generated by the puerto rico government s fiscal condition described below 
the economy of puerto rico is very sensitive to the price of oil in the global market 
puerto rico does not have significant mass transit available to the public and most of its electricity is currently powered by oil  making it highly sensitive to fluctuations in oil prices 
a substantial increase in the price of oil could impact adversely the economy by reducing disposable income and increasing the operating costs of most businesses and government 
consumer spending is particularly sensitive to wide fluctuations in oil prices 
fiscal condition 
since  puerto rico has experienced a structural imbalance between recurring government revenues and total expenditures 
prior to fiscal year  the puerto rico government bridged the 
table of contents deficit resulting from the structural imbalance through the use of non recurring measures  such as borrowing from the government development bank for puerto rico gdb or in the bond market  postponing the payment of various government expenses  such as payments to suppliers and utilities providers  and other one time measures such as the use of derivatives and borrowings collateralized with government assets such as real estate 
since march  the government has taken multiple steps to address and resolve the structural imbalance 
for fiscal year  the deficit was approximately billion  consisting of the difference between revenues and expenses for such fiscal year 
the estimated deficit is projected to be approximately billion for fiscal year and approximately billion for fiscal year fiscal stabilization plan 
in january  the new puerto rico government administration  which controls the executive and legislative branches of government  developed and commenced implementing a multi year fiscal stabilization and economic reconstruction plan designed to achieve fiscal balance  restore sustainable economic growth and safeguard the investment grade ratings of the commonwealth 
the fiscal stabilization plan seeks to achieve budgetary balance  while addressing expected fiscal deficits in the intervening years through the implementation of a number of initiatives  including the following i gradual operating expense reduction plan through reduction of operating expenses  including payroll  which is the main component of government expenditures  and the reorganization of the executive branch  ii a combination of temporary and permanent revenue raising measures  coupled with additional tax enforcement measures  and iii a bond issuance program through puerto rico sales tax financing corporation cofina by its spanish language acronym 
the proceeds obtained from cofina bond issuance program have been used and are being used to repay existing government debt including debt with gdb  finance operating expenses of the commonwealth for fiscal years through and for fiscal year  to the extent included in the government s annual budget for such fiscal year  including costs related to the implementation of a workforce reduction plan  the funding of an economic stimulus plan  as described below  and for other purposes to address the fiscal imbalance while the fiscal stabilization plan was being implemented 
legislation was enacted during authorizing the implementation of all the measures in the fiscal stabilization plan 
government reorganization plan 
the administration has also taken the first steps to reorganize and modernize the executive branch 
on december   the governor signed act no 
that seeks to reduce the number of government agencies and operational expenditures 
unfunded pension benefit obligations and funding shortfalls of the retirement systems 
one of the challenges every puerto rico administration has faced during the past twenty years is how to address the growing unfunded pension obligations and funding shortfalls of the three government retirements systems that are funded principally with government appropriations 
as of june   the date of the latest actuarial valuations of the three retirement systems  the total unfunded accrued actuarial liability for the three retirement systems was billion 
according to preliminary actuarial valuations as of june   the total unfunded accrued actuarial liability for the three retirement systems was billion 
based on current employer and employee contributions to the retirement systems  the unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities will continue to increase significantly  with a corresponding decrease in their funded ratios  since the annual contributions are not sufficient to fund pension benefits  and thus  are also insufficient to amortize the unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities 
because annual benefit payments and administrative expenses of the retirement systems have been significantly larger than annual employer and employee contributions  the retirement systems have been forced to use investment income  borrowings and sale of investment portfolio assets to cover funding shortfalls 
the total funding shortfall basic system benefits  administrative expenses and debt service in excess of contributions for fiscal year for the three systems is expected to be approximately billion 
as a result  the assets of the retirement systems are expected to continue to decline and eventually be depleted during the next ten years 
since the commonwealth and other participating employers are ultimately responsible for any funding deficiency in the three retirement systems  the depletion of the assets available to 
table of contents cover retirement benefits will require the commonwealth and other participating employers to cover such funding deficiency 
it is estimated that the commonwealth would be responsible for approximately of the combined funding deficiency of the three retirement systems  with the balance being the responsibility of the municipalities and public corporations 
in order to address the growing unfunded benefit obligations and funding shortfalls of the three retirement systems  the governor of puerto rico established in february a special commission to make recommendations for improving the fiscal solvency of the three retirement systems 
the special commission delivered its recommendations to the governor in october the individual recommendations made by the members of the special commission  which included increasing the amount of the employer and employee contributions and changing the benefits structure  are being analyzed with the intent of presenting a comprehensive  consensus legislation during calendar year to improve the fiscal solvency of the three retirement systems 
economic reconstruction plan 
the puerto rico government administration also developed and implemented a short term economic reconstruction plan 
the cornerstone of this plan was the implementation of us federal and local economic stimuli 
puerto rico has benefitted and will benefit from the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra enacted by the us government to provide a stimulus to the us economy in the wake of the global economic downturn 
puerto rico has been awarded approximately billion in stimulus funds from arra during fiscal years to  which includes tax relief  expansion of unemployment benefits and other social welfare provisions  and domestic spending in education  health care  and infrastructure  among other measures 
the administration complemented the us federal stimulus with additional short and medium term supplemental stimulus measures seeking to address specific local challenges and providing investment in strategic areas 
these measures included a local million economic stimulus plan to supplement the federal plan 
the local stimulus was composed of three main elements i capital improvements  ii stimulus for small and medium sized businesses  and iii consumer relief in the form of direct payments to retirees  mortgage debt restructuring for consumers that face risk of default  and consumer stimulus for the purchase of housing 
the economic reconstruction plan also included a supplemental stimulus plan  which was designed to provide investment in strategic areas with the objective of laying the foundations for long term growth in puerto rico 
the supplemental stimulus plan is being conducted through a combination of direct investments and guaranteed lending 
it targets critical areas such as key infrastructure projects  public capital improvement programs  private sector lending to specific industries  and the export and research and development knowledge industries 
one example was the adoption of the real estate market stimulus act of  which provides certain incentives to help reduce the existing unsold housing inventory 
the housing incentives will be effective from september  to june  economic development plan 
the administration also developed the strategic model for a new economy  which is a comprehensive long term economic development plan aimed at improving puerto rico s overall competitiveness and business environment and increasing private sector participation in the puerto rico economy 
as part of this plan  the administration is emphasizing i the simplification and shortening of the permitting and licensing process  ii promoting the development of various projects through public private partnerships  iii the adoption of a new energy policy that seeks to lower energy costs and reduce energy price volatility  iv the adoption of a comprehensive tax reform that takes into account the commonwealth s current financial situation  and v implementing strategic initiatives targeted at specific economic sectors and development of certain strategic regional projects 
one of these goals was accomplished on december   when the puerto rico governor signed act no 
 which overhauls the existing permitting and licensing process in puerto rico in order to provide for a leaner and more efficient process the fosters economic development 
the administration also enacted acts no 
and in july  which provide for a new energy policy that seeks to lower energy costs and reduce energy price volatility by reducing puerto rico s dependence on fuel oil and the promotion of diverse  renewable energy technologies 

table of contents to further stimulate economic development and cope with the fiscal crisis  the administration established a legal framework via legislation approved in june to authorize and promote the use of public private partnerships to finance and develop infrastructure projects and operate and manage certain public assets 
private public partnerships provide the opportunity for the government to lower project development costs  accelerate project development  reduce financial risk  create additional revenue sources  establish service quality metrics  and redirect government resources to focus on the implementation of public policy 
during fiscal year the administration has commenced and expects to commence procurement for several public private partnership priority projects involving  among other things  school modernization  toll roads concession  airport concession and improvements in the water authority s meter reading  billing systems and customer services 
in february  the governor named a committee to review the commonwealth s income tax system and propose a tax reform directed at reducing personal and corporate income tax rates 
the committee presented its findings to the governor and in october  the governor announced that he was submitting to the legislative assembly various bills in order to implement tax reform 
legislation to implement the first phase of tax reform was enacted as act no 
on november  legislation to implement the second phase of tax reform was enacted as act no 
on january  the tax reform is focused on providing tax relief to individuals and corporations  providing economic development and job creation  simplifying the tax system and reducing tax evasion through enhanced tax compliance measures 
in general terms  the tax reform is intended to be revenue positive for the commonwealth as it includes  among other things  a temporary excise tax on affiliates of multinational manufacturers operating in puerto rico  the elimination of certain incentives and tax credits  and enhanced tax compliance measures to finance the tax rate reductions for corporations and individuals 
the administration has also identified strategic initiatives to promote economic growth in various sectors of the economy where the commonwealth has competitive advantages and several strategic regional projects aimed as fostering balanced economic development throughout the island 
these projects  some of which are ongoing  include tourism and urban redevelopment projects

in general terms  many of these laws and regulations generally aim to protect our depositors and our customers  not necessarily our shareholders or our creditors 
any changes in applicable laws or regulations  and in their application by regulatory agencies  may materially affect our business and prospects 
proposed legislative or regulatory changes may also affect our operations 
the following description summarizes some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject 
references to applicable statutes and regulations are brief summaries  do not purport to be complete  and are qualified in their entirety by reference to such statutes and regulations 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of on july   president obama signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of the dodd frank act 
the dodd frank act will have a broad impact on the financial services industry  including significant regulatory and compliance changes including  among other things  i enhanced resolution authority of troubled and failing banks and their holding companies  ii increased capital and liquidity requirements  iii increased regulatory examination fees  iv changes to assessments to be paid to the fdic for federal deposit insurance  and v numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of  and strengthening safety and soundness for  the financial services sector 
additionally  the dodd frank act establishes a new framework for systemic risk oversight within the financial system to be distributed among new and existing federal regulatory agencies  including the financial stability oversight council  the federal reserve  the office of the comptroller of the currency  and the fdic 
a summary of certain provisions of the dodd frank act is set forth below  along with information set forth in other parts of this regulation and supervision section 

table of contents increased capital standards and enhanced supervision 
the federal banking agencies are required to establish minimum leverage and risk based capital requirements for banks and bank holding companies 
these new standards will be no lower than current regulatory capital and leverage standards applicable to insured depository institutions and may  in fact  be higher when established by the agencies 
the dodd frank act also increases regulatory oversight  supervision and examination of banks  bank holding companies and their respective subsidiaries by the appropriate regulatory agency 
the consumer financial protection bureau bureau 
the dodd frank act creates the bureau within the federal reserve 
the bureau is tasked with establishing and implementing rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with respect to the conduct of providers of certain consumer financial products and services 
the bureau has rulemaking authority over many of the statutes governing products and services offered to bank consumers 
in addition  the dodd frank act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are more stringent than those regulations promulgated by the bureau  and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce consumer protection rules adopted by the bureau against state chartered institutions 
deposit insurance 
the dodd frank act makes permanent the  deposit insurance limit for insured deposits 
amendments to the federal deposit insurance act also revise the assessment base against which an insured depository institution s deposit insurance premiums paid to the deposit insurance fund dif will be calculated 
under the amendments  the assessment base will no longer be the institution s deposit base  but rather its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity during the assessment period 
additionally  the dodd frank act makes changes to the minimum designated reserve ratio of the dif  increasing the minimum from percent to percent of the estimated amount of total insured deposits and eliminating the requirement that the fdic pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds 
in december  the fdic increased the reserve ratio to percent 
the dodd frank act also provides that  effective one year after the date of enactment  depository institutions may pay interest on demand deposits 
transactions with affiliates 
the dodd frank act enhances the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates under section a and b of the federal reserve act  including an expansion of the definition of covered transactions and increasing the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained 
transactions with insiders 
insider transaction limitations are expanded through the strengthening of loan restrictions to insiders and the expansion of the types of transactions subject to the various limits  including derivative transactions  repurchase agreements  reverse repurchase agreements and securities lending or borrowing transactions 
restrictions are also placed on certain asset sales to and from an insider to an institution  including requirements that such sales be on market terms and  in certain circumstances  approved by the institution s board of directors 
enhanced lending limits 
the dodd frank act strengthens the existing limits on a depository institution s credit exposure to one borrower 
current banking law limits a depository institution s ability to extend credit to one person or group of related persons in an amount exceeding certain thresholds 
the dodd frank act expands the scope of these restrictions to include credit exposure arising from derivative transactions  repurchase agreements  and securities lending and borrowing transactions 
compensation practices 
the dodd frank act provides that the appropriate federal regulators must establish standards prohibiting as an unsafe and unsound practice any compensation plan of a bank holding company or other covered financial institution that provides an insider or other employee with excessive compensation or could lead to a material financial loss to such firm 
in february  the fdic and other federal banking and securities agencies issued a notice or proposed rulemaking on incentive based compensation arrangements as required by the dodd frank act 
the proposed rule has five key components i requiring the deferral of at least of incentive compensation for a minimum of three years for executive officers of financial institutions with consolidated assets of billion or more  ii prohibiting incentive based compensation arrangements for executive officers  employees  directors and principal shareholders covered persons that would encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation  iii prohibiting 
table of contents incentive based compensation arrangements for covered persons that would expose the institution to inappropriate risks by providing compensation that could lead to material financial loss  iv requiring policies and procedures for incentive based compensation arrangements that are commensurate with the size and complexity of the institution  and v requiring annual reports on incentive compensation structures to the institution s appropriate federal regulator 
debit card interchange fees and routing 
the dodd frank act amends the electronic funds transfer act to  among other things  give the federal reserve the authority to establish rules regarding interchange fees charged for electronic debit transactions by payment card issuers having assets over billion and to enforce a new statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of the transaction to the issuer 
in december the federal reserve issued a proposed rule that would have the effect to limiting the amount of debit charge interchange fees charged by banks 
the proposal outlines two alternatives for computing a reasonable and proportional fee 
in the press release accompanying the proposed rule  the federal reserve noted that if it adopts either of the proposed standards  the maximum allowable debit card interchange fee received by covered issuers would be more than lower that the average 
the proposed rule also seeks to limit network exclusivity  requiring issuers to ensure that a debit card transaction can be carried on several unaffiliated networks 
the new rules would apply to bank issuers with more than billion in assets and would take effect in july we expect that many of the requirements called for in the dodd frank act will be implemented over time  and most will be subject to implementing regulations over the course of several years 
given the uncertainty associated with the manner in which the provisions of the dodd frank act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies and through regulations  the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on financial institutions operations is unclear 
the changes resulting from the dodd frank act may impact the profitability of our business activities  require changes to certain of our business practices  impose upon us more stringent capital  liquidity and leverage ratio requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business 
these changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes in order to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements

this support may be required at times when  absent such policy  the bank holding company might not otherwise provide such support 
in furtherance of this policy  the federal reserve may require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or relinquish control of a nonbank subsidiary other than a nonbank subsidiary of a bank upon the federal reserve s determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness or stability of any subsidiary depository institution of the bank holding company 
further  federal bank regulatory authorities have additional discretion to require a bank holding company to divest itself of any bank or nonbank subsidiary if the agency determines that divestiture may aid the depository institution s financial condition 
in addition  any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank 
in the event of a bank holding company s reorganization in a chapter bankruptcy proceeding  any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary depository institution will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment 
as a bank holding company  doral financial s right to participate in the assets of any subsidiary upon the latter s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors including depositors in the case of depository institution subsidiaries except to the extent that doral financial may itself be a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary 
under the federal deposit insurance act the fdia  a depository institution which term includes both commercial banks and savings banks  the deposits of which are insured by the fdic  can be held liable for any loss incurred by  or reasonably expected to be incurred by  the fdic in connection with i the default of a commonly controlled fdic insured depository institution  or ii any assistance provided by the fdic to any commonly controlled fdic insured depository institution in danger of default 
default is defined generally as the appointment of a conservator or a receiver and in danger of default is defined generally as the 
table of contents existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 
in some circumstances depending upon the amount of the loss or anticipated loss suffered by the fdic  cross guarantee liability may result in the ultimate failure or insolvency of one or more insured depository institutions in a holding company structure 
any obligation or liability owed by a subsidiary depository institution to its parent company is subordinated to the subsidiary bank s cross guarantee liability with respect to commonly controlled insured depository institutions 
financial modernization legislation as discussed above  on january   doral financial withdrew its election to be treated as a financial holding company 
under the gramm leach bliley act  bank holding companies  all of whose depository institutions are well capitalized and well managed  as defined in the bhc act  and which obtain satisfactory community reinvestment act ratings  may elect to be treated as financial holding companies fhcs 
fhcs are permitted to engage in a broader spectrum of activities than those permitted to other bank holding companies 
fhcs can engage in any activities that are financial in nature  including insurance underwriting and brokerage  and underwriting and dealing in securities without a revenue limit or other limits applicable to foreign securities affiliates which include puerto rico securities affiliates for these purposes 
as noted above  the withdrawal of financial holding company status did not adversely affect doral financial s current operations 
the gramm leach bliley act also modified other laws  including laws related to financial privacy and community reinvestment 
the new financial privacy provisions generally prohibit financial institutions  including doral financial s mortgage banking and banking subsidiaries  from disclosing non public personal financial information to third parties unless customers have the opportunity to opt out of the disclosure 
capital adequacy under the federal reserve s risk based capital guidelines for bank holding companies  the minimum guidelines for the ratio of qualifying total capital total capital to risk weighted assets including certain off balance sheet items  such as standby letters of credit is 
at least half of total capital is to be comprised of common equity  retained earnings  minority interests in unconsolidated subsidiaries  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of cumulative perpetual preferred stock  in the case of a bank holding company  less goodwill and certain other intangible assets discussed below tier capital 
the remainder may consist of a limited amount of subordinated debt  other preferred stock  certain other instruments and a limited amount of loan and lease loss reserves tier capital 
in computing total risk weighted assets  bank and bank holding company assets are given risk weights of   and 
in addition  certain off balance sheet items are given similar credit conversion factors to convert them to asset equivalent amounts to which an appropriate risk weight will apply 
most loans will be assigned to the risk category  except for performing first mortgage loans fully secured by to family and certain multi family residential property  which carry a risk rating 
most investment securities including  primarily  general obligation claims on states or other political subdivisions of the united states will be assigned to the category  except for municipal or state revenue bonds  which have a risk weight  and direct obligations of the us treasury or obligations backed by the full faith and credit of the us government  which have a risk weight 
in covering off balance sheet items  direct credit substitutes  including general guarantees and standby letters of credit backing financial obligations  are given a conversion factor 
transaction related contingencies such as bid bonds  standby letters of credit backing non financial obligations  and undrawn commitments including commercial credit lines with an initial maturity of more than one year have a conversion factor 
short term commercial letters of credit are converted at and certain short term unconditionally cancelable commitments have a factor 
in addition  the federal reserve has established minimum leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies 
these guidelines provide for a minimum ratio of tier capital to total assets  less goodwill and certain other intangible assets the leverage ratio of for bank holding companies that have the highest regulatory rating or have implemented the federal reserve s market risk capital measure 
all other bank 
table of contents holding companies are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 
the guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing significant internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels  without significant reliance on intangible assets 
furthermore  the guidelines indicate that the federal reserve will continue to consider a tangible tier leverage ratio and other indicators of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities 
the tangible tier leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organization s tier capital  less all intangibles  to average total assets  less all intangibles 
the fdic and the ots have established regulatory capital requirements for state non member insured banks and federal savings banks  such as doral bank pr and doral bank us  respectively  that are substantially similar to those adopted by the federal reserve for bank holding companies 
on march   doral financial entered into a consent order with the federal reserve  pursuant to which the company submitted a capital plan in which it established a target minimum leverage ratio of for doral financial and for doral bank pr 
please refer to part i  item legal proceedings for additional information regarding doral financial s regulatory matters 
set forth below are doral financial s  doral bank pr s and doral bank us s capital ratios at december   based on existing federal reserve  fdic and ots guidelines 
banking well doral doral doral capitalized financial bank pr bank us minimum total capital ratio total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital ratio tier capital to risk weighted assets leverage ratio tier capital to average assets in the case of doral financial and doral bank pr and tier capital to adjusted total assets in the case of doral bank us 
as of december   doral bank pr and doral bank us were in compliance with all the regulatory capital requirements that were applicable to them as a state non member bank and federal savings bank  respectively 
please refer to part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  regulatory capital ratios for additional information regarding doral financial s regulatory capital ratios 
as of december   both of the company s banking subsidiaries were considered well capitalized banks for purposes of prompt corrective action regulations adopted by the fdic pursuant to the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of on march   the board of directors of doral financial approved a capital infusion of up to million to doral bank pr  of which million was made during the first quarter of on november   the board of directors approved an additional capital contribution of up to million to doral bank pr  which was made during november and december during the second and third quarter of  the board of directors of doral financial approved capital contributions to doral bank pr totaling million 
failure to meet minimum regulatory capital requirements could result in the initiation of certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by banking regulators against doral financial and its banking subsidiaries that  if undertaken  could have a material adverse effect on doral financial  such as a variety of enforcement remedies  including  with respect to an insured bank or savings bank  the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic  and to certain restrictions on its business 
see prompt corrective action plan under fdicia below 
under the dodd frank act  federal banking agencies are required to establish minimum leverage and risk based capital requirements for banks and bank holding companies 
these new standards will be no lower 
table of contents than current regulatory capital and leverage standards applicable to insured depository institutions and may  in fact  be higher when established by the agencies 
basel capital standards the current risk based capital guidelines are based upon the capital accord of the international basel committee on banking supervision  a committee of central banks and bank supervisors and regulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines for use by each country s supervisors in determining the supervisory policies they apply 
a new international accord  referred to as basel ii  became mandatory for large or core international banks outside the us in total assets of billion or more or consolidated foreign exposures of billion or more and emphasizes internal assessment of credit  market and operational risk  as well as supervisory assessment and market discipline in determining minimum capital requirements 
it is optional for other banks 
in september  the group of governors and heads of supervisors of the basel committee on banking supervision  the oversight body of the basel committee  published its calibrated capital standards for major banking institutions  referred to as basel iii 
under these standards  when fully phased in on january   banking institutions will be required to maintain heightened tier common equity  tier capital  and total capital ratios  as well as maintaining a capital conservation buffer 
the tier common equity and tier capital ratio requirements will be phased in incrementally between january  and january   the deductions from common equity made in calculating tier common equity will be phased in incrementally over a four year period commencing on january   and the capital conservation buffer will be phased in incrementally between january  and january  the basel committee also announced that a countercyclical buffer of to of common equity or other fully loss absorbing capital will be implemented according to national circumstances as an extension of the conservation buffer 
the us banking agencies have indicated informally that they expect to propose regulations implementing basel iii in mid with final adoption of implementing regulations in mid notwithstanding the release of the basel iii framework as a final framework  the basel committee is considering further amendments to basel iii 
in addition to basel iii  dodd frank act requires or permits the federal banking agencies to adopt regulations affecting the capital requirements of financial institutions in a number of respects  including potentially more stringent capital requirements 
the ultimate impact on doral financial and its banking subsidiaries of the new capital and liquidity standards that may be adopted cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including the final regulatory actions taken by federal banking regulators 
however  any requirement that doral financial and its banking subsidiaries maintain more capital  with common equity as a more predominant component  or meet new liquidity requirements  could significantly affect our financial condition  operations  capital position and ability to pursue certain business opportunities 
prompt corrective action under fdicia under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of and the regulations promulgated thereunder fdicia  federal banking regulators must take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
fdicia and the regulations thereunder  establish five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
a depository institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it maintains a leverage ratio of at least  a risk based tier capital ratio of at least and a risk based total capital ratio of at least  and is not subject to any written agreement or regulatory directive to meet a specific capital level 
a depository institution is deemed to be adequately capitalized if it is not well capitalized but maintains a leverage ratio of at least or at least if given the highest regulatory rating and not experiencing or anticipating significant growth  a risk based tier l capital ratio of at least and a risk based total capital ratio of at least 
a depository institution is deemed to be undercapitalized if it fails to meet the standards for adequately capitalized institutions unless it is deemed to be significantly or critically undercapitalized 
an institution is deemed to be significantly undercapitalized if it has a leverage ratio of less than  a risk based tier capital ratio of less than or a risk based total 
table of contents capital ratio of less than 
an institution is deemed to be critically undercapitalized if it has tangible equity equal to or less of total assets 
a depository institution may be deemed to be in a capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its actual capital position if it receives a less than satisfactory examination rating in any one of four categories 
at december   doral financial s banking subsidiaries were well capitalized pursuant to the prompt corrective action standard as implemented by the primary regulators 
doral bank pr s and doral bank us s capital categories  as determined by applying the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia  may not constitute an accurate representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of doral bank pr or doral bank us  and should be considered in conjunction with other available information regarding the institutions financial condition and results of operations 
fdicia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized 
undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the federal reserve system 
in addition  undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit capital restoration plans 
a depository institution s holding company must guarantee the capital plan  up to an amount equal to the lesser of i of the depository institution s assets at the time it becomes undercapitalized or ii the amount of the capital deficiency when the institution fails to comply with the plan 
the federal banking agencies may not accept a capital plan without determining  among other things  that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution s capital 
if a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan  it is treated as if it were significantly undercapitalized 
significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions  including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized  requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks 
critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator 
the capital based prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia and their implementing regulations apply to fdic insured depository institutions such as doral bank pr and doral bank us  but they are not directly applicable to bank holding companies  such as doral financial  which control such institutions 
however  federal banking agencies have indicated that  in regulating bank holding companies  they may take appropriate action at the holding company level based on their assessment of the effectiveness of supervisory actions imposed upon subsidiary insured depository institutions pursuant to such provisions and regulations 
interstate banking legislation effective june   the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of the riegle neal act amended the fdia and certain other statutes to permit state and national banks with different home states to merge across state lines  with the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency  unless the home state of a participating bank had passed legislation prior to may   expressly prohibiting interstate mergers 
under the riegle neal act amendments  once a state or national bank has established branches in a state  that bank may establish and acquire additional branches at any location in the state at which any bank involved in the interstate merger transaction could have established or acquired branches under applicable federal or state law 
if a state opts out of interstate branching within the specified time period  no bank in any other state may establish a branch in the state which has opted out  whether through an acquisition or de novo 
for purposes of the riegle neal act amendments to the fdia  doral bank pr is treated as a state bank and is subject to the same restrictions on interstate branching as other state banks 
however  for purposes of the international banking act the iba  doral bank pr is considered to be a foreign bank and may branch interstate by merger or de novo to the same extent as a domestic bank in doral bank pr s home state 
because doral bank pr does not currently operate in the mainland united states  it has not designated a home state for purposes of the iba 
it is not yet possible to determine how these statutes will be 
table of contents harmonized  with respect either to which federal agency will approve interstate transactions or with respect to which home state determination rules will apply 
under the dodd frank act  national banks and state banks are now able to establish branches in any state if that state would permit the establishment of the branch by a state bank chartered in that state 
as a federal savings bank  doral bank us is subject to the branching regulations promulgated by the ots 
such regulations allow doral bank us to branch on an interstate basis without geographic limitations 
dividend restrictions the payment of dividends to doral financial by its banking subsidiaries may be affected by regulatory requirements and policies  such as the maintenance of adequate capital 
if  in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority  a depository institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in  or is about to engage in  an unsafe or unsound practice  depending on the financial condition of the depository institution  could include the payment of dividends  such authority may require  after notice and hearing  that such depository institution cease and desist from such practice 
the fdic has indicated that the payment of dividends would constitute unsafe and unsound practice if the payment would deplete a depository institution s capital base to an inadequate level 
moreover  the federal reserve and the fdic have issued policy statements that generally provide that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings 
in addition  all insured depository institutions are subject to the capital based limitations required by fdicia 
please refer to fdicia above for additional information 
on march   doral financial and its principal puerto rico banking subsidiary  doral bank pr  entered into consent orders with the federal reserve  the fdic and the office of the commissioner 
the mutually agreed upon orders prohibit doral bank pr from paying dividends to doral financial without obtaining prior written approval from the fdic and federal reserve  and the federal reserve order prohibits doral financial from paying dividends to its stockholders without the prior written approval of the federal reserve 
the fdic and the office of the commissioner lifted their consent order on january  the consent order with the federal reserve remains in effect 
please refer to regulation and supervision banking activities puerto rico regulation  below  for a description of certain restrictions on doral bank pr s ability to pay dividends under puerto rico law 
please refer to regulation and supervision banking activities savings bank regulation  below  for a description of certain restrictions on doral bank us s ability to pay dividends under ots regulations 
fdic insurance assessments the deposits of doral bank pr and doral bank us are insured by the deposit insurance fund dif of the fdic  and are therefore subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments 
as mentioned above  the dodd frank act permanently raised the basic limit on deposit insurance by the fdic from  to  the coverage limit is per depositor  per insured depository institution for each account ownership category 
the dodd frank act also set a new minimum dif reserve ratio at of estimated insured deposits 
the fdic is required to attain this ratio by september  in december  the fdic approved a final rule raising its industry target ratio of reserves to insured deposits to  basis points above the statutory minimum  but the fdic does not project that goal to be met until in addition  the dodd frank act will have a significant impact on the calculation of deposit insurance assessment premiums going forward 
specifically  the dodd frank act generally requires the fdic to define the deposit insurance assessment base for an insured depository institution as an amount equal to the institution s average consolidated total assets during the assessment period minus average tangible equity 
the fdic issued a final rule that implements this change to the assessment calculation on february   but has said that the new assessment rate schedule should result in the collection of assessment revenue that is approximately revenue neutral although the amounts that individual depository institutions will pay may 
table of contents change even though the new assessment base under the dodd frank act is larger than the current assessment base 
as presently done under the current rule  the assessment rate of a depository institution will be determined according to its supervisory ratings and capital levels  with adjustments for the depository institution s unsecured debt and brokered deposits 
the deposit insurance rates for depository institutions under the new rule will range from to basis points per of the assessment base average consolidated assets minus average tangible equity 
the new rule will take effect for the quarter beginning april   and will be reflected in the june  fund balance and the invoices for assessments due september  the fdic rule also provides the fdic s board with the flexibility to adopt actual rates that are higher or lower than the total base assessment rates adopted without notice and comment  if certain conditions are met 
under the current rule  the amount of the assessment is a function of the institution s risk category  of which there are four  and the assessment base 
an institution s risk category is determined according to its supervisory ratings and capital levels and is used to determine the institution s assessment rate 
the assessment rate for risk categories is calculated according to a formula  which relies on supervisory ratings and either financial ratios or long term debt ratings 
an insured bank s assessment base is determined by the balance of its insured deposits 
because the system is risk based  it allows banks to pay lower assessments to the fdic as their capital levels and supervisory ratings improve 
by the same token  if these indicators deteriorate  the institution will have to pay higher assessments to the fdic 
as of december   deposit insurance rates for depository institutions range from to basis points per of assessable deposits based upon assessment rates that are calculated based upon the depository institution s risk rating as adjusted by its levels of unsecured debt  secured liabilities  and brokered deposits 
under the fdia  the fdic also has the authority to impose special assessments upon insured depository institutions when deemed necessary by the fdic s board 
the fdic adopted a final rule  in may  effective june   that imposed a special assessment of five cents for every on each insured depository institution s assets minus its tier capital as of june   subject to a cap equal to cents per of assessable deposits for the second quarter of on september   in order to strengthen the cash position of the fdic s deposit insurance fund  the fdic issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would require our banking subsidiaries to prepay their estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of and for all of  and under the proposed rule each institution s deposit assessment base would be calculated using its third quarter deposit assessment base  adjusted quarterly for an estimated percent annual growth rate in the deposit assessment base through the end of the prepaid assessment would be collected on december  and would be mandatory for all institutions subject to the exercise of the fdic s discretion to exempt an institution if the fdic determines that the prepayment would affect the safety and soundness of the institution 
the fdic adopted the final rule implementing the prepayment of assessments on november  our total prepaid assessments were million  which according to the final rule were recorded as a prepaid expense as of december  the prepaid assessments will be amortized and recognized as an expense over the following three years 
the deposit insurance funds act of separated the financing corporation assessment to service the interest on its bond obligations from the dif assessments 
the amount assessed on individual institutions by the financing corporation is in addition to the amount paid for deposit insurance according to the fdic s risk related assessment rate schedules 
the current financing corporation annual assessment rate is to per of deposits 
these assessments will continue until the financing corporation bonds mature in as of december   doral bank pr and doral bank us had a dif deposit base of approximately billion and million  respectively 

table of contents temporary fdic insurance of non interest bearing transaction accounts the dodd frank act amended the fdia to fully insure the amounts deposited in non interest bearing transaction accounts at all insured depository institutions from december  until december  this amendment became effective on december   which is the date that the fdic s transaction account guarantee tag program terminated 
the new program applies to all insured depository institutions  while the tag program applied to only to insured depository institutions that opted in doral bank pr and doral bank us had opted in to the tag program 
under the new program  low interest checking now accounts will no longer be eligible for unlimited deposit insurance 
this unlimited insurance coverage for non interest bearing transaction accounts is separate from  and in addition to  the insurance coverage provided to a depositor s other deposit accounts held at an fdic insured institution 
fdic insured depository institutions are not permitted to opt out of this temporary insurance program and the fdic will not charge a separate assessment for this coverage 
community reinvestment under the community reinvestment act cra  each insured depository institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation  consistent with the safe and sound operation of such institution  to help meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for such institutions nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community  consistent with the cra 
the cra requires each federal banking agency  in connection with its examination of an insured depository institution  to assess and assign one of four ratings to the institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such records into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the institution  including application for charters  branches and other deposit facilities  relocations  mergers  consolidations  acquisitions of assets or assumptions of liabilities and savings and loan holding company acquisitions 
the cra also requires that all institutions make public disclosure of their cra ratings 
doral bank pr and doral bank us received ratings of satisfactory as of the most recent cra report of the fdic and the ots  respectively 
safety and soundness standards section of the fdia  as amended by fdicia  requires each federal banking agency to prescribe for all insured depository institutions that it supervises safety and soundness standards relating to internal control  information systems and internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  compensation  fees and benefits and such other operational and managerial standards as the federal banking agency deems appropriate 
if an insured depository institution fails to meet any of the standards described above  it may be required to submit to the appropriate federal banking agency a plan specifying the steps that will be taken to cure the deficiency 
if the depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan or fails to implement the plan  the appropriate federal banking agency will require the depository institution to correct the deficiency and  until it is corrected  may impose other restrictions on the depository institution  including any of the restrictions applicable under the prompt corrective action provisions of the fdicia 
the fdic and other federal banking agencies have adopted interagency guidelines establishing standards for safety and soundness that  among other things  set forth standards relating to internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  employee compensation and benefits  asset growth and earnings 
interagency appraisal and evaluation guidelines in december  the federal banking agencies issued the interagency appraisal and evaluation guidelines 
this guidance  which updated guidance originally issued in  sets forth the minimum regulatory standards for appraisals 
in incorporates previous regulatory issuances affecting appraisals  addresses advances in information technology used in collateral evaluation  and clarifies standards for use of analytical 
table of contents methods and technological tools in developing evaluations 
this guidance also requires institutions to utilize strong internal controls to ensure reliable appraisals and evaluations and periodically update valuations of collaterals for existing real estate loans and transactions 
brokered deposits fdic regulations adopted under fdicia govern the receipt of brokered deposits by insured depository institutions 
under these regulations  a bank cannot accept  roll over or renew brokered deposits which term is defined also to include any deposit with an interest rate more than basis points above certain prevailing rates specified by regulation unless i it is well capitalized  or ii it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the fdic 
a bank that is adequately capitalized may not pay an interest rate on any deposits in excess of basis points over certain prevailing market rates specified by regulation 
there are no such restrictions on a bank that is well capitalized 
doral financial does not believe the brokered deposits regulation has had or will have a material effect on the funding or liquidity of its banking subsidiaries  which are currently well capitalized institutions 
as of december  and  doral bank pr had a total of approximately billion and billion of brokered deposits  respectively 
doral bank pr uses brokered deposits as a source of less costly funding 
as of december   doral bank us had a total of approximately million of brokered deposits  compared to million as of december  federal home loan bank system doral bank pr is a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb system 
the fhlb system consists of twelve regional federal home loan banks governed and regulated by the federal housing finance agency 
the federal home loan banks serve as reserve or credit facilities for member institutions within their assigned regions 
they are funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the fhlb system  and they make loans advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the fhlb system and the board of directors of each regional fhlb 
doral bank pr is a member of the fhlb of new york fhlb ny and as such is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the fhlb ny for a certain amount  which is calculated in accordance with the requirements set forth in applicable laws and regulations 
doral bank pr is in compliance with the stock ownership requirements of the fhlb ny 
all loans  advances and other extensions of credit made by the fhlb ny to doral bank pr are secured by a portion of doral bank pr s mortgage loan portfolio  certain other investments and the capital stock of the fhlb ny held by doral bank pr 
doral bank us is also a member of the fhlb ny and is subject to similar requirements as those of doral bank pr described above 
activity restrictions on state chartered banks section of the fdia  as amended by fdicia  generally provides that state chartered banks and their subsidiaries are limited in their investment and activities engaged in as principal to those permissible under state law and that are permissible to national banks and their subsidiaries  unless such investments and principal activities are specifically permitted by the fdia or the fdic determines that such activity or investment would pose no significant risk to the dif and the banks are  and continue to be  in compliance with applicable capital standards 
any insured state chartered bank directly or indirectly engaged in any activity that is not permitted for a national bank must cease the impermissible activity 
usa patriot act of on october   the president of the united states signed into law comprehensive anti terrorism legislation known as the usa patriot act of the usa patriot act 
title iii of the usa patriot act substantially broadened the scope of us anti money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant 
table of contents new compliance and due diligence obligations  creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra territorial jurisdiction of the united states 
the us treasury department treasury has issued a number of regulations implementing the usa patriot act that apply certain of its requirements to financial institutions  including doral financial s banking subsidiaries 
the regulations impose new obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies  procedures and controls to detect  prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing 
among other requirements  the usa patriot act and the related regulations require financial institutions to establish anti money laundering programs that include  at a minimum internal policies  procedures and controls designed to implement and maintain the depository institution s compliance with all of the requirements of the usa patriot act  the bank secrecy act and related laws and regulations  systems and procedures for monitoring and reporting of suspicious transactions and activities  employee training  an independent audit function to test the anti money laundering program  procedures to verify the identity of each customer upon the opening of accounts  and heightened due diligence policies  procedures and controls applicable to certain foreign accounts and relationships 
failure of a financial institution to comply with the usa patriot act s requirements could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution 
doral financial believes that the cost of complying with title iii of the usa patriot act is not likely to be material to doral financial 
doral bank pr was subject to a consent order with the fdic relating to failure to comply with certain requirements of the bank secrecy act 
the order required doral bank pr  among other things  to engage an independent consultant to review account and transaction activity from april  through march  to determine compliance with suspicious activity reporting requirements the look back review 
the fdic terminated the consent order on september  since the look back review was still ongoing  doral bank pr and the fdic agreed to a memorandum of understanding that covered the remaining portion of the look back review 
on june   doral bank received a notification letter from the fdic terminating the memorandum of understanding because the look back review had been completed 
please refer to item legal proceedings banking regulatory matters  for additional information regarding the terminated consent order relating to compliance with various provisions of the bank secrecy act 
transactions with affiliates and related parties transactions between one of the banking subsidiaries of the company and any of its affiliates are governed by sections a and b of the federal reserve act 
these sections are important statutory provisions designed to protect a depository institution from transferring to its affiliates the subsidy arising from the institution s access to the federal safety net on deposits 
an affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls  is controlled by or is under common control with the bank 
generally  sections a and b limit the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to of the bank s capital stock and surplus  and limit such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to of the bank s capital stock and surplus  and require that all such transactions be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
the term covered transactions includes the making of loans  purchase of or investment in securities issued by the affiliate  purchase of assets  issuance of guarantees and other similar types of transactions 
most loans by a bank to any of its affiliates must be secured by collateral in amounts ranging from to percent of the loan amount  depending on the nature of the collateral 
in addition  any covered transaction by a bank with an affiliate and any sale of assets or provision of services to an affiliate must be on terms that are substantially the same  or at least as favorable to the bank  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies 

table of contents regulation w of the federal reserve board comprehensively implements sections a and b 
the regulation unified and updated federal reserve board staff interpretations issued over the years prior to its adoption  incorporated several interpretative proposals such as to clarify when transactions with an unrelated third party will be attributed to an affiliate  and addressed issues arising as a result of the expanded scope of non banking activities engaged in by banks and bank holding companies and authorized for financial holding companies under the gramm leach bliley act 
the dodd frank act also changed the definition of covered transaction in sections a and b and established limitations on asset purchases from insiders 
with respect to the definition of covered transaction  the dodd frank act defines that term to include the acceptance of debt obligations issued by an affiliate as collateral for a bank s loan or extension of credit to another person or company 
in addition  a derivative transaction with an affiliate is now deemed to be a covered transaction to the extent that such a transaction causes a bank or its subsidiary to have a credit exposure to the affiliate 
a separate provision of the dodd frank act states that an insured depository institution may not purchase an asset from  or sell an asset to a bank insider or their related interests unless the transaction is conducted on market terms between the parties  and if the proposed transaction represents more than of the capital stock and surplus of the insured institution  it has been approved in advance by a majority of the institution s non interested directors 
sections g and h of the federal reserve act set forth restrictions on loans by a bank to its executive officers  directors  and principal shareholders

certain regulatory restrictions on investments in common stock because of doral financial s status as a bank holding company  owners of doral financial s common stock are subject to certain restrictions and disclosure obligations under various federal laws  including the bhc act 
regulations pursuant to the bhc act generally require prior federal reserve approval for an acquisition of control of an insured institution as defined or holding company thereof by any person or persons acting in concert 
control is deemed to exist if  among other things  a person or persons acting in concert acquires more than of any class of voting stock of an insured institution or holding company thereof

changes to legislation or regulation changes to federal and local laws and regulations including changes in interpretation and enforcement can affect the operating environment of the company and its subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways 
from time to time  various legislative and regulatory proposals are introduced 
these proposals  if adopted  may change laws and regulations and the company s operating environment 
if adopted  some of these laws and regulations could increase or decrease the cost of doing business  limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks  savings institutions  credit unions and other financial institutions 
the company cannot accurately predict whether those changes in laws and regulations will occur  and  if those changes occur  the ultimate effect they would have upon our financial condition or results of operations 
it is likely  however  that the current high level of enforcement and compliance related activities of federal and puerto rico authorities will continue and potentially increase

we cannot assure you that the risk factors described below or elsewhere in this document are a complete set of all potential risks we may face

please also refer to the section titled forward looking statements in this annual report on form k 
risks related to the general business environment and our industry difficult market conditions have already affected us and our industry and may continue to adversely affect us 
given that almost all of our business is in puerto rico and the united states and given the degree of interrelation between puerto rico s economy and that of the united states  we are particularly exposed to downturns in the us economy 
dramatic declines in the us housing market over the past few years  with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures  unemployment and under employment  have negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage loans and resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions  including government sponsored entities as well as major commercial banks and investment banks 
these write downs  initially of mortgage backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivative and cash securities  in turn  have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital from private and government entities  to merge with larger and stronger financial institutions and  in some cases  to fail 
reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors reduced or ceased providing funding to borrowers  including other financial institutions 
this market turmoil and tightening of credit led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies  lack of consumer confidence  increased market volatility and widespread reduction of business activity generally 
the resulting economic pressure on consumers and lack of confidence in the financial markets has already adversely affected our industry and has and may continue to adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company experienced increased levels of non performing assets and otti charges on its non agency mbss as a result of market conditions 
we do not 
table of contents expect that the difficult conditions in the financial markets are likely to improve in the near future 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial institutions industry 
in particular  we may face the following risks in connection with these events our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the models and approaches we use to select  manage  and underwrite our customers become less predictive of future behaviors 
the processes and models we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure requires difficult  subjective  and complex judgments  including forecast of economic conditions and how these economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans  which may no longer be capable of accurate estimation and which may  in turn  impact the reliability of the processes and models 
regulatory agency views of market conditions and the effect of market conditions on our borrowers may differ from those of management  and such variance in views  if any  may contribute to changes in charge offs and loan loss provisions 
our ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to engage in sales of mortgage loans to third parties including mortgage loan securitization transactions with government sponsored entities on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by further disruptions in the capital markets or other events  including deteriorating investor expectations 
competition in our industry could intensify as a result of increasing consolidation of financial services companies in connection with current market conditions 
we expect to face increased regulation of our industry 
compliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities 
we may be required to pay in the future significantly higher fdic assessments to insure our deposits if market conditions do not improve or if market conditions deteriorate 
we may face higher credit losses because of federal or state legislation or regulatory action that either i reduces the amount that our borrowers are required to pay us  or ii limits our ability to foreclose on properties or collateral or makes foreclosures less economically viable 
if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  our ability to access capital and our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
adverse credit market conditions may affect the company s ability to meet its liquidity needs  unforeseen disruptions in the brokered deposits market could compromise the company s liquidity position 
the credit markets  although recovering  have experienced extreme volatility and disruption 
at times during the past few years  the volatility and disruptions reached unprecedented levels 
in some cases  the markets have exerted downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity of certain issuers  particularly for non investment grade issuers like us 
we need liquidity to  among other things  pay our operating expenses  interest on our debt and dividends on our preferred stock if dividends are declared and paid  maintain our lending activities and replace certain maturing liabilities 
without sufficient liquidity  we may be forced to curtail our operations 
the availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions  the general availability of credit and our credit capacity 
our cash flows and financial condition could be materially affected by continued disruptions in the financial markets 
a relatively large portion of our funding is retail brokered deposits issued by doral bank pr 
the company s total brokered deposits as of december  were billion 
an unforeseen disruption in the brokered deposits market  stemming from factors such as legal  regulatory or financial risks  could adversely affect our ability to fund a portion of our operations and or meet obligations 

table of contents our business concentration in puerto rico imposes risks 
we conduct our operations in a geographically concentrated area  as our main market is in puerto rico 
this imposes risks from lack of diversification in the geographical portfolio 
the company s financial condition and results of operations are highly dependent on the economic conditions of puerto rico  where adverse political or economic developments or natural disasters  among other things  could affect the volume of loan originations  increase the level of non performing assets  increase the rate of foreclosure losses and reduce the value of our loans and loan servicing portfolio 
our credit quality may continue to be adversely affected by puerto rico s current economic conditions 
the company s business activities and credit exposure are concentrated in puerto rico 
consequently  our financial condition and results of operations are highly dependent on economic conditions in puerto rico 
puerto rico s economy is currently in a recession that began in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year that ended june  although the puerto rico economy is closely linked to the united states economy  for fiscal years  and  puerto rico s real gross national product decreased by  and  respectively  while the united states economy grew at a rate of and during fiscal years and  respectively  and contracted at a rate of during fiscal year according to the puerto rico planning board s latest projections  puerto rico s real gross national product was projected to contract by during fiscal year puerto rico s real gross national product for fiscal year  however  is projected to grow by 
the number of persons employed in puerto rico during fiscal year averaged  a decrease of compared to the previous fiscal year 
during the first six months of fiscal year  total employment averaged  a decline of compared with the same period of the previous fiscal year  and the unemployment rate averaged 
since  the government of puerto rico has experienced a structural imbalance between recurring government revenues and total expenditures 
the structural imbalance was exacerbated during fiscal years and  with recurring government expenditures significantly exceeding recurring government revenues 
prior to fiscal year  the puerto rico government bridged the deficit resulting from the structural imbalance through the use of non recurring measures  such as borrowing from the government development bank for puerto rico or in the bond market  postponing the payment of various government expenses  such as payments to suppliers and utilities providers  and other one time measures such as the use of derivatives and borrowings collateralized with government assets such as real estate 
since march  the government has taken multiple steps to address and resolve the structural imbalance 
for fiscal year  the deficit was approximately billion  consisting of the difference between revenues and expenses for such fiscal year 
the estimated deficit is projected to be approximately billion for fiscal year and approximately billion for fiscal year measures that the government of puerto rico has implemented have included reducing expenses  including public sector employment through layoffs of employees 
since the government of puerto rico is the largest source of employment in puerto rico  these measures have had the effect of increasing unemployment and could have the effect of intensifying the current recessionary cycle 
in addition  a payment or other material default by the government of puerto rico or any of its agencies  public corporations or instrumentalities with respect to their municipal bond or note obligations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the current state of the puerto rico economy and continued uncertainty in the public and private sectors has had an adverse effect on the credit quality of our loan portfolios and reduced the level of our originations in puerto rico 
the continuation of the economic slowdown would cause those adverse effects to continue  as delinquency rates may continue to increase in the short term  until sustainable growth of the puerto rico economy resumes 
also  potential reduction in consumer spending as a result of continued recessionary conditions may also impact growth in other interest and non interest revenue sources of the company 

table of contents a prolonged economic slowdown or decline in the residential real estate market in the us mainland and in puerto rico and an increase in the continued unemployment in puerto rico could continue to adversely affect our results of operations 
the residential mortgage loan origination business has historically been cyclical  enjoying periods of strong growth and profitability followed by periods of shrinking volumes and industry wide losses 
the market for residential mortgage loan originations is currently in decline and this trend could also reduce the level of mortgage loans we may produce in the future and adversely affect our business 
during periods of rising interest rates  refinancing originations for many mortgage products tend to decrease as the economic incentives for borrowers to refinance their existing mortgage loans are reduced 
in addition  the residential mortgage loan origination business is impacted by home values 
over the past three years  residential real estate values in many areas of the us have decreased significantly  which has led to lower volumes and higher losses across the industry  adversely impacting our mortgage business 
the actual rates of delinquencies  foreclosures and losses on loans have been higher during the recent economic slowdown 
rising unemployment  higher interest rates or declines in housing prices have had a greater negative effect on the ability of borrowers to repay their mortgage loans 
any sustained period of increased delinquencies  foreclosures or losses could continue to harm our ability to sell loans  the prices we receive for loans  the values of mortgage loans held for sale or residual interests in securitizations  which could continue to harm our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  any additional material decline in real estate values would further weaken the collateral loan to value ratios and increase the possibility of loss if a borrower defaults 
in such event  we will be subject to the risk of loss on such loan arising from borrower defaults to the extent not covered by third party credit enhancement 
the soundness of other financial institutions could affect us 
our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty and other relationships 
we have exposure to different industries and counterparties  and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment banks  investment companies and other institutional clients 
in certain of these transactions  we are required to post collateral to secure our obligations to the counterparties 
in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding involving one of such counterparties  we may experience delays in recovering the assets posted as collateral or may incur a loss to the extent that the counterparty was holding collateral in excess of the obligation to such counterparty 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by our counterparty or client 
in addition  our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us 
any such losses could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
monetary policies and regulations of the federal reserve could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to being affected by general economic conditions  our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the federal reserve 
an important function of the federal reserve is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions 
among the instruments used by the federal reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in us government securities  adjustments of the discount rate and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits 
these instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit  bank loans  investments and deposits 
their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits 
on january   the member agencies of the federal financial institutions examination council  which includes the federal reserve and the fdic  issued an interest rate risk advisory reminding banks to maintain sound practices for managing interest rate risk  particularly in the current environment of historically low short term interest rates 

table of contents the monetary policies and regulations of the federal reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
the effects of such policies upon our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adverse 
our income and cash flows depend to a great extent on the difference between the interest rates earned on interest earning assets such as loans and investment securities  and the interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies in particular  the federal reserve 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  will influence the origination of loans  the prepayment speed of loans  the value of loans  investment securities and mortgage servicing assets  the purchase of investments  the generation of deposits  and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits or other sources of funding 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act will affect our business 
on july   president obama signed into law the dodd frank act 
the legislation is making significant structural reforms to the financial services industry 
the legislation  among other things  is i establishing a bureau of consumer financial protection having broad authority to regulate providers of credit  savings and other consumer financial products and services  narrows the scope of federal preemption of state consumer laws and expands the authority of state attorneys general to bring actions to enforce federal consumer protection legislation  ii creating a structure to regulate systematically important financial companies  and provide regulators with the power to require such companies to sell or transfer assets and terminate activities if the regulators determine the size or the scope of the activities of the company pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the company or the financial stability of the united states  iii requiring more comprehensive regulation of the over the counter derivatives market  including providing for more strict capital and margin requirements  the central clearing of standardized over the counter derivatives  and heightened supervision of all over the counter derivatives dealers and major market participants  iv limiting the ability of banking entities to engage in certain proprietary trading activities and restricting their ownership of  investment in or sponsorship of hedge funds and private equity funds  v restricting the interchange fees payable on debit card transactions  vi abolishing the office of thrift supervision ots and transferring its functions and responsibilities regarding the supervision of federal savings banks  such as doral bank us  to the office of the comptroller of the currency occ  vii strengthening the regulatory oversight of securities and capital markets activities by the us securities and exchange commission sec and enhancing the safety and soundness of the securitization process  including a requirement that securitizers and originators retain a portion of the credit risk for any asset that they securitize or originate  viii permanently increasing the federal deposit insurance from  to  permitting depository institutions to pay interest on demand deposit accounts such as commercial checking accounts and permitting de novo interstate branching by federal and state depository institutions alike  and ix strengthening existing laws and regulations applicable to public companies governing corporate accountability  giving shareholders say on pay and other corporate governance rights  and imposing limitations on certain executive compensation practices 
some of the provisions of the legislation have already become effective 
other provisions will have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates  and will be required to be implemented through 
table of contents regulatory action of various federal regulatory authorities 
because many of the provisions require future regulatory actions for their implementation  the ultimate impact of the legislation on the financial services industry and on our business  are not completely known at this time 
the implementation of many of the provisions of the legislation will affect our business and are expected to add new regulatory risk and compliance burdens and costs on the financial services industry and us 
the implementation of this legislation could result in loss of revenue  limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities we might otherwise consider engaging in  impact the value of some of the assets we hold  require us to change certain of our business practices  impose additional costs on us  establish more stringent capital  liquidity and leverage ratio requirements  or otherwise adversely affect our business 
the company operates within a highly regulated industry and its business and results are significantly affected by the regulations to which it is subject  changes in statutes and regulations could adversely affect the company 
we operate within a highly regulated environment 
the regulations to which the company is subject will continue to have a significant impact on the company s operations and the degree to which it can grow and be profitable 
certain regulators which supervise the company have significant power in reviewing the company s operations and approving its business practices 
these powers include the ability to place limitations or conditions on activities in which the company engages or intends to engage 
particularly in recent years  the company s businesses have experienced increased regulation and regulatory scrutiny  often requiring additional company resources 
current economic conditions  particularly in the financial markets  have resulted in government regulatory agencies and political bodies placing increased focus and scrutiny on the financial services industry 
the us government has intervened on an unprecedented scale  responding to what has been commonly referred to as the financial crisis  by enhancing the liquidity support available to financial institutions  establishing a commercial paper funding facility  temporarily guaranteeing money market funds and certain types of debt issuances  and increasing insurance on bank deposits 
these programs have subjected participating financial institutions to additional restrictions  oversight and costs 
in addition  new proposals for legislation continue to be introduced in the us congress that could further increase regulation of the financial services industry and impose restrictions on the operations and general ability of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices 
federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied 
we cannot predict the substance or impact of any change in regulation  whether by regulators or as a result of legislation enacted by the united states congress or by the puerto rico legislature  or in the way such statutory or regulatory requirements are interpreted or enforced 
compliance with such current and potential regulation and scrutiny may significantly increase our costs  impede the efficiency of our internal business practices  require us to increase our regulatory capital and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner 
further increases in the fdic insurance assessment premiums or required reserves may have a significant impact on us 
the fdic insures deposits at fdic insured depository institutions up to certain limits 
the fdic charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the deposit insurance fund the dif 
current economic conditions have resulted in higher bank failures and expectations of future bank failures 
in the event of a bank failure  the fdic takes control of a failed bank and ensures payment of deposits up to insured limits which have recently been increased using the resources of the dif 
the fdic is required by law to maintain adequate funding of the dif  and the fdic may increase premium assessments to maintain such funding 
on november   the fdic adopted the final rule implementing a prepayment assessment for the fourth quarter of and for all of  and in order to strengthen the cash position of the dif 
the company s total prepaid assessment was million  which according to the final rule was recorded as 
table of contents a prepaid expense as of december  the prepaid assessment will be amortized and recognized by the company as an expense over the period from to the dodd frank act requires the fdic to increase the dif s reserves against future losses  which will necessitate increased deposit insurance premiums that are expected to be borne primarily by institutions with assets of greater than billion 
in october  the fdic addressed plans to bolster the dif by increasing the required reserve ratio for the industry to percent ratio of reserves to insured deposits by september   as required by the dodd frank act 
in december  the fdic approved a final rule raising its industry target ratio of reserves to insured deposits to percent  basis points above the statutory minimum  but the fdic does not project that goal to be met until on february   the fdic approved a final rule that amends its current deposit insurance assessment regulations 
the final rule implements a provision in the dodd frank act that changes the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums from one based on domestic deposits to one based on average consolidated total assets minus average tier capital 
the final rule also changes the assessment rate schedules for insured depository institutions so that approximately the same amount of revenue would be collected under the new assessment base as would be collected under the current rate schedule and the schedules previously proposed by the fdic in october the final rule also revises the risk based assessment system for all large insured depository institutions generally  institutions with at least billion in total assets 
under the proposed rule  the fdic would use a scorecard method to calculate assessment rates for all such institutions 
as noted by the fdic in the final rule it adopted  the final rule should keep the overall amount collected from the industry very close to unchanged  although the amounts that individual institutions pay will be different 
the new large bank pricing system is expected to result in higher assessments for banks with high risk asset concentrations  less stable balance sheet liquidity  or potentially higher loss severity in the event of failure 
we are generally unable to control the amount of assessments that we are required to pay for fdic insurance 
if there are additional bank or financial institution failures  or if our risk rating deteriorates for purposes of determining the level of our fdic insurance assessments  we may be required to pay even higher fdic insurance assessments than the recently increased levels 
any future increases in fdic insurance assessments may materially adversely affect our results of operations 
the consolidation of the puerto rico banking industry as a result of bank failures in may adversely affect us 
in april  the fdic closed three puerto rico banks and sold some of their assets and liabilities to other banks in puerto rico 
in the future  there may be additional bank failures  mergers and acquisitions in our industry 
any business combinations could significantly alter industry conditions and competition within the puerto rico banking industry and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the strategies adopted by the fdic and the three acquiring banks in connection with some of the residential  construction and commercial real estate loans acquired may adversely affect residential and commercial real estate values in puerto rico 
this in turn may adversely affect the value of some of our residential  construction and commercial real estate loans  and our ability to sell or restructure some of our residential  construction and commercial real estate loans 
changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect the company s financial statements 
our financial statements are subject to the application of gaap  which are periodically revised and or expanded 
accordingly  from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board the fasb 
the impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed by the company in its filings with the sec 
an 
table of contents assessment of proposed standards is not provided as such proposals are still subject to change 
it is possible that future accounting standards that the company is required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that the company applies to its consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to our business deteriorating credit quality has adversely impacted the company and may continue to adversely impact the company 
the company s has experienced a downturn in credit quality since the company s credit quality has continued to be under pressure during as a result of continued recessionary conditions in puerto rico and the recent slow down in consumer activity and economic growth in the united states that have led to  among other things  higher unemployment levels  much lower absorption rates for new residential construction projects and further declines in property values 
the company expects that credit conditions and the performance of its loan portfolio may continue to deteriorate in the near future 
our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers and counterparties and the value of the assets securing our loans or underlying our investments 
if the credit quality of the customer base materially decreases  if the risk profile of a market  industry or group of customers changes materially  our business  financial condition  allowance levels  asset impairments  liquidity  capital and results of operations could be adversely affected 
the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio and as such it may not be adequate to cover the actual portfolio losses 
as a result  future loan loss provisions may be required 
the company establishes an allowance for loan and lease losses at a level estimated as the amount of incurred losses inherent in the portfolio as of the related financial statement date based upon analysis of past portfolio default trends  severity experience  and fair value estimates  and records a provision for loan and lease losses which adjusts the allowance for loan and lease loss balance to the estimated amount as a charge to current period income 
the allowance for loan and leases is an estimate of incurred losses in the loan portfolio made pursuant to accounting guidance  that by accounting principles does not consider or estimate all future losses that will be incurred 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies  such as fdic and the office of the commissioner  periodically review the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses or loan charge offs 
accordingly  additional loan loss provisions may be required  and such provisions may materially affect our results of operations  financial condition and capital 
changes in collateral values of properties located in recessionary economies may require increased reserves 
the performance of our loan portfolio and the collateral value backing the loan transactions are dependent upon the performance of and conditions within each specific real estate market 
recent economic reports related to the real estate market in puerto rico indicate that certain pockets of the real estate market are subject to readjustments in value driven not by demand but more by the purchasing power of the consumers and general recessionary economic conditions 
we measure the impairment of a loan based on the fair value of the collateral  if collateral dependent  which is generally obtained from appraisals 
updated appraisals are requested when we determine that loans are impaired and are updated annually thereafter 
in addition  appraisals are also obtained for certain residential mortgage loans on a spot basis based on specific characteristics such as delinquency levels  age of the appraisal and ltv ratios 
the appraised value of the collateral may decrease or we may not be able to recover collateral at its appraised value 
a significant decline in collateral valuations for collateral dependent loans may require increases in our specific provision for loan losses and an increase in the general valuation allowance 
any such increase would have an adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents interest rate shifts may reduce net interest income 
shifts in short term interest rates may reduce net interest income  which is the principal component of our earnings 
net interest income is the difference between the amounts received by us on our interest earning assets and the interest paid by us on our interest bearing liabilities 
when interest rates rise  the rate of interest we pay on our liabilities generally rises more quickly than the rate of interest that we receive on our interest bearing assets  which may cause our profits to decrease 
the impact on earnings is more adverse when the slope of the yield curve flattens  that is  when short term interest rates increase more than long term interest rates or when long term interest rates decrease more than short term interest rates 
increases in interest rates may reduce the value of holdings of securities and demand for mortgage and other loans 
fixed rate securities acquired by us are generally subject to decreases in market value when interest rates rise  which may require recognition of a loss eg  the identification of other than temporary impairment on our investments portfolio  thereby adversely affecting our results of operations 
market related reductions in value also influence our ability to finance these securities 
higher interest rates also increase the cost of mortgage and other loans to consumers and businesses and may reduce demand for such loans  which may negatively impact our profits by reducing the amount of our loan origination income 
the company and its banking subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital adequacy and other supervisory guidelines  and if we fail to meet those guidelines our business and financial condition would be adversely affected 
under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements  our banking subsidiaries must meet guidelines that include quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items  subject to quantitative judgments by regulators regarding components  risk weightings and other factors 
supervisory guidelines also address  among other things  asset quality and liquidity 
if the company and its banking subsidiaries fail to meet these minimum capital and other supervisory and regulatory requirements  our business and financial condition will be adversely affected 
a failure to meet regulatory capital adequacy guidelines  among other things  would affect our banking subsidiaries ability to accept or rollover brokered deposits and could result in supervisory actions by federal and or puerto rico banking authorities 
the hedging transactions that the company enters into may not be effective in managing the exposure to interest rate risk 
the company uses derivatives  to a limited extent  to manage part of its exposure to market risk caused by changes in interest rates 
the derivative instruments that the company may use also have their own risks  which include i basis risk  which is the risk of loss associated with variations in the spread between the asset yield and funding and or hedge cost  ii credit or default risk  which is the risk of insolvency or other inability of the counterparty to a particular transaction to perform its obligations  and iii legal risk  which is the risk that the company is unable to enforce the terms of such instruments 
all or any of these risks could expose the company to losses 
our risk management policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk  which could negatively affect us 
management of risk requires  among other things  policies and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events 
we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future 
nonetheless  our policies and procedures may not be comprehensive given current market conditions 
some of our methods for managing risk and exposures are based upon the use of observed historical market behavior or statistics based on historical models 
as a result  these methods may not fully predict future exposures  which could be significantly greater than our historical measures indicate 
other risk management methods depend on the 
table of contents evaluation of information regarding markets  clients or other matters that is publicly available or otherwise accessible to us 
this information may not always be accurate  complete  up to date or properly evaluated 
the preparation of our financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make significant estimates that affect our financial statements 
three of the company s most critical estimates are the level of the allowance for loan and lease losses  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights  and the amount of its deferred tax asset 
due to the inherent nature of these estimates the company may significantly increase the allowance for loan and lease losses and or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance  and may recognize a significant provision for impairment of its mortgage servicing rights 
if the company s allowance for loan and lease losses is not adequate  the company s business  financial condition  including its liquidity and capital  and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
additionally  in the future  the company may increase its allowance for loan and lease losses  which could have a material adverse effect on its capital and results of operations 
as of december   the company had a deferred tax asset of approximately million 
the deferred tax asset is net of a valuation allowance of million 
the realization of the company s deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income to realize the value of this asset 
due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances  it is reasonably possible that the company will be required to record adjustments to the valuation allowance in future reporting periods 
the company s results of operations would be negatively impacted if it determines that increases to its deferred tax asset valuation allowance are required in a future reporting period 
defective and repurchased loans may harm our business and financial condition 
in connection with the sale and securitization of mortgage loans  the company is required to make a variety of customary representations and warranties regarding the company and the loans being sold or securitized 
the company s obligations with respect to these representations and warranties are generally outstanding for the life of the loan  and they relate to  among other things compliance with laws and regulations  underwriting standards  the accuracy of information in the loan documents and loan file  and the characteristics and enforceability of the loan 
a loan that does not comply with these representations and warranties may take longer to sell  may impact the company s ability to obtain third party financing for the loan  and be unsalable or salable only at a significant discount 
if such a loan is sold before the company detects a noncompliance  the company may be obligated to repurchase the loan and bear any associated loss directly  or the company may be obligated to indemnify the purchaser against any such loss  either of which could reduce the company s cash available for operations and liquidity 
the company s management believes that it has established controls to ensure that loans are originated in accordance with the secondary market s requirements  but mistakes may be made  or certain employees may deliberately violate the company s lending policies 
the company seeks to minimize repurchases and losses from defective loans by correcting flaws  if possible  and selling or re selling such loans 
the company does not have a reserve on its financial statements for possible losses related to repurchases resulting from representation and warranty violations because it does not expect any such losses to be significant 
losses associated with defective loans may adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents we are exposed to credit risk from mortgage loans held pending sale and mortgage loans that have been sold subject to recourse arrangements 
the company is generally at risk for mortgage loan defaults from the time it funds a loan until the time the loan is sold or securitized into a mortgage backed security 
in the past  the company retained  through recourse arrangements  part of the credit risk on sales of mortgage loans that did not qualify for gnma  fnma or fhlmc sale or exchange programs and consequently may suffer losses on these loans 
the company suffers losses on these loans when the proceeds from a foreclosure sale of the property underlying a defaulted mortgage loan are less than the outstanding principal balance of the loan and the costs of holding and disposing of the related property 
the company estimates the fair value of the retained recourse obligation or any liability incurred at the time of sale and includes such obligation with the net proceeds from the sale  resulting in lower gain on sale recognition 
the company evaluates the fair value of its recourse obligation based on historical losses from foreclosure and disposition of mortgage loans adjusted for expectations of changes in portfolio behavior and market environment 
we are subject to risks in servicing loans for others 
the company s profitability may also be adversely affected by mortgage loan delinquencies and defaults on mortgage loans that it services for third parties 
under many of its servicing contracts  the company must advance all or part of the scheduled payments to the owner of an outstanding mortgage loan  even when mortgage loan payments are delinquent 
in addition  in order to protect their liens on mortgaged properties  owners of mortgage loans usually require that the company  as servicer  pay mortgage and hazard insurance and tax payments on schedule even if sufficient escrow funds are not available 
the company generally recovers its advances from the mortgage owner or from liquidation proceeds when the mortgage loan is foreclosed 
however  in the interim  the company must absorb the cost of the funds it advances during the time the advance is outstanding 
the company must also bear the costs of attempting to collect on delinquent and defaulted mortgage loans 
in addition  if a default is not cured  the mortgage loan will be canceled as part of the foreclosure proceedings and the company will not receive any future servicing income with respect to that loan 
as a result of our credit ratings  we may be subjected to increased collateral requirements and other measures that could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
we have previously sold or securitized mortgage loans in transactions with fnma and other counterparties subject to partial or full recourse 
as of december   the maximum contractual exposure to the company if it were required to purchase all loans sold subject to partial or full recourse was billion  billion of which consisted of exposure to fnma 
our contractual agreements with fnma authorize fnma to require us to post additional collateral to secure our recourse obligations with fnma  and fnma has the contractual right to request collateral for the full amount of our recourse obligations when  as now  we do not maintain an investment grade rating 
in january  we agreed to post with fnma million in collateral to secure our recourse obligations 
in addition  certain of our servicing agreements  such as those with fnma  fhlmc  and gnma  contain provisions triggered by changes in our financial condition or failure to maintain required credit ratings 
we do not currently maintain the credit ratings required by gnma and possibly other counterparties  which may result in increased collateral requirements and or require us to engage a substitute fund custodian  or could result in termination of our servicing rights 
termination of our servicing rights  requirements to post additional collateral or the loss of custodian funds could reduce our liquidity and have an adverse impact on our operating results 
our ability to sell loans and other mortgage products to government sponsored entities could be impacted by changes in our financial condition or the historical performance of our mortgage products 
our ability to sell mortgage products to government sponsored entities gses  such as fnma  fhlmc and gnma  depends  among other things  on our financial condition and the historical performance of our mortgage products 
to protect our ability to continue to sell mortgage products to gnma and other gses  we have and may in the future repurchase defaulted loans from such counterparties 
during and 
table of contents  we repurchased million and million  respectively  of defaulted fha guaranteed loans from gnma 
any such repurchases in the future may negatively impact our liquidity and operating results 
termination of our ability to sell mortgage products to the gses would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we may engage in fdic assisted transactions  which could present additional risks to our business 
we may have opportunities to acquire the assets and liabilities of failed banks in fdic assisted transactions 
although these transactions typically provide for fdic assistance to an acquirer to mitigate certain risks  such as sharing exposure to loan losses and providing indemnification against certain liabilities of the failed institution  we would still be subject to many of the same risks we would face in acquiring another bank in a negotiated transaction  including risks associated with maintaining customer relationships and failure to realize the anticipated acquisition benefits in the amounts and within the timeframes we expect 
in addition  because these transactions are structured in a manner that would not allow us the time and access to information normally associated with preparing for and evaluating a negotiated transaction  we may face additional risk in fdic assisted transactions  including additional strain on management resources  management of problem loans  problems related to integration of personnel and operating systems and impact to our capital resources requiring us to raise additional capital 
we may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with fdic assisted transactions 
our inability to overcome these risks could have a material effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may fail to retain and attract key employees and management personnel 
our success has been and will continue to be influenced by our ability to retain and attract key employees and management personnel  including senior and middle management 
our ability to attract and retain key employees and management personnel may be adversely affected as a result of the workload and stress associated with the resolution of legacy issues and business transformation efforts  and related risks and uncertainties  the consolidation of the puerto rico banking industry  or by additional work relating to any potential or actual acquisition 
competition with other financial institutions could adversely affect the profitability of our operations 
the company faces significant competition from other financial institutions  many of which have significantly greater assets  capital and other resources 
as a result  many of the company s competitors have advantages in conducting certain businesses and providing certain services 
this competitive environment could force the company to increase the rates it offers on deposits or lower the rates it charges on loans and  consequently  could adversely affect the profitability of its operations 
damage to our reputation could damage our businesses 
maintaining a positive reputation for the company is critical to the company attracting and maintaining customers  investors and employees 
damage to its reputation can therefore cause significant harm to the company s business and prospects 
harm to the company s reputation can arise from numerous sources  including  among others  employee misconduct  litigation or regulatory outcomes  failing to deliver minimum standards of service and quality  compliance failures  unethical behavior  and the activities of customers and counterparties 
negative publicity regarding the company  whether or not true  may also result in harm to the company s prospects 
we must respond to rapid technological changes  and these changes may be more difficult or expensive than anticipated 
if competitors introduce new products and services embodying new technologies  or if new industry standards and practices emerge  our existing product and service offerings  technology and systems may become obsolete 
further  if we fail to adopt or develop new technologies or to adapt our products and services to emerging industry standards  we may lose current and future customers  which could have a 
table of contents material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the financial services industry is changing rapidly and in order to remain competitive  we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our products  services and technologies 
these changes may be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate 
doral financial and its banking subsidiaries are subject to the supervision and regulation of various banking regulators and have entered into consent orders with these regulators  and these regulators could take action against the company or its banking subsidiaries 
as a regulated financial services firm  the company s good standing with its regulators is of fundamental importance to the continuation and growth of its businesses 
doral financial is subject to supervision and regulation by the federal reserve and the office of the commissioner  doral bank pr is subject to supervision and regulation by the fdic and the office of the commissioner and doral bank us is subject to supervision and regulation by the ots and the fdic 
federal banking regulators  in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties  have significant discretion and power to initiate enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices 
the enforcement powers available to federal banking regulators include  among others  the ability to assess civil monetary penalties  to issue cease and desist or removal orders  to require written agreements and to initiate injunctive actions 
doral financial and doral bank pr have entered into consent orders with the federal reserve  the fdic and the office of the commissioner  which  among other things  prohibited the company s banking subsidiaries from paying dividends to the parent company  and prohibited doral financial from paying dividends to its common and preferred shareholders  without regulatory approval and required doral bank pr to take various actions to ensure compliance with the provisions of the bank secrecy act 
while the fdic and the office of the commissioner have lifted their consent orders  these banking regulators could take further action with respect to doral financial or our banking subsidiaries and  if any such further action were taken  such action could have a material adverse effect on doral financial 
doral financial s consent order with the federal reserve is still in effect and the company s banking regulators could take additional actions to protect the company s banking subsidiaries or to ensure that the holding company remains as a source of financial and managerial strength to its banking subsidiaries  and such action could have adverse effects on the company or its stockholders 
doral financial has been the subject of an investigation by the us attorney s office for the southern district of new york  which could require it to pay substantial fines or penalties 
on august   doral financial received a grand jury subpoena from the us attorney s office for the southern district of new york regarding the production of certain documents  including financial statements and corporate  auditing and accounting records prepared during the period relating to the restatement of doral financial s financial statements 
doral financial cannot predict when this investigation will be completed or what the results of this investigation will be 
the effects and results of this investigation could have a material adverse effect on doral financial s business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
adverse developments related to this investigation  including any expansion of its scope  could negatively impact the company and could divert efforts and attention of its management team from doral financial s ordinary business operations 
doral financial may be required to pay material fines  judgments or settlements or suffer other penalties  each of which could have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
this investigation could adversely affect doral financial s ability to obtain  and or increase the cost of obtaining  directors and officers liability insurance and or other types of insurance  which could have a material adverse effect on doral financial s businesses  results of operations and financial condition 
doral financial may be required to advance significant amounts to cover the reasonable legal and other expenses of its former officers and directors 
under doral financial s by laws  doral financial is obligated to pay in advance the reasonable expenses incurred by former officers and directors in defending civil or criminal actions or proceedings pending final 
table of contents disposition of such actions 
since  doral financial has been advancing funds on behalf of various former officers and directors in connection with the grand jury proceeding referred to above and ongoing investigations by the sec relating to the restatement of doral financial s financial statements 
on march   a former treasurer of doral financial was indicted for alleged criminal violations involving securities and wire fraud 
on april   the former treasurer of doral was convicted on three of the five counts of securities and wire fraud he was facing after a five week jury trial 
on august   the former treasurer of doral filed a complaint against the company in the supreme court of the state of new york 
the complaint alleges that the company breached a contract with the plaintiff and the company s by laws by failing to advance payment of certain legal fees and expenses that mr 
levis has incurred in connection with a criminal indictment filed against him in the us district court for the southern district of new york 
further  the complaint claims that doral financial fraudulently induced the plaintiff to enter into agreements concerning the settlement of a civil litigation arising from the restatement of the company s financial statements for fiscal years through the complaint seeks declaratory relief  damages  costs and expenses 
the former treasurer further moved for preliminary injunctive relief 
on december   the parties entered into a settlement agreement 
on december   the former treasurer s motion for a preliminary injunction was denied as moot  and all further proceedings were stayed  but the procedures for future disputes between the parties and outlined in the settlement agreement were not affected by the stay 
the amounts required to be advanced in an appeal of the criminal conviction could be substantial and could materially adversely affect doral financial s results of operations 
our businesses may be adversely affected by litigation 
from time to time  our customers  or the government on their behalf  may make claims and take legal action relating to our performance of fiduciary or contractual responsibilities 
we may also face employment lawsuits or other legal claims 
in any such claims or actions  demands for substantial monetary damages may be asserted against us resulting in financial liability or an adverse effect on our reputation among investors or on customer demand for our products and services 
we may be unable to accurately estimate our exposure to litigation risk when we record balance sheet reserves for probable loss contingencies 
as a result  any reserves we establish to cover any settlements or judgments may not be sufficient to cover our actual financial exposure  which may have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
in the ordinary course of our business  we are also subject to various regulatory  governmental and law enforcement inquiries  investigations and subpoenas 
these may be directed generally to participants in the businesses in which we are involved or may be specifically directed at us 
in regulatory enforcement matters  claims for disgorgement  the imposition of penalties and the imposition of other remedial sanctions are possible 
risks related to our common stock additional issuances of common stock or securities convertible into common stock may further dilute existing holders of our common stock 
we may determine that it is advisable  or we may encounter circumstances where we determine it is necessary  to issue additional shares of our common stock  securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our common stock  or common equivalent securities to fund strategic initiatives or other business needs or to raise additional capital 
depending on our capital needs  we may make such a determination in the near future or in subsequent periods 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of any such future offering  as well as other sales of a large block of shares of our common stock or similar securities in the market thereafter  or the perception that such sales could occur 
in addition  such additional equity issuances would reduce any earnings available to the holders of our common stock and the return thereon unless our earnings increase correspondingly 
we cannot predict the timing or size of future equity issuances  if any  or the effect that they may have on the market price of the 
table of contents common stock 
the issuance of substantial amounts of equity  or the perception that such issuances may occur  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
dividends on our common stock have been suspended  doral financial may not be able to pay dividends on its common stock in the future 
holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments 
on april   we announced that  as a prudent capital management decision designed to preserve and strengthen the company s capital  our board of directors had suspended the quarterly dividend on common stock 
in addition  we will be unable to pay dividends on our common stock unless and until we resume payments of dividends on our preferred stock  which were suspended by the board of directors in march the company s ability to pay dividends in the future is limited by various regulatory requirements and policies of bank regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the company and such other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
under an existing consent order with the federal reserve  we are restricted from paying dividends on our capital stock without the prior written approval of the federal reserve 
we are required to request permission for the payment of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock not less than days prior to a proposed dividend declaration date 
we may not receive approval for the payment of such dividends in the future or  even with such approval  our board of directors may not resume payment of dividends 
the price of our common stock may be subject to fluctuations and volatility 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations because of factors specifically related to our businesses and general market conditions 
factors that could cause such fluctuations  many of which could be beyond our control  include the following changes or perceived changes in the condition  operations  results or prospects of our businesses and market assessments of these changes or perceived changes  announcements of strategic developments  acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors  changes in governmental regulations or proposals  or new government regulations or proposals  affecting us  including those relating to general market or economic conditions and those that may be specifically directed to us  the continued decline  failure to stabilize or lack of improvement in general market and economic conditions in our principal markets  the departure of key personnel  changes in the credit  mortgage and real estate markets  operating results that vary from expectations of management  securities analysts and investors  operating and stock price performance of companies that investors deem comparable to us  changes in financial reports by securities analysts  developments related to investigations  proceedings  or litigation that involves us  and the occurrence of major catastrophic events  including terrorist attacks 
all of our debt obligations and our preferred stock will have priority over our common stock with respect to payment in the event of a liquidation  dissolution or winding up 
in any liquidation  dissolution or winding up of doral financial  our common stock would rank below all debt claims against us and all of our outstanding shares of preferred stock 
as a result  holders of our common 
table of contents stock will not be entitled to receive any payment or other distribution of assets upon the liquidation or dissolution until after our obligations to our debt holders and holders of preferred stock have been satisfied 
our certificate of incorporation  our by laws and certain banking law provisions contain provisions that could discourage an acquisition or change of control of the company 
certain provisions under puerto rico and federal banking laws and regulations  together with certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws  may make it more difficult to effect a change in control of our company  to acquire us or to replace incumbent management 
these provisions could potentially deprive our stockholders of opportunities to sell shares of our common stock at above market prices 
our suspension of preferred stock dividends could result in the expansion of our board of directors 
on march   our board of directors announced that it had suspended the declaration and payment of all dividends on all outstanding series of our convertible preferred stock and our noncumulative preferred stock 
the suspension of dividends for our noncumulative preferred stock was effective and commenced with the dividends for the month of april the suspension of dividends for our convertible preferred stock was effective and commenced with the dividends for the quarter commencing in april since we have not paid dividends in full on our noncumulative preferred stock for at least eighteen consecutive monthly periods  or paid dividends in full on our convertible preferred stock for consecutive dividend periods containing in the aggregate a number of days equivalent to at least six fiscal quarters  the holders of our preferred stock  all acting together as a single class  have the right to elect two additional members to our board of directors

note to doral financial s consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the most significant accounting policies followed by doral financial in the preparation of its financial statements 
the accounting policies that have a significant impact on doral financial s statements and that require the most judgment are set forth below 
fair value measurements the company uses fair value measurements to state certain assets and liabilities at fair value and to support fair value disclosures 
securities held for trading  securities available for sale  derivatives and servicing assets are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
additionally  from time to time  the company may be 
table of contents required to record other financial assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis  such as loans held for sale  loans receivable and certain other assets 
these nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of lower of cost or market accounting or write downs of individual assets 
the company discloses for interim and annual reporting periods the fair value of all financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value  whether recognized or not in the statement of financial condition 
fair value hierarchy the company categorized its financial instruments based on the priority of inputs to the valuation technique into a three level hierarchy described below level valuation is based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets 
level valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market  or are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data  by correlation or by other means 
level valuation is generated from model based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market 
these unobservable assumptions reflect the company s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
valuation techniques include use of option pricing models  discounted cash flow models and similar techniques 
determination of fair value the company bases fair values on the price that would be received upon sale of an asset  or paid to transfer a liability  in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
it is doral financial s intent to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements  in accordance with the fair value hierarchy 
fair value measurements for assets and liabilities where there is limited or no observable market data are based primarily upon the company s estimates  and are generally calculated based on current pricing policy  the economic and competitive environment  the characteristics of the asset or liability and other such factors 
therefore  the fair values represent management s estimates and may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset or liability 
additionally  there may be inherent weaknesses in any calculation technique  and changes in the underlying assumptions used  including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows  could significantly affect the results of current or future values 
the company relies on appraisals for valuation of collateral dependent impaired loans and other real estate owned 
an appraisal of value is obtained at the time the loan is originated 
new estimates of collateral value are obtained when a loan that has been performing becomes delinquent and is determined to be collateral dependent  and at the time an asset is acquired through foreclosure 
updated reappraisals are requested at least every two years for collateral dependent loans and other real estate owned 
residential mortgage loans are considered collateral dependent when they are days past due collateral dependent residential mortgage loans are those past due loans whose borrowers financial condition has deteriorated to the point that doral considers only the collateral when determining its allowance for loan loss estimate 
an updated estimate of the property s value is obtained when the loan in days past due  and a second assessment of value is obtained when the loan is days past due 
the company generally uses broker price opinions bpos as an assessment of value of collateral dependent residential mortgage loans 
as it takes a period of time for commercial loan appraisals to be completed once they are ordered  doral must at times estimate its allowance for loan and lease losses for an impaired loan using a dated  or stale  appraisal 
as puerto rico has experienced some decrease in property values during its extended recession  the reported values of the stale appraisals must be adjusted to recognize the fade in market value 
in order to 
table of contents estimate the value of collateral with stale appraisals  doral has developed separate collateral price indices for small commercial loans and large commercial loans that are used to measure the market value fade in appraisals completed in one year to the current year 
the indices provide a measure of how much the property value has changed from the year in which the most recent appraisal was received to the current year 
in estimating its allowance for loan and lease losses on collateral dependent loans using outdated appraisals  doral uses the original appraisal as adjusted for the estimated fade in property value less selling costs to estimate the current fair value of the collateral 
that current adjusted estimated fair value is then compared to the reported investment  and if the adjusted fair value is less than reported investment  that amount is included in the allowance for loan and lease loss estimate 
residential development construction loans that are collateral dependent present unique challenges to estimating the fair value of the underlying collateral 
residential development construction loans are partially completed with additional construction costs to be incurred  have units being sold and released from the construction loan  and may have additional land collateralizing the loan on which the developer hopes or expects to build additional units 
therefore  the value of the collateral is regularly changing and any appraisal has a limited useful life 
doral uses an internally developed estimate of value that considers doral s exit strategy of foreclosing and completing the construction started and selling the individual units constructed for residential buildings  and separately uses the most recent appraised value for any remnant land adjusted for the fade in value since the appraisal date as described above 
this internally developed estimate is prepared in conjunction with a third party servicer of the portfolio who validates and determines the inputs used to arrive at the estimate of value eg units sold  expected sales  cost to complete  etc 
once third party appraisals are obtained the previously estimated property values are updated with the actual values reflected in the appraisal and any additional loss incurred is recognized in the period when the appraisal is received 
the internally developed collateral price index is also updated and any changes resulting from the update in the index are also recognized in the period 
refer to note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities  the valuation methodologies used and its impact on earnings 
gain or loss on mortgage loan sales the company generally sells or securitizes a portion of the residential mortgage loans that it originates 
fha and va loans are generally securitized into gnma mortgage backed securities and held as trading securities 
after holding these securities for a period of time  usually less than one month  doral financial sells these securities for cash through broker dealers 
conforming conventional loans are generally sold directly to fnma  fhlmc or institutional investors or exchanged for fnma or fhlmc issued mortgage backed securities  which doral financial also sells for cash through broker dealers 
as part of its mortgage loan sale and securitization activities  doral financial generally retains the right to service the mortgage loans it sells 
doral financial determines the gain on sale of a mortgage backed security or loan pool by allocating the carrying value  also known as basis  of the underlying mortgage loans between the mortgage backed security or mortgage loan pool sold and its retained interests  based on their relative estimated fair values 
the gain on sale reported by doral financial is the difference between the proceeds received from the sale and the cost allocated to the loans sold 
the proceeds include cash and other assets received in the transaction primarily msrs less any liabilities incurred ie  representations and warranty provisions 
the reported gain or loss is the difference between the proceeds from the sale of the security or mortgage loan pool and its allocated cost 
the amount of gain on sale is therefore influenced by the values of the msrs and retained interest recorded at the time of sale 
see retained interest valuation below for additional information 
if in a transfer of financial assets in exchange for cash or other consideration other than beneficial interests in transferred assets  doral financial has not surrendered control over the transferred assets  doral financial accounts for the transfer as a secured borrowing loan payable with a pledge of collateral 

table of contents retained interest valuation the company routinely originates  securitizes and sells mortgage loans into the secondary market 
the company generally retains the servicing rights and  in the past  also retained ios 
msrs represent the estimated present value of the normal servicing fees net of related servicing costs expected to be received on a loan being serviced over the expected term of the loan 
msrs entitle doral financial to a future stream of cash flows based on the outstanding principal balance of the loans serviced and the contractual servicing fee 
the annual servicing fees generally range between and basis points  less  in certain cases  any corresponding guarantee fee 
in addition  msrs may entitle doral financial  depending on the contract language  to ancillary income including late charges  float income  and prepayment penalties net of the appropriate expenses incurred for performing the servicing functions 
in certain instances  the company also services loans with no contractual servicing fee 
the servicing asset or liability associated with such loans is evaluated based on ancillary income  including float  late fees  prepayment penalties and costs 
the company s interests that continue to be held retained interest are subject to prepayment and interest rate risk 
msrs are classified as servicing assets in doral financial s consolidated statements of financial condition 
any servicing liability recognized is included as part of accrued expenses and other liabilities in doral financial s consolidated statements of financial condition 
the fair value of the company s msrs is determined based on a combination of market information on trading activity servicing trades and broker valuations  benchmarking of servicing assets valuation surveys and cash flow modeling 
the valuation of the company s msrs incorporate two sets of assumptions i market derived assumptions for discount rates  servicing costs  escrow earnings rate  float earnings rate and cost of funds and ii market derived assumptions adjusted for the company s loan characteristics and portfolio behavior for escrow balances  delinquencies and foreclosures  late fees  prepayments and prepayment penalties 
for the year ended december   the fair value of the msrs amounted to million  which represents a value decline of million compared to december  ios represent the estimated present value of cash flows retained by the company that are generated by the underlying fixed rate mortgages as adjusted for prepayments after subtracting i the interest rate payable to the investor adjusted for any embedded cap  if applicable  and ii a contractual servicing fee 
as of december   the carrying value of the ios of million is related to million of outstanding principal balance of mortgage loans sold to investors 
ios are classified as securities held for trading in doral financial s consolidated statements of financial condition 
to determine the value of its portfolio of variable ios  doral financial uses an internal valuation model that forecasts expected cash flows using forward libor rates derived from the libor swap yield curve at the date of the valuation 
the characteristics of the variable ios result in an increase in cash flows when libor rates fall and a reduction in cash flows when libor rates rise 
this provides a mitigating effect on the impact of prepayment speeds on the cash flows  with prepayments expected to rise when long term interest rates fall reducing the amount of expected cash flows and the opposite when long term interest rise 
prepayment assumptions incorporated into the valuation model for variable and fixed ios are based on publicly available  independently verifiable  prepayment assumptions for fnma mortgage pools and statistically derived prepayment adjusters based on observed relationships between the company s and fnma s us mainland mortgage pool prepayment experiences 
this methodology resulted in a cpr of for  for and for the change in the cpr between and was due mostly to reflect changes in experienced prepayments speeds 
the company continues to benchmark its assumptions for setting its liquidity credit risk premium to a third party valuation provider 
this methodology resulted in a discount rate that was used for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for ios  doral financial recognizes as interest income through the life of the io the excess of all estimated cash flows attributable to these interests over their recorded balance using the effective yield method 
the company updates its estimates of expected cash flows periodically and recognizes changes in calculated effective yield on a prospective basis 

table of contents valuation of trading securities and derivatives doral financial s net gain loss on trading activities includes gains and losses  whether realized or unrealized  on securities accounted for as held for trading  including ios  as well as various other financial instruments  such as derivative contracts  that doral financial uses to manage its interest rate risk 
securities held for trading and derivatives are recorded at fair values with increases or decreases in such values reflected in current earnings 
the fair values of many of doral financial s trading securities other than ios are based on market prices obtained from market data sources 
for instruments not traded on a recognized market  doral financial generally determines fair value by reference to quoted market prices for similar instruments 
the fair values of derivative instruments are obtained using internal valuation models based on financial modeling tools and using market derived assumptions obtained from market data sources 
until the second quarter of  securities accounted as held for trading included us treasury security positions  taken as economic hedges against the valuation adjustment of the company s capitalized mortgage servicing rights 
subsequently  the us treasury positions were unwound and other derivative instruments were used as economic hedges on the msr 
generally  derivatives are financial instruments with little or no initial net investment in comparison to their notional amount and whose value is based on the value of an underlying asset  index  reference rate or other variable 
they may be standardized contracts executed through organized exchanges or privately negotiated contractual agreements that can be customized to meet specific needs  including certain commitments to purchase and sell mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
the fair value of derivatives is generally reported net by counterparty  provided that a legally enforceable master agreement exists 
derivatives in a net asset position are reported as part of securities held for trading  at fair value 
similarly  derivatives in a net liability position are reported as part of accrued expenses and other liabilities  at fair value 
for those derivatives not designated as an accounting hedge  fair value gains and losses are reported as part of net gain loss on trading activities in the consolidated statements of operations 
other than temporary impairment the company performs an assessment of otti whenever the fair value of an investment security is less than its amortized cost basis at the balance sheet date 
amortized cost basis includes adjustments made to the cost of a security for accretion  amortization  collection of cash  previous otti recognized into earnings less any cumulative effect adjustments and fair value hedge accounting adjustments 
otti is considered to have occurred under the following circumstances if the company intends to sell the investment security and its fair value is less than its amortized cost 
if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that the company will decide or be required to sell the investment security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis 
if the company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the investment security 
this occurs when the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security 
in determining whether a credit loss exists  the company uses its best estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the investment security 
cash flows expected to be collected are estimated based on a careful assessment of all available information 
the amount of estimated credit loss is determined as the amount by which the amortized cost basis exceeds the present value of expected cash flows 
the company evaluates its individual available for sale investment securities for otti on at least a quarterly basis 
as part of this process  the company considers its intent to sell each investment security and whether it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery 
if either of these conditions is met  the company recognizes an otti charge to earnings equal to the entire difference between the security s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
for securities that meet neither of these conditions  an analysis is performed to determine if any of these securities are at risk for otti 
to determine which securities are at risk for otti and should be quantitatively evaluated 
table of contents utilizing a detailed cash flow analysis  the company evaluates certain indicators which consider various characteristics of each security including  but not limited to  the following the credit rating and related outlook or status of the securities  the creditworthiness of the issuers of the securities  the value and type of underlying collateral  the duration and level of the unrealized loss  any credit enhancements  and other collateral related characteristics such as the ratio of credit enhancements to expected credit losses 
the relative importance of this information varies based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each security  as well as the economic environment at the time of assessment 
the amount of estimated credit loss is determined as the amount by which the amortized cost basis exceeds the present value of expected cash flows 
other income recognition policies interest income on loans is accrued by doral financial when earned 
loans are placed on non accrual status when any portion of principal or interest is more than days past due  except for revolving lines of credit and credit cards that are still accruing until days past due and fha and va loans that are still accruing until days past due  or earlier if concern exists as to the ultimate collectability of principal or interest 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  all accrued but unpaid interest to date is reversed against interest income and the loan is accounted for on the cash or cost recovery method  until it qualifies for return to accrual status 
loans return to accrual status when principal and interest become current under the terms of the loan agreement or when the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection and collectability is no longer doubtful 
loan origination fees  as well as discount points and certain direct origination costs for loans held for sale  are deferred at origination of the loan and are recognized in non interest income when the loan is sold or securitized into a mortgage backed security 
in the case of loans held for investment  such fees and costs are deferred and amortized to income as adjustments to the yield of the loan 
allowance for loan and lease losses doral financial maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses to absorb probable credit related losses on its loans receivable portfolio 
the allowance consists of specific and general components and is based on doral financial s assessment of default probabilities  internal risk ratings based on borrowers financial stability  external credit ratings  management strength  earnings and operating environment  probable loss and recovery rates  and the degree of risk inherent in the loans receivable portfolio 
the allowance is maintained at a level that doral financial considers to be adequate to absorb probable losses 
credit losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the allowance  while increases to the allowance are charged to operations 
unanticipated increases in the allowance for loan and lease losses could adversely impact doral financial s net income in the future 
doral estimates and records its alll on a monthly basis 
for all performing loans and non performing small balance homogeneous loans the alll is estimated based upon estimated probability of default and loss given default by shared product characteristics using doral financial s historical experience 
for larger construction  commercial real estate  commercial and industrial loans and tdrs that are or more days past due or are otherwise considered to be impaired  management estimates the related alll based upon an analysis of each individual loans characteristics 
the alll estimate methodologies are described more fully in the following paragraphs 
residential mortgage 
the general allowance for residential mortgage loans is calculated based on the probability that loans within different delinquency buckets will default and  in the case of default  the extent of losses that the company expects to realize 
in determining the probabilities of default  the company considers recent experience of rolls of loans from one delinquency bucket into the next 
roll rates as of year end show that the proportion of loans rolling into subsequent buckets has remained constant 
in determining the allowance for loan and lease losses for residential mortgage loans  given the current economic trends in puerto rico  for purposes of forecasting the future behavior of the portfolio  doral financial determined that it should only use the roll rates of relatively recent months  which show a more aggressive deteriorating trend than those in older periods 
using the older historical performance would yield lower probabilities of default that may not 
table of contents reflect recent macroeconomic trends 
severity of loss is calculated based on historical results from foreclosure and ultimate disposition of collateral 
historical results are adjusted for the company s expectation of housing prices 
severity assumptions for the residential portfolio range between and depending on the different loan types and loan to value ratios  and up to for second mortgages 
construction and land  commercial real estate and commercial and industrial 
the alll for performing construction and land  commercial real estate and commercial and industrial is estimated considering either the probability of the loan defaulting in the next twelve months and the estimated loss incurred in the event of default or the loan quality assigned to each loan and the estimated expected loss associated with that loan grade 
the probability of a loan defaulting is based upon doral financial s experience with its current portfolio 
the loss grade is assigned based upon management s review of the specific facts and circumstances associated with a particular credit 
the loss incurred upon default is based upon doral s actual experience in resolving defaulted loans 
construction and land  commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans with principal balances greater than million that are not performing  or when management estimates it may not collect all contractual principal and interest  are considered impaired and are measured for impairment individually 
loans are considered impaired when  based on current information and events it is probable that the borrower will not be able to fulfill its obligation according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
due to the current economic environment and management s perceived increase in risk in the commercial loan portfolio  during the third quarter of management individually reviewed for impairment all commercial loans over  that were over days past due to better estimate the amount the company expects to receive 
during the fourth quarter of  management individually reviewed all commercial real estate loans over  that were over days past due  of all commercial loans between  and  and over days past due  as well as all new loans classified as substandard during the quarter 
in future periods  and while management s assessment of the inherent credit risk in the commercial portfolio continues to be high  the company will continue to evaluate on a quarterly basis of all commercial loans over days past due and between  and  so that in any one year period it would have individually evaluated for impairment of all substandard commercial loans between  and  as well as all substandard commercial real estate loans over  and all substandard commercial and construction loans over million 
the impairment loss  if any  on each individual loan identified as impaired is generally measured based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
as a practical expedient  impairment may be measured based on the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral  net of disposition costs  if the loan is collateral dependent 
if foreclosure is probable  accounting guidance requires the measurement of impairment to be based on the fair value of the collateral  net of disposition costs 
since current appraisals were not available on all properties at quarter end  management determined its loss reserve estimates for these loans by estimating the fair value of the collateral 
in doing so  management considered a number of factors including the general change in price levels as indicated by appraisals received compared to earlier appraisals of the same property  the price at which individual units could be sold in the current market  the period of time over which the units would be sold  the estimated cost to complete the units  the risks associated with completing and selling the units  the required rate of return on investment a potential acquirer may have and current market interest rates in the puerto rico market 
consumer 
the alll for consumer loans is estimated based upon the historical charge off rate using doral financial s historical experience 
the alll is supplemented by doral s policy to charge off all amounts in excess of the collateral value when the loan principal or interest is days or more days past due 
tdrs 
in accordance with accounting guidance  loans determined to be tdrs are impaired and for purposes of estimating the alll must be individually evaluated for impairment 
for residential mortgage loans determined to be tdrs  on a monthly basis  the company pools tdrs with similar characteristics and performs an impairment analysis of discounted cash flows 
if a pool yields a present value below the recorded investment in the pool of loans  an impairment is recognized by a charge to the provision for loan and lease losses and a credit to the allowance for loan and lease losses 
for loss mitigated loans without a concession in 
table of contents the interest rate  the company performs an impairment analysis of discounted cash flows giving consideration to the probability of default and loss given foreclosure on those estimated cash flows  and records an impairment by charging the provision for loan and lease losses with a corresponding credit to the alll 
generally  the percentage of the allowance for loan and lease losses to non performing loans will not remain constant due to the nature of doral financial s loan portfolios  which are primarily collateralized by real estate 
the collateral for each non performing mortgage loan is analyzed to determine potential loss exposure  and  in conjunction with other factors  this loss exposure contributes to the overall assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
on an ongoing basis  management monitors the loan portfolio and evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance  management considers such factors as default probabilities  internal risk ratings based on borrowers financial stability  external credit ratings  management strength  earnings and operating environment  probable loss and recovery rates  and the degree of risk inherent in the loan portfolios 
allocated general reserves are supplemented by a macroeconomic or emerging risk reserve 
this portion of the total allowance for loan and lease losses reflects management s evaluation of conditions that are not directly reflected in the loss factors used in the determination of the allowance 
the conditions evaluated in connection with the macroeconomic and emerging risk allowance include national and local economic trends  industry conditions within the portfolios  recent loan portfolio performance  loan growth  changes in underwriting criteria and the regulatory and public policy environment 
loans considered by management to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance for loan and lease losses 
recoveries on loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
provisions for loan and lease losses are charged to expenses and credited to the allowance in amounts deemed appropriate by management based upon its evaluation of the known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
the company also engages in the restructuring and or modifications of the debt of borrowers  who are delinquent due to economic or legal reasons  if the company determines that it is in the best interest for both the company and the borrower to do so 
in some cases  due to the nature of the borrower s financial condition  the restructure or loan modification fits the definition of troubled debt restructuring tdr 
such restructures are identified as tdrs and accounted for as impaired loans 
estimated recourse obligation in the past  the company sold mortgage loans and mbs subject to recourse provisions 
pursuant to these recourse arrangements  the company agreed to retain or share the credit risk with the purchaser of such mortgage loans for a specified period or up to a certain percentage of the total amount in loans sold 
the company estimates the fair value of the retained recourse obligation or any liability incurred at the time of sale and includes such obligation with the net proceeds from the sale  resulting in a lower gain on sale recognition 
doral estimates the fair value of its recourse obligation based on historical losses from foreclosure and disposition of mortgage loans adjusted for expectations of changes in portfolio behavior and market environment 
income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities based on current tax laws 
to the extent tax laws change  deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted  as necessary  in the period that the tax change is enacted 
the company recognizes income tax benefits when the realization of such benefits is probable 
a valuation allowance is recognized for any deferred tax asset which  based on management s evaluation  it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and  in particular  any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  the company considers the expected reversal of its deferred tax assets and liabilities  projected future taxable income  cumulative losses in recent years and tax planning strategies 
the determination of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets requires judgment based on 
table of contents weight of all available evidence and considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
these estimates are projected through the life of the related deferred tax assets based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and consistent with current operating results 
changes in future operating results not currently forecasted may have a significant impact on the realization of deferred tax assets 
the company classifies all interest and penalties related to tax uncertainties as income tax expense 
income tax benefit or expense includes i deferred tax expense or benefit  which represents the net change in the deferred tax assets or liability balance during the year plus any change in the valuation allowance  if any  and ii current tax expense 
results of operations for the years ended december   and net interest income net interest income is the excess of interest earned by doral financial on its interest earning assets over the interest incurred on its interest bearing liabilities 
doral financial s net interest income is subject to interest rate risk due to the repricing and maturity mismatch in the company s assets and liabilities 
generally  doral financial s assets have a longer maturity and a later repricing date than its liabilities  which results in lower net interest income in periods of rising short term interest rates and higher net interest income in periods of declining short term interest rates 
refer to risk management below for additional information on the company s exposure to interest rate risk

significant variances impacting interest income for the year ended december   when compared to the corresponding period  are as follows a reduction of million in interest income on loans primarily related to the lower interest rate environment and an increase in non performing loans in the company s loan portfolio 
the average interest rate on loans decreased basis points for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  while non performing loans increased by million during an increase of million in interest income on mortgage backed securities resulted from the net effect and timing of the sale of approximately billion of securities and the purchase of approximately billion of securities during the year for the purpose of increasing interest margin in the first six months and reducing the company s interest rate exposure in the latter part of the year 
these transactions resulted in an increase in the average balance of mortgage backed securities of million 

table of contents a decrease of million in interest income on ios was mainly driven by a decrease of million in the average balance of ios during due to the portfolio run off

a reduction of million in the average balance of deposits during  combined with the decrease in the interest expense thereon resulted in a decrease in the average cost of deposits during of basis points compared to the corresponding period 
a decrease of million in the interest expense on securities sold under agreements to repurchase was mainly driven by the general decline in interest rates that resulted in a reduction of basis points in the average interest cost during a reduction of million in interest expense on advances from fhlb resulted primarily from the general decline in interest rates that allowed the company s to maintain its balance of advances at lower fixed rates 
while the average balance of advances from fhlb decreased million during  the average cost decreased by basis points for the year ended december  an increase of million in interest expense on other short term borrowings is directly related to the increase of billion in the average balance of other short term borrowings for the year ended december   when compared to corresponding period

provision for loan and lease losses the provision for loan and lease losses is charged to earnings to bring the total allowance for loan and lease losses to a level considered appropriate by management considering all losses inherent in the portfolio and based on doral financial s historical loss experience  current delinquency rates  known and inherent risks 
table of contents in the loan portfolio  individual assessment of significant impaired loans  the estimated value of the underlying collateral or discounted expected cash flows  and an assessment of current economic conditions and emerging risks 
while management believes that the current allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate  future additions to the allowance could be necessary if economic conditions change or if credit losses increase substantially from those estimated by doral financial in determining the allowance 
unanticipated increases in the allowance for loan and lease losses could materially affect doral financial s net income in future periods 
compared to doral financial s provision for loan and lease losses for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to million compared to million for the higher provision for loan and lease losses in was driven by increases in the provision for residential  commercial real estate and construction and land portfolios 
please refer to the discussions under credit risk for further analysis of the allowance for loan and lease losses and non performing assets and related ratios 
the provision for loan and lease losses for the residential mortgage portfolio increased by million  or  from million for to million for the year ended december  the higher provision for residential mortgage loans was driven by the level of loan modifications considered tdrs and for which a temporary interest reduction was granted 
these tdrs are measured individually for impairment based on the discounted cash flow method 
the use of the discounted cash flow method resulted in higher levels of allowance when compared with the general reserve  depending on the level of concession granted 
net charge offs on residential mortgage loans increased due to the implementation at the beginning of of the company s real estate valuation policy under which the company obtains assessments of collateral value for residential mortgage loans over days past due and any outstanding balance in excess of the value of the property less cost to sell is classified as loss and written down by charging the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the increase in the provision for loan losses on residential mortgage loans was driven by i an increase of million due to tdrs individually evaluated for impairment  ii an increase of million related to the impact of net charge offs on the allowance  iii million due to transfers of foreclosed loans to oreo  and this was partially offset by million due to delinquency improvement 
the provision for loan and lease losses for the commercial real estate portfolio increased by million for the year ended december   when compared to the corresponding period due to i a million provision related to a reduction in the threshold for individually evaluated impaired loans from million to  ii an million provision due to the adverse classification of a participation interest in a current paying loan of million for which a charge off over allowance was recorded during the year  iii an million additional provision on loans individually measured for impairment  iv a million provision due to tdrs during the year which are individually evaluated for impairment  and v a million provision as loans rolled to delinquency 
the provision for loan and lease losses on the construction and land loan portfolio increased million during primarily due to the sale of a construction portfolio to a third party during the third quarter of that resulted in additional provisions of million  this was partially offset by the release of million in reserve as one project loan was worked out 
the provisions for the other consumer loan portfolio and the commercial and industrial loan portfolio reflected decreases of million and million  respectively in compared to the decrease in the provision for the consumer loan portfolio was due to lower delinquency and the runoff of the portfolio 
for commercial and industrial loans the reduction is also the result of reduction in the puerto rico portfolio 
the provision for loan and lease losses was also impacted by the effect of charge offs related to foreclosed loans  higher loss mitigation volume and an increase in severities in the determination of the provision due to strategic decision to accelerate oreo dispositions 
the provision for loan and lease losses was offset by net charge offs of million for the year ended december  which included million related to the sale of certain construction loans  million related to a classified participation interest as well as charge offs of previously reserved balances and the implementation of the company s real estate valuation policy 

table of contents the sector of the economy most affecting doral financial  directly and indirectly  is the sale of new home construction in puerto rico 
the market absorption on new construction homes continued at a low level in the slowdown in new construction has resulted in lost jobs  which has further increased mortgage and commercial loan delinquencies as the overall level of economic activity declines 
the company expects that absorption will continue to be at low levels due to the current economic environment although a significant improvement was detected during the last quarter of the year 
in september  the governor of puerto rico signed into law act 
no 
of  which established various housing  tax and other incentives to stimulate the sale of new and existing housing units 
the tax and other incentives  which include reductions relating to capital gains  property taxes and property recording fees and stamps  will be effective until june  compared to doral financial s provision for loan and lease losses for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to million for the corresponding period  an increase of million  or 
for  the provision for all portfolios increased except for the provision for the commercial real estate loan portfolio which is the portfolio where a higher provision was established at the end of the level of the provision in was largely driven by higher delinquencies primarily in the construction  residential mortgage and commercial loan portfolios during the period and continued deterioration in the puerto rico economy 
mortgage lending is the company s principal line of business and has historically reflected low levels of losses 
nevertheless  due to current economic conditions in puerto rico  which have resulted in higher non performing loans and loss severities in the residential mortgage loan portfolio  the company increased its allowance and provision for loan and lease losses for this portfolio during perhaps the sector of the economy most affecting doral financial  directly and indirectly  is the sale of new home construction in puerto rico 
for the year ended december   the market absorption of new construction homes decreased significantly  principally due to the termination  late in the fourth quarter of  of the tax incentive for new and existing home purchases provided by law this circumstance required modifications in absorption estimates  resulting in higher loan loss provisions 
furthermore  the slowdown in new construction has resulted in lost jobs  which has further increased mortgage and commercial loan delinquencies as the overall level of economic activity declines 
the company expects that absorption will continue to be at low levels due to the current economic environment 
in optimizing its recovery of non performing construction loans  as of december   management decided to foreclose approximately non performing residential development properties with an outstanding balance of approximately million in order to accelerate sales of the individual units 
most of these projects were in a mature stage of the development with approximately complete or close to completion 
as foreclosure was probable  accounting guidance required the measurement of impairment to be based on the fair value of the collateral 
since current appraisals were not available on all these properties at year end  management determined its loss reserve estimates for these loans by estimating the fair value of the collateral 
in doing so  management considered a number of factors including the price at which individual units could be sold in the current market  the period of time over which the units would be sold  the estimated cost to complete the units  the risks associated with completing and selling the units  the required rate of return on investment a potential acquirer may have and current market interest rates in the puerto rico market 
management continues to evaluate the best course of action to optimize loan recoveries on all non performing properties  and will regularly assess all projects in choosing its course of action 
the provisions for loan and lease losses were partially offset by net charge offs of million  the net of which resulted in an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses of million for the year ended december  non interest loss income a summary of non interest loss income for the years ended december   and is provided below

income taxes the recognition of an income tax expense of million for the year ended december  resulted from a current tax expense of million and a deferred income tax expense of million 
the current income tax expense was related to us source income 
the deferred income tax expense was related 
table of contents to the recognition of additional deferred tax assets  primarily nols  net of amortization of existing dtas and net of an increase in the valuation allowance 
as of december   the company had two puerto rico entities which were in a cumulative loss position 
for purposes of assessing the realization of the dtas  the cumulative taxable loss position for these two entities is considered significant negative evidence that has caused management to conclude that the company will not be able to fully realize the deferred tax assets related to these two entities in the future 
accordingly  as of december  and  the company determined that it was more likely than not that million and million  respectively  of its gross deferred tax asset would not be realized and maintained a valuation allowance for those amounts 
for puerto rico taxable entities with positive core earnings  a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets was not recorded since they are expected to continue to be profitable 
at december   the net deferred tax asset associated with these two companies was million  compared to million at december  in addition  approximately million of the io tax asset would be realized through these entities 
in management s opinion  for these companies  the positive evidence of profitable core earnings outweighs any negative evidence 
the valuation allowance also includes million and million related to deferred taxes on unrealized losses on cash flow hedges as of december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   income tax benefit of million  resulted from a current tax benefit of million and a deferred tax benefit of million 
the current tax benefit is primarily related to the release of unrecognized tax benefits due to the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain tax positions net of the recognition of certain unrecognized tax benefits during the year 
this net benefit was partially offset by the recognition of tax expense related to intercompany transactions in the federal tax jurisdiction which had not been previously recognized net of current tax benefit related to the company s us affiliates 
the deferred tax benefit is primarily related to the effect of the company entering into an agreement with the puerto rico treasury department during the third quarter of amending the previous agreement regarding amortization of certain prepaid taxes  net of the amortization of existing deferred tax assets 
management does not establish a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets generated on the unrealized gains or losses of its securities available for sale because the company does not intend to sell the securities before recovery of value  and based on available evidence it is not more likely than not that the company will decide or be required to sell the securities before the recovery of its amortized cost basis 
management has therefore determined that a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets generated on the unrealized losses of its securities available for sale is not necessary at this time 
failure to achieve sufficient projected taxable income in the entities where a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets has not been established  might affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax asset 
on january   the governor signed into law the internal revenue code of code making the pr code ineffective  for the most part  for years commenced after december  under the provisions of the code  the maximum statutory corporate income tax rate is for years commenced after december  and ending before january   if the government meets its income generation and expense control goals  for years commenced after december   the maximum corporate tax rate will be 
the code  however  eliminated the special surtax on corporations for tax year in general  the code maintains the increase in carry forward periods for net operating losses generated between and from to years as provided for in act  maintains the concept of the alternative minimum tax although it changed the way it is computed  and specifies what types of auditors report will be acceptable when audited financial statements are required to be filed with the income tax return 
notwithstanding  a corporation may be subject to the provisions of the pr code if it so elects it by the time it files its income tax return for the first year commenced after december  and ending before january  once the election is made  it will be effective for such year and the next succeeding years

gnma programs allow financial institutions to buy back individual delinquent mortgage loans that meet certain criteria from the securitized loan pool for which the company provides servicing 
at the company s option and without gnma prior authorization  doral financial may repurchase such delinquent loans for an amount equal to of the loan s remaining principal balance 
this buy back option is considered a conditional option until the delinquency criteria are met  at which time the option becomes unconditional but not an obligation 
when the loans backing a gnma security are initially securitized  the company treats the transaction as a sale for accounting purposes and the loans are removed from the balance sheet because the conditional nature of the buy back option means that the company does not maintain effective control over the loans 
when individual loans later meet gnma s specified delinquency criteria and are eligible for repurchase  doral financial is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans 
in such case  for financial reporting purposes  the delinquent gnma loans are brought back into the company s portfolio of loans held for sale  regardless of whether the company intends to exercise the buy back option

table of contents give doral financial the right to declare a conventional mortgage loan immediately due and payable in the event  among other things  that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of mortgage loans tends to increase when current mortgage loan rates are higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and  conversely  decrease when current mortgage loan rates are lower than rates on existing mortgage loans 
under the latter circumstance  the weighted average yield on loans decreases as higher yielding loans are repaid or refinanced at lower rates

at december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of doral financial s gross loans receivable were adjustable rate loans 
the increase in the percentage of adjustable rate loans from to was due to the increase in the syndicated loan portfolio 
the adjustable rate construction and land and commercial loans have interest rate adjustment limitations and are generally tied to the prime rate  and often provide for a maximum and minimum rate beyond which the applicable interest rate will not fluctuate

at december   doral financial had unrealized gains in aoci of million  compared to unrealized losses of million at december  related to its available for sale portfolio 
the securities held by the company are principally mortgage backed securities or securities backed by a us government sponsored agencies and therefore  principal and interest on the securities are deemed recoverable 
doral financial s investment portfolio consists primarily of aaa rated debt securities  except for the non agency collateralized mortgage obligations cmo as well as a few other positions 
during  the company sold approximately billion of investment securities  and also purchased billion of shorter duration securities 
these actions are part of the execution of the company strategy to de lever and reposition the balance sheet 
for the year ended december   the company recognized losses on sale of investment securities of million as a result of the sale on certain non agency securities at a loss of million  offset by the sale of mortgage backed securities and other debt securities at a gain of million as part of doral s strategic balance sheet restructuring efforts 
the company performs an assessment of otti whenever the fair value of an investment security is less than its amortized cost basis at the balance sheet date 
amortized cost basis includes adjustments made to the cost of a security for accretion  amortization  collection of cash  previous otti recognized into earnings less any cumulative effect adjustments and fair value hedge accounting adjustments 
otti is considered to have occurred under the following circumstances if the company intends to sell the investment security and its fair value is less than its amortized cost 
if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that the company will decide or be required to sell the investment security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis 
if the company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the investment security 
this occurs when the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security 
in determining whether a credit loss exists  the company uses its best estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the investment security 
cash flows expected to be collected are estimated based on a careful assessment of all available information 
the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis represents the amount of credit loss 
the company evaluates its individual available for sale investment securities for otti on at least a quarterly basis 
as part of this process  the company considers its intent to sell each investment security and whether it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery 
if either of these conditions is met  the company recognizes an otti charge to earnings equal to the entire difference between the security s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
for securities that meet neither of these conditions  an analysis is performed to determine if any of these securities are at risk for otti 
to determine which securities are at risk for otti and should be quantitatively evaluated utilizing a detailed cash flow analysis  the company evaluates certain indicators which consider various characteristics of each security including  but not limited to  the following the credit rating and related outlook or status of the securities  the creditworthiness of the issuers of the securities  the value and type of underlying collateral  the duration and level of the unrealized loss  any credit enhancements  and other collateral related characteristics such as the ratio of credit enhancements to expected credit losses 
the relative importance of this information varies based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each security  as well as the economic environment at the time of assessment 
the negative difference between the estimate of the 
table of contents present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis is considered to be a credit loss 
as a result of its review of the portfolio as of december   the company performed a detailed cash flow analysis of certain securities in unrealized loss positions to assess whether they were otti 
the company uses a third party provider to generate cash flow forecasts of each security reviewed based on a combination of management and market driven assumptions and securitization terms  including remaining payment terms of the security  prepayment speeds  the estimated amount of loans to become seriously delinquent over the life of the security  the estimated life time severity rate  estimated losses over the life of the security  loan characteristics  the level of subordination within the security structure  expected housing price changes and interest rate assumptions 
during  it was determined that eight securities reflected otti 
the characteristics of these securities that led to the otti conclusion included i the cumulative level and estimated future delinquency levels  ii the effect of severely delinquent loans on forecasted defaults  iii the cumulative severity and expected severity in resolving the defaulted loans  and iv the current subordination of the securities that resulted in the present value of the forecast cash flows being less than the cost basis of the security 
management estimated that credit losses of million were incurred on these securities for the year ended december  five of the eight otti securities were subordinated interests in a securitization structure collateralized by option adjustable rate mortgage arm loans and resulted in the recognition of an otti loss of million in the first quarter of on april   the company sold the entire portfolio of us non agency cmos  including the five securities that were otti  and recognized a loss of million  of which million had previously been reflected in other comprehensive income loss 
non agency cmos include subordinated tranches of securitizations of doral originated mortgage loans primarily composed of and vintages 
doral purchased these cmos at a discounted price of of par value  anticipating a partial loss of principal and interest value 
these original three securities have an amortized cost of million as of december  including an otti loss of million due to credit 
higher default and loss assumptions driven by higher delinquencies in puerto rico  primarily due to the impact of inflationary pressures on the consumer  the high rate of unemployment and general recessionary condition on the island  has resulted in higher default and loss estimates on the pr non agency cmos 
the higher default and loss estimates have resulted in lower bond prices and higher levels of unrealized losses on the bonds 
it is possible that future loss assumptions could change and cause future otti charges in these securities 
as of december  and  the company did not intend to sell the remaining securities which were evaluated for otti and concluded it was not more likely than not that it would be required to sell these securities before the anticipated recovery of each security s remaining amortized cost basis 
therefore  the difference between the amortized cost basis and the market value of the securities is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
for the remainder of the company s securities portfolio that have experienced decreases in the fair value  the decline is considered to be temporary as the company expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis on the securities and neither intends to sell these securities nor is it more likely than not that it will be required to sell these securities 
in subsequent periods the company will account for the securities judged to be otti as if the securities had been purchased at the previous amortized cost less the credit related otti 
once a credit loss is recognized  the investment will be adjusted to a new amortized cost basis equal to the previous amortized cost basis less the amount recognized in earnings 
for the investment securities for which otti was recognized in earnings  the difference between the new amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected will be accreted as interest income

brokered deposits are used by doral financial s retail banking subsidiaries as a source of long term funds  and doral financial s retail banking subsidiaries have traditionally been able to replace maturing brokered deposits 
brokered deposits  however  are generally considered a less stable source of funding than core deposits obtained through retail bank branches 
brokered deposit investors are generally very sensitive to interest rates and will generally move funds from one depository institution to another based on minor differences in rates offered on deposits

doral financial also derives liquidity from the sale of mortgage loans in the secondary mortgage markets 
the us including puerto rico secondary mortgage market is the most liquid in the world in large part because of the sale or guarantee programs maintained by fha  va  hud  fnma and fhlmc 
to the extent these programs are curtailed or the standard for insuring or selling loans under such programs is materially increased  or  for any reason  doral financial were to fail to qualify for such programs  doral financial s ability to sell mortgage loans and consequently its liquidity would be materially adversely affected 
other uses of cash servicing agreements relating to the mbs programs of fnma  fhlmc and gnma  and to mortgage loans sold to certain other investors  require doral financial to advance funds to make scheduled payments of principal  interest  taxes and insurance  if such payments have not been received from the borrowers 
while doral financial generally recovers funds advanced pursuant to these arrangements within days  it must absorb the cost of funding the advances during the time the advance is outstanding 
for the year ended december   the monthly average amount of funds advanced by doral financial under such servicing agreements was approximately million  compared to million for the corresponding period of to the extent the mortgage loans underlying doral financial s servicing portfolio experience increased delinquencies  doral financial would be required to dedicate additional cash resources to comply with its obligation to advance funds as well as incur additional administrative costs related to increases in collection efforts 
in the past  doral financial sold pools of delinquent fha and va and conventional mortgage loans 
under these arrangements  doral financial is required to advance the scheduled payments whether or not collected from the underlying borrower 
while doral financial expects to recover the amounts advanced through foreclosure or  in the case of fha va loans  under the applicable fha and va insurance and guarantee programs  the amounts advanced tend to be greater than normal arrangements because of the delinquent status of the loans 
as of december  and  the outstanding principal balance of such delinquent loans was million and million  respectively  and the aggregate monthly amount of funds advanced by doral financial was million and million  respectively 
when doral financial sells mortgage loans to third parties  which serve as a source of cash  it also generally makes customary representations and warranties regarding the characteristics of the loans sold 
to the extent the loans do not meet specified characteristics investors are generally entitled to cause doral financial to repurchase such loans 
in addition to its servicing and warranty obligations  in the past doral financial s loan sale activities have included the sale of non conforming mortgage loans subject to recourse arrangements that generally require doral financial to repurchase or substitute the loans if the loans are days or more past due or otherwise in default up to a specified amount or limited to a period of time after the sale 
to the extent the delinquency ratios of the loans sold subject to recourse are greater than anticipated and doral financial is required to repurchase more loans than anticipated  doral financial s liquidity requirements would increase 
please refer to off balance sheet activities below for additional information on these arrangements 
in the past  doral financial sold or securitized mortgage loans with fnma on a partial or full recourse basis 
doral financial s contractual agreements with fnma authorize fnma to require doral financial to post collateral in the form of cash or marketable securities to secure such recourse obligation to the extent doral financial does not maintain an investment grade rating 
as of december   doral financial s maximum recourse exposure with fnma amounted to million and required the posting of a minimum of million in collateral to secure recourse obligations 
while deemed unlikely by doral financial  fnma has the contractual right to request collateral for the full amount of doral financial s recourse obligations 
any such request by fnma would have a material adverse effect on doral financial s liquidity and business

assets and liabilities doral financial s total assets were billion at december   compared to billion at total assets at december   when compared to were affected by a decrease of billion in the company s investment securities portfolio that resulted from sales of mortgage backed and other securities during the year as part of the execution of the company s strategy to de lever the balance sheet while continuing to shorten the duration of the investment portfolio 
also  during the second quarter of  in connection with its efforts to bid for the assets and liabilities of certain failed banks  the company sold million of non agency cmos whose future performance was considered risky 
the decrease in assets from securities sales was partially offset by an increase in net loans of million 
loan growth is primarily the result of acquiring commercial and industrial loan participation interests in loan syndications led by major us banks  offset in part by decreases in the puerto rico commercial real estate and construction loan portfolios from loan sales  charge offs and collections

commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as the conditions established in the contract are met 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses 
generally  the company does not enter into interest rate lock agreements with borrowers 
the company purchases mortgage loans and simultaneously enters into a sale and securitization agreement with the same counterparty during the period between trade and settlement date

risk management doral financial s business is subject to four broad categories of risks interest rate risk  credit risk  operational risk and liquidity risk 
doral financial has specific policies and procedures which have been designed to identify  measure and manage risks to which the company is exposed 
interest rate and market risk management interest rate risk refers to the risk that changes in interest rates may adversely affect the value of doral financial s assets and liabilities and its net interest income 
doral financial s risk management policies are designed with the goal of maximizing shareholder value with emphasis on stability of net interest income and market value of equity 
these policies are also targeted to remain well capitalized  preserve adequate liquidity  and meet various regulatory requirements 
the objectives of doral financial s risk management policies are pursued within the limits established by the board of directors of the company 
the board of directors has delegated the oversight of interest rate and liquidity risks to its risk policy committee 
doral financial s asset liability management committee alco has been created under the authority of the board of directors to manage the company s interest rate  market value of equity and liquidity risk 
the alco is primarily responsible for ensuring that doral financial operates within the company s established asset liability management policy guidelines and procedures 
the alco reports directly to the risk policy committee of the board of directors 
the alco is responsible for developing the company s asset liability management and liquidity strategy  establishing and monitoring of interest rate  pricing and liquidity risk limits to ensure compliance with the company s policies  overseeing product pricing and volume objectives for banking and treasury activities  and overseeing the maintenance of management information systems that supply relevant information for the alco to fulfill its responsibilities as it relates to asset liability management 
risk identification measurement and control doral financial manages interest rate exposure related to its assets and liabilities on a consolidated basis 
changes in interest rates can affect the volume of doral financial s mortgage loan originations  the net interest income earned on doral financial s portfolio of loans and securities  the amount of gain on the sale of loans and the value of doral financial s servicing assets  loans  investment securities and other retained interests 

table of contents as part of its interest rate risk management practices  doral financial has implemented measures to identify the interest rate risk associated with the company s assets  liabilities and off balance sheet activities 
the company has also developed policies and procedures to control and manage these risks and continues to improve its interest rate risk management practices 
the company currently manages its interest rate risk by principally focusing on the following metrics i net interest income sensitivity  ii market value of equity sensitivity  iii effective duration of equity  and iv maturity repricing gaps 
doral financial s asset liability management policies provide a limit structure based on these four metrics 
a single limit is defined for effective duration of equity 
net interest income sensitivity limits are set for instantaneous parallel rate shifts 
specific parallel rate shifts defined for net interest income and market value equity limits are bps  bps  bps  bps  bps  and bps 
net interest income sensitivity limits are established for different time horizons 
additional limits are defined for maturity repricing mismatches  however management continues to emphasize risk management and controls based on net interest income and market value of equity sensitivity as these measures incorporate the effect of existing asset liability mismatches 
the explanations below provide a brief description of the metrics used by the company and the methodologies assumptions employed in the estimation of these metrics net interest income sensitivity 
refers to the relationship between market interest rates and net interest income due to the maturity mismatches and repricing characteristics of doral financial s interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and off balance sheet positions 
to measure net interest income exposure to changes in market interest rates  the company uses earnings simulation techniques 
these simulation techniques allow for the forecasting of net interest income and expense under various rate scenarios for the measurement of interest rate risk exposures of doral financial 
primary scenarios include instantaneous parallel and non parallel rate shocks 
net interest income sensitivity is measured for time horizons ranging from twelve to sixty months and as such  serves as a measure of short to medium term earnings risk 
the basic underlying assumptions used in net interest income simulations are i the company maintains a static balance sheet  ii full reinvestment of funds in similar product instruments with similar maturity and repricing characteristics  iii spread assumed constant  iv prepayment rates on mortgages and mortgage related securities are modeled using multi factor prepayment model  v non maturity deposit decay and price elasticity assumptions are incorporated  and vi evaluation of embedded options is also taken into consideration 
to complement and broaden the analysis of earnings at risk the company also performs earning simulations for longer time horizons 
market value of equity sensitivity 
used to capture and measure the risks associated with longer term maturity and re pricing mismatches 
doral financial uses value simulation techniques for all financial components of the statement of financial condition 
valuation techniques include static cash flows analyses  stochastic models to qualify value of embedded options and prepayment modeling 
to complement and broaden the risk analysis  the company uses duration and convexity analysis to measure the sensitivity of the market value of equity to changes in interest rates 
duration measures the linear change in market value of equity caused by changes in interest rates  while  convexity measures the asymmetric changes in market value of equity caused by changes in interest rates due to the presence of options 
the analysis of duration and convexity combined provide a better understanding of the sensitivity of the market value of equity to changes in interest rates 
effective duration of equity 
the effective duration of equity is a broad measure of the impact of interest rate changes on doral financial s economic capital 
the measure summarizes the net sensitivity of assets and liabilities  adjusted for off balance sheet positions 
interest rate risk management strategy doral financial s current interest rate management strategy is implemented by the alco and is focused on reducing the volatility of the company s earnings as a result of changes in interest rates and to protect the market value of equity 
while the current strategy will also use a combination of derivatives and balance sheet management  more emphasis is placed on balance sheet management 

table of contents net interest income risk 
in order to protect net interest income against interest rate risk  the alco employs a number of tactics which are evaluated and adjusted in relation to prevailing market conditions 
internal balance sheet management practices are designed to reduce the re pricing gaps of the company s assets and liabilities 
however  the company will use derivatives  mainly interest rate swaps and interest rate caps  as part of its interest rate risk management activities 
interest rate swaps represent a mutual agreement to exchange interest rate payments  one party pays fixed rate and the other pays a floating rate 
for net interest income protection  doral financial typically enters into a fixed rate payer float receiver swaps to eliminate the variability of cash flows associated with the floating rate debt obligations 
market value of equity 
due to the composition of doral financial s assets and liabilities  the company has earnings exposure to rising interest rates 
the company measures the market value of all rate sensitive assets  liabilities and off balance sheet positions  and the difference between assets and liabilities  adjusted by off balance sheet positions  is termed market value of equity 
the company measures how the market value of equity fluctuates with different rate scenarios to measure risk exposure of economic capital or market value of equity 
management uses duration matching strategies to manage the fluctuations of market value of equity within the long term targets established by the board of directors of the company 
duration risk 
duration is a measure of the impact in magnitude and direction of changes on interest rates in the economic value of financial instruments 
in order to bring duration measures within the policy thresholds established by the company  management may use a combination of internal liability management techniques and derivative instruments 
derivatives such as interest rate swaps  treasury futures  eurodollar futures and forward contracts may be entered into as part of the company s risk management 
convexity risk 
convexity is a measure of how much duration changes as interest rates change 
for doral financial  convexity risk primarily results from mortgage prepayment risk 
as part of managing convexity risk management may use a combination of internal balance sheet management instruments or derivatives  such as swaptions  caps  floors  put or call options on interest rate indexes or related fixed income underlying securities ie eurodollar  treasury notes 
hedging related to mortgage banking activities 
as part of doral financial s risk management of mortgage banking activities  such as secondary market and servicing assets  the company enters into forward agreements to buy or sell mbs to protect the company against changes in interest rates that may impact the economic value of servicing assets or the pricing of marketable loan production 
hedging the various sources of interest rate risks related to mortgage banking activities is a complex process that requires sophisticated modeling  continuous monitoring and active management 
while doral financial balances and manages the various aspects relating to mortgage activities  there are potential risks to earnings associated to them 
the following bullets summarize some of these potential risks the valuation of msrs are recorded in earnings immediately within the accounting period in which the changes in value occur  whereas the impact of changes in interest rates are reflected in originations with a time lag and effects on servicing fee income occurs over time 
thus  even when mortgage activities could be protected from adverse changes in interest rates over a period of time on a cumulative basis they may display large variations in income from period to period 
the degree to which the natural hedge associated to mortgage banking ie originating and servicing offsets changes in servicing asset valuations may be imperfect  as it may vary over time 
origination volumes  the valuation of servicing assets  economic hedging activities and other related costs are impacted by multiple factors  which include  changes in the mix of new business  changes in the term structure of interest rates  changes in mortgage spreads mortgage basis to other rate benchmarks  and rate volatility  among others 
interrelation of all these factors is hard to predict and  as such  the ability to perfectly hedge their effects is limited 

table of contents doral financial s risk profile doral financial s goal is to manage market and interest rate risk within targeted levels established and periodically reviewed by the board of directors 
interest rate sensitivity represents the relationship between market interet rates and the net interest income due to existing maturity and repricing imbalances between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity is also defined as the relationship between market interest rates and the economic value of equity referred to market value of equity or mve 
the interest risk profile of the company is measured in the context of net interest income  market value of equity  maturity repricing gaps and effective duration of equity 
the risk profile of the company is managed by use of natural offsets generated by the different components of the balance sheet as a result of the normal course of business operations and through active hedging activities by means of both on balance sheet and off balance sheet transactions ie derivative instruments to achieve targeted risk levels 
the company s interest rate risk exposure may be asymmetric due to the presence of embedded options in products and transactions which allow clients and counterparties to modify the maturity of loans  securities  deposits and or borrowings 
examples of embedded options include the ability of a mortgagee to prepay his her mortgage or a counterparty exercising its puttable option on a structured funding transaction 
assets and liabilities with embedded options are evaluated taking into consideration the presence of options to estimate their economic price elasticity and also the effect of options in assessing maturity repricing characteristics of the company s balance sheet 
the embedded optionality is primarily managed by purchasing or selling options or by other active risk management strategies involving the use of derivatives  including the forward sale of mbs 
the company measures interest rate risk and has specific targets for various market rate scenarios 
general assumptions for the measurement of interest income sensitivity are i rate shifts are parallel and instantaneous throughout all benchmark yield curves and rate indexes  ii behavioral assumptions are driven by simulated market rates under each scenario ie prepayments  repricing of certain liabilities  iii static balance sheet assumed with cash flows reinvested at forecasted market rates ie forward curve  static spreads in similar instruments 
for net interest income the company monitors exposures and has established limits for time horizons ranging from one up to three years  although for risk management purposes earning exposures are forecasted for longer time horizons

as described above  doral financial uses derivatives to manage its exposure to interest rate risk caused by changes in interest rates 
derivatives are generally either privately negotiated over the counter otc contracts or standard contracts transacted through regulated exchanges 
otc contracts generally consist of swaps  caps and collars  forwards and options 
exchange traded derivatives include futures and options 
the company is subject to various interest rate cap agreements to manage its interest rate exposure 
interest rate cap agreements generally involve purchase of out of the money caps to protect the company from larger rate moves and to provide the company with positive convexity 
non performance by the counterparty exposes doral financial to interest rate risk

interest rate swap agreements generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying principal 
the company principally uses interest rate swaps to convert floating rate liabilities to fixed rate by entering into pay fixed receive floating interest rate swaps

doral financial uses derivatives to manage its market risk and generally accounts for such instruments on a mark to market basis with gains or losses charged to current operations as part of net gain loss on trading activities as they occur 
contracts with positive fair values are recorded as assets and contracts with negative fair values as liabilities  after the application of netting arrangements 
fair values of derivatives such as interest rate futures contracts or options are determined by reference to market prices 
fair values for derivatives purchased in the over the counter market are determined by valuation models and validated with prices provided by external sources 
the notional amounts of freestanding derivatives totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
notional amounts indicate the volume of derivative activity  but do not represent doral financial s exposure to market or credit risk 
the decrease in the notional amount of freestanding derivatives with respect to december  was due mainly to the rebalancing of economic hedges related to management of risks associated to servicing assets and secondary marketing activities 
derivatives hedge accounting 
doral financial seeks to designate derivatives under hedge accounting guidelines when it can clearly identify an asset or liability that can be hedged pursuant to the strict hedge accounting guidelines 
the notional amount of swaps treated under hedge accounting totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the company typically uses interest rate swaps to convert floating rate advances from fhlb to fixed rate by entering into pay fixed receive floating swaps 
in these cases  the company matches all of the terms in the advance from fhlb to the floating leg of the interest rate swap 
since both transactions are symmetrically opposite the effectiveness of the hedging relationship is high

the market risk of derivatives arises principally from the potential for changes in the value of derivative contracts based on changes in interest rates 
the credit risk of otc derivatives arises from the potential of counterparties to default on their contractual obligations 
to manage this credit risk  doral financial deals with counterparties of good credit standing  enters into master netting agreements whenever possible and monitors market on pledged collateral to minimize credit exposure 
master netting agreements incorporate rights of set off that provide for the net settlement of contracts with the same counterparty in the event of default 
as a result of the ratings downgrades affecting doral financial  counterparties to derivative contracts used for interest rate risk management purposes could increase the applicable margin requirements under such contracts  or could require the company to terminate such agreements

credit risk doral financial is subject to credit risk  particularly with respect to its investment securities and loans receivable 
for a discussion of credit risk on investment securities refer to note of the accompanying financial statements 
loans receivable are loans that doral financial holds for investment and  therefore  the company is at risk for the term of the loans 
because most of doral financial s loans are made to borrowers located in puerto rico and secured by properties located in puerto rico  the company is subject to credit risk tied to adverse economic  political or business developments and natural hazards  such as hurricanes  that may affect puerto rico 
the puerto rico economy has been in a recession since this has affected borrowers disposable incomes and their ability to make payments when due  causing an increase in delinquency and foreclosure rates 
the company believes that these conditions will continue to affect its credit quality 
in addition  there is evidence that property values have declined from their peak 
this has reduced borrowers capacity to refinance and increased the exposure to loss upon default 
this decline in prices and increases in expected defaults are incorporated into the loss rates used for calculating the company s allowance for loan and lease losses 
loans collateralized by land are under regulatory review in the us and its territories 
as of december  land collateralized loans totalled to million 
in addition  doral has outstanding a few construction loans with remnant land totaling million 
should our estimated land value change significantly  it may be necessary to record additional provisions for loan losses or charge offs that may be material to the company s financial statements 
the company also has a growing portfolio of commercial  construction and syndicated loans  geographically dominated by us loans  and performance of such loans is subject to the strength of the us economy 
with respect to mortgage loans originated for sale as part of its mortgage banking business  doral financial is generally at risk for any mortgage loan default from the time it originates the mortgage loan until the time it sells the loan or packages it into an mbs 
for residential mortgage loans that are retained as a loan investment  doral retains the credit risk from the time the loan is originated until the loan is paid 
with respect to fha loans  doral financial is insured as to principal by the hud against foreclosure loss 
va loans are guaranteed within a range of to of the principal amount of the loan subject to a maximum  ranging from  to  in addition to the mortgage collateral 
prior to  the company sold loans on a 
table of contents recourse basis as part of the ordinary course of business 
as part of such transactions  the company committed to make payments to remedy loan defaults or to repurchase defaulted loans 
refer to off balance sheet activities above for additional information regarding recourse obligations 
in mid  the company discontinued the practice of selling mortgage loans with recourse  except for recourse related to early payment defaults 
the residential mortgage portfolio includes loans that  at some point were repurchased pursuant to recourse obligations and  as a result  have a higher credit risk 
repurchases of delinquent loans from recourse obligations for the year ended december  amounted to million and resulted in a loss of million 
when repurchased from recourse obligations  loans are recorded at their market value  which includes a discount for poor credit performance 
doral financial provided land acquisition  development  and construction financing to developers of residential housing projects and  as consequence  has credit risk exposure to this sector 
construction loans extended to developers are typically adjustable rate loans  indexed to the prime interest rate with terms ranging generally from to months 
doral financial principally targeted developers of residential construction for single family primary home occupancy 
as a result of the negative outlook for the puerto rico economy and its adverse effect on the construction industry  in the fourth quarter of  the company ceased financing new housing projects in puerto rico 
the recorded balance for the puerto rico residential housing construction sector has decreased from million as of december   to million as of december  management expects that the amount of construction loans will continue to decrease in future years 
for the year ended december   the construction and land portfolio reflected lower delinquency when compared to december  due to the sale of a portfolio of construction loans and similar real estate owned property during the third quarter of for million to a third party  that included million of non performing loans as of june   net of million of charge offs approximately million as of december  
puerto rico and the company have experienced low levels of new home absorption in recent years due to the current economic environment 
however  in september  the governor of pr signed into law act no 
of which established various housing tax and other incentives to stimulate the sale of new and existing housing units 
the tax and other incentives  which include incentives or reductions relating to capital gains taxes  property taxes and property recording fees and stamps  will be effect until june  and are expected to have a favorable impact in the current economic environment and new home absorption in pr 
for the year ended december   the commercial real estate portfolio experienced an increase in late stage delinquency mainly attributed to adverse performance of the small commercial portfolio related to the continued recessionary conditions in puerto rico 
also  this portfolio was impacted by the classification to non performing loans of a current paying loan of million net of a charge off of million during the third quarter of management has taken certain actions to mitigate the risk in the portfolio  including retaining advisory services of third party providers in order to work out delinquent loans and prevent performing loans from becoming delinquent 
loan modifications and troubled debt restructurings tdr with puerto rico unemployment of many borrowers have temporarily lost the means to pay their loan contractual principal and interest obligations 
as a result of the economic hardships  a number of borrowers have defaulted on their debt obligations  including residential mortgage and other consumer loans 
the lower level of income and economic activity has also led to fewer new construction residential home sales  increased commercial real estate vacancy  and lower business revenues  which has led to increased defaults on commercial real estate  construction and land loans 
doral management has concluded that it is in the company s best interest  and in the best interest of the puerto rican economy and citizenry  if certain defaulted loans are restructured in a manner that keeps borrowers in their homes  or businesses operating  rather than foreclosing on the loan collateral if it is concluded that the borrower s payment difficulties are temporary and doral will in time collect the loan principal and agreed upon interest 

table of contents doral has created a number of loan modification programs to help borrowers stay in their homes and operate their businesses which also optimizes borrower performance and returns to doral 
in these cases  the restructure or loan modification fits the definition of tdr 
the programs are designed to provide temporary relief and  if necessary  longer term financial relief to the consumer loan customer and commercial borrower 
doral s consumer loan loss mitigation program including consumer loan products and residential mortgage loans  grants a concession for economic or legal reasons related to the borrowers financial difficulties that doral would not otherwise consider 
doral s loss mitigation programs can provide for one or a combination of the following i movement of unpaid principal and interest due to the end of the loan  ii extension of the loan term for up to ten years  iii deferral of principal payments for a period of time temporary interest only  and iv reduction of interest rates either permanently feature discontinued in or for a period of up to two years 
no programs adopted by doral provide for the forgiveness of contractually due principal or interest 
deferred principal and uncollected interest are added to the end of the loan term at the time of the restructuring and deferred interest is not recognized as income until collected 
doral wants to make these programs available only to those borrowers who have defaulted  or are likely to default  permanently on their loan and would lose their homes in foreclosure action absent some lender concession 
however  doral will move borrowers and properties to foreclosure if the company is not reasonably assured that the borrower will be able to repay all contractual principal or interest which is not forgiven in part or whole in any current or contemplated program 
in accordance with accounting guidance  loans determined to be tdrs are impaired and for purposes of estimating the alll must be individually evaluated for impairment 
for residential mortgage loans determined to be tdrs  on a monthly basis  the company pools tdrs with similar characteristics and performs an impairment analysis of discounted cash flows 
if a pool yields a present value below the recorded investment in the pool of loans  an impairment is recognized by a charge to the provision for loan and lease losses and a credit to the allowance for loan and lease losses 
for loss mitigated loans without a concession in the interest rate  the company performs an impairment analysis of discounted cash flows giving consideration to the probability of default and loss given foreclosure on those estimated cash flows  and records an impairment by charging the provision for loan and lease losses with a corresponding credit to the alll 
regarding the commercial loan loss mitigation programs including commercial real estate  commercial and industrial  construction and land loan portfolios  the determination is made on a loan by loan basis at the time of restructuring as to whether a concession was made for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulty that doral would not otherwise consider 
concessions made for commercial loans could include reductions in interest rates  extensions of maturity  waiving of borrower covenants  or other contract changes that would be considered a concession 
doral mitigates loan defaults for its commercial loan portfolios loans through its collections function 
the function s objective is to minimize both early stage delinquencies and losses upon default of larger credit relationships 
the group utilizes existing collections infrastructure of front end dialers  doorknockers  work out agents and third party consultants 
in the case of residential construction projects  the function uses a third party consultant to manage the projects in terms of construction  marketing and sales 
residential  other consumer or commercial loan modifications can result in returning a loan to accrual status when the criteria for returning a loan to performing status are met 
loan modifications also increase doral s interest income by returning a non performing loan to performing status  and cash flows by providing for payments to be made by the borrower  and decreases foreclosure and other real estate owned oreo costs by decreasing the number of foreclosed properties 
loan modifications can result in lower interest income to doral if executed on performing loans by deferring previously recognized interest and by temporarily lowering the interest rate on a loan 
doral continues to consider the modified loan as a non performing asset for purposes of estimating its allowance for loan and lease losses until the borrower has made at least six consecutive contractual payments or the equivalent in a lump sum 
at such time the loan will be treated as any other performing loan for purposes of estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses

in addition  any financial asset for which management estimates it will not collect contractual principal or interest is considered non performing when such judgment is made 
when income recognition is discontinued for a loan  all accrued but unpaid interest to date is reversed against current period income 
such interest  if collected in the future  is credited to income in the period of the recovery  and the loan returns to accrual status when it becomes current and or collectability is reasonably assured 
the company also places in non accrual status all residential construction loans classified as substandard whose sole source of payment is interest reserves funded by doral financial 
for the year ended december   doral financial would have recognized million  compared to million and million for the corresponding and periods  in additional interest income had all delinquent loans except fha va guaranteed loans been accounted for on an accrual basis 
this amount includes interest reversal on loans placed on non accrual status during the period 
for consumer loans primarily residential mortgage  all of doral s loss mitigation tools require that the borrower demonstrate the intent and ability to pay principal and interest on the loan 
doral must receive at least three consecutive monthly payments prior to qualifying the borrower for a loss mitigation product 
doral s loan underwriters must be reasonably assured of the borrower s future repayment and performance from their review of the borrower s circumstances  and when all the conditions are met  the customer is approved for a loss mitigation product and placed on a probation period 
when the loan is returned to accrual status  doral monthly reviews the loan to ensure that payments are made during the probationary period 
if a payment is not made during this probationary period the loan is immediately returned to non accrual status 
also  if a payment is missed during the probationary period  the loan reverts to its original terms  and collections foreclosure procedures begin from the point at which they stood prior to the restructure 
consumer loans not delinquent days or more that are eligible for loss mitigation products are subject to the same requirements as the delinquent consumer loans except the receipt of the three months of payment in advance of the restructures is waived 
for commercial loan loss mitigation which includes commercial real estate  commercial and industrial  construction and land loans  the loans are underwritten by the collections function  the intent and ability of the borrower to service the debt under the revised terms is scrutinized  and if approved for the tdr  the borrower is placed on a six month probationary period during which the customer is required to make six consecutive payments or equivalent in a lump sum before the loan is returned to accrual status 
upon receiving six consecutive months

of the total non performing consumer loans  non performing residential mortgage loans  excluding fha va guaranteed loans  decreased million since december  due 
table of contents primarily to loss mitigation and front end collections efforts as well as charge offs 
the decrease in non performing commercial loans was due primarily to the sale of a construction portfolio to a third party during the third quarter of that included approximately million of non performing loans as of december  there were also certain loan restructurings during which returned loans to performing status and a reduction in non performing us construction loans of million as one large loan was worked out 
the decrease in non performing construction and land loans was partially offset by an increase in non performing commercial real estate loans of million  or  due to the classification of a participation interest in a current paying loan of million net of a charge off of million in and deterioration in the performance of the small commercial loan portfolio 
the net decrease in non performing loans was offset by an increase of million in non performing fha va guaranteed residential loans as a result of doral s decision to repurchase fha insured loans from gnma securitizations in june and december as the non performance of doral originated loans exceeded certain gnma standards 
approximately million of the june repurchase were non performing  in addition to december repurchases which rolled into non performing loans during of approximately million 
these loans  while non performing  retain their fha insurance and present little credit loss potential to doral 
the increase in oreo and repossessed units of million resulted from increases of million in construction and land oreos  as the company foreclosed on a significant residential development during the third quarter of and million in commercial oreos due to foreclosure on three large loans during  partially offset by a million decrease in residential oreos 
the decrease in residential oreos is due to a million provision for oreo losses in the second quarter of as doral undertook efforts to ensure it was properly positioned to sell the residential oreos and looked to accelerate its oreo dispositions and sales of properties during the year 
during  doral sold properties out of the oreo  of these were sold in the second half of the year due to the change in policy for disposition and sales of properties 
as a result of differences in the mortgage foreclosure process between puerto rico and the states of the united states  the company does not expect to have any of the documentation and notarization problems in the mortgage foreclosure process that have been reported by other financial institutions in the united states 
as of december   the company reported a total of million of non performing residential mortgage loans excluding fha va guaranteed loans  which represents of total residential loans excluding fha va guaranteed loans and of total non performing loans 
doral financial does not hold a significant amount of adjustable interest rate  negative amortization  or other exotic credit features that are common in other parts of the united states 
however  as part of its loss mitigation programs  the company has granted certain concessions to borrowers in financial difficulties that have proven payment capacity which may include interest only periods or temporary interest rate reductions 
the payments for these loans will reset at the former payment amount unless the loan is restructured again or the restructured terms are extended

during the past two years  the company s construction and land loan portfolio has experienced a significant increase in default rates resulting from borrowers not being able to sell finished units within the loan term 
although the company has taken and continues to take steps to mitigate the credit risk underlying these loans  their ultimate performance will be affected by each borrower s ability to complete the project  maintain the pricing level of the housing units within the project  and sell the inventory of units within a reasonable timeframe

table of contents other real estate owned oreo doral financial believes that the value of the oreo reflected in its consolidated statements of financial condition represents a reasonable estimate of the properties sales price  net of disposition costs 
the fair value of the oreo is normally determined on the basis of internal and external appraisals and physical inspections

any losses in the carrying value of the properties arising from periodic appraisals are charged to expense in the period incurred 
holding costs  property taxes  maintenance and other similar expenses are charged to expense in the period incurred 
oreo foreclosures have increased in recent periods as the volume of the npls has increased and as doral has shortened the period from the initiation of foreclosure to possession of property by approximately months 
oreo sales improved in compared to due to the company s strategic decision to reduce pricing on the oreo portfolio in order to accelerate sales

for larger construction  commercial real estate  commercial and industrial loans and tdrs that are or more days past due or are otherwise considered to be impaired  management estimates the related alll based upon an analysis of each individual loans characteristics 
the alll estimate methodologies are described more fully in the following paragraphs 
residential mortgage 
the general allowance for residential mortgage loans is calculated based on the probability that loans within different delinquency buckets will default and  in the case of default  the extent of losses that the company expects to realize 
in determining the probabilities of default  the company considers recent experience of rolls of loans from one delinquency bucket into the next 
roll rates as of year end show that the proportion of loans rolling into subsequent buckets has remained constant 
in determining the allowance for loan and lease losses for residential mortgage loans  given the current economic trends in puerto 
table of contents rico  for purposes of forecasting the future behavior of the portfolio  doral financial determined that it should use the roll rates of relatively recent months  which show a more aggressive deteriorating trend than those in older periods 
using the older historical performance would yield lower probabilities of default that may not reflect recent macroeconomic trends 
severity of loss is calculated based on historical results from foreclosure and ultimate disposition of collateral 
historical results are adjusted for the company s expectation of housing prices 
severity assumptions for the residential portfolio range between and depending on the different loan types and loan to value ratios  and up to for second mortgages 
construction and land  commercial real estate and commercial and industrial 
the alll for performing construction and land  commercial real estate and commercial and industrial is estimated considering either the probability of the loan defaulting in the next twelve months and the estimated loss incurred in the event of default or the loan quality assigned to each loan and the estimated expected loss associated with that loan grade 
the probability of a loan defaulting is based upon doral financial s experience with its current portfolio 
the loan grade is assigned based upon management s review of the specific facts and circumstances associated with a particular credit 
the loss incurred upon default is based upon doral s actual experience in resolving defaulted loans 
construction and land  commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans with principal balances greater than million that are not performing  or when management estimates it may not collect all contractual principal and interest  are considered impaired and are measured for impairment individually 
loans are considered impaired when  based on current information and events it is probable that the borrower will not be able to fulfill its obligation according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
due to the current economic environment and management s perceived increase in risk in the commercial loan portfolio  during the third quarter of  management individually reviewed for impairment all commercial loans over  that were over days past due to better estimate the amount the company expects to receive 
during the fourth quarter of  management individually reviewed all commercial real estate loans over  that were over days past due  of all commercial loans between  and  and over days past due  as well as all new loans classified as substandard during the quarter 
in future periods  and while management s assessment of the inherent credit risk in the commercial portfolio continues to be high  the company will continue to evaluate on a quarterly basis of all commercial loans over days past due and between  and  so that in any one year period it would have individually evaluated for impairment of all substandard commercial loans between  and  as well as all substandard commercial real estate loans over  and all substandard commercial and construction loans over million 
the impairment loss  if any  on each individual loan identified as impaired is generally measured based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
as a practical expedient  impairment may be measured based on the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral net of disposition costs  if the loan is collateral dependent 
if foreclosure is probable  accounting guidance requires the measurement of impairment to be based on the fair value of the collateral  net of disposition costs 
since current appraisals were not available on all properties at quarter end  management determined its loss reserve estimates for these loans by estimating the fair value of the collateral 
in doing so  management considered a number of factors including the general change in price levels as indicated appraisals received compared to earlier appraisals of the same property  the price at which individual units could be sold in the current market  the period of time over which the units would be sold  the estimated cost to complete the units  the risks associated with completing and selling the units  the required rate of return on investment a potential acquirer may have and current market interest rates in the puerto rico market 
consumer 
the alll for consumer loans is estimated based upon the historical charge off rate using doral financial s historical experience 
the alll is supplemented by doral s policy to charge off all amounts in excess of the collateral value when the loan principal or interest is days or more days past due 
tdrs 
in accordance with accounting guidance  loans determined to be tdrs are impaired and for purposes of estimating the alll must be individually evaluated for impairment 
for residential mortgage loans determined to be tdrs  on a monthly basis  the company pools tdrs with similar characteristics and 
table of contents performs an impairment analysis of discounted cash flows 
if a pool yields a present value below the recorded investment in the pool of loans  an impairment is recognized by a charge to the provision for loan and lease losses and a credit to the allowance for loan and lease losses 
for loss mitigated loans without a concession in the interest rate  the company performs an impairment analysis of discounted cash flows giving consideration to the probability of default and loss given foreclosure on those estimated cash flows  and records an impairment by charging the provision for loan and lease losses with a corresponding credit to the alll 
generally  the percentage of the allowance for loan and lease losses to non performing loans will not remain constant due to the nature of doral financial s loan portfolios  which are primarily collateralized by real estate 
the collateral for each non performing mortgage loan is analyzed to determine potential loss exposure  and  in conjunction with other factors  this loss exposure contributes to the overall assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
on an ongoing basis  management monitors the loan portfolio and evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance  management considers such factors as default probabilities  internal risk ratings based on borrowers financial stability  external credit ratings  management strength  earnings and operating environment  probable loss and recovery rates  and the degree of risk inherent in the loan portfolios 
allocated general reserves are supplemented by a macroeconomic or emerging risk reserve 
this portion of the total allowance for loan and lease losses reflects management s evaluation of conditions that are not directly reflected in the loss factors used in the determination of the allowance 
the conditions evaluated in connection with the macroeconomic and emerging risk allowance include national and local economic trends  industry conditions within the portfolios  recent loan portfolio performance  loan growth  changes in underwriting criteria and the regulatory and public policy environment 
loans considered by management to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance for loan and lease losses 
recoveries on loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
provisions for loan and lease losses are charged to expenses and credited to the allowance in amounts deemed appropriate by management based upon its evaluation of the known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
while management believes that the current allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate  future additions to the allowance may be necessary 
if economic conditions change substantially from the assumptions used by doral financial in determining the allowance for loan and lease losses further changes in the allowance may be required

the provision for loan and lease losses for the year ended december   reflected an increase of million compared to the corresponding period  primarily in non fha va residential mortgage  commercial real estate and construction and land portfolios 
the provision for loan and lease losses for the residential mortgage portfolio increased by million  or  for the year ended december   when compared to the corresponding period 
the increase in the provision for loan losses on residential mortgage loans was driven by i an increase of million due to tdrs individually evaluated for impairment  ii an increase of million related to the impact of net charge offs on the allowance  iii million due to transfers of foreclosed loans to oreo  and this was partially offset by million due to delinquency improvement 
the provision for loan and lease losses for the commercial real estate portfolio increased by million for the year ended december   when compared to the corresponding period due to i a million provision related to a reduction in the threshold for individually evaluating impaired loans from million to  ii an million provision due to the adverse classification of a participation interest in a current paying loan of million for which a charge off over allowance was recorded during the year  iii an million additional provision on loans individually measured for impairment  iv a million provision due to tdrs during the year which are individually evaluated for impairment  and v a million provision as loans rolled to delinquency 
the provision for loan and lease losses on the construction and land loan portfolio increased million during primarily due to the sale of a construction portfolio to a third party during the third quarter of that resulted in 
table of contents additional provisions of million  this offset by the release of million in reserve as one project loan was worked out 
in general  the increase in the provision for loan and lease losses during was largely driven by the impact of loss mitigation efforts including the sale of a portion of the construction loan portfolio  delinquencies trends  properties in foreclosure  decreases in real estate values  an increase in severities in the determination of the provision due to strategic decision to accelerate oreo dispositions and the continued deterioration in the puerto rico economy 
the provision for loan and lease losses for the year ended december   was offset by net charge offs of million  which included million related to the sale of certain construction loans  million related to a classified participation interest  million related to partial charge offs on residential mortgage loans during the period  million related to other consumer loans as those rolled to the and over delinquency bucket  as well as charge offs of previously reserved balances as a confirmed loss determinations are reached 
net charge offs on residential mortgage loans increased due to the implementation in of the company s real estate valuation policy under which the company obtains assessments of collateral value for residential mortgage loans over days past due and any outstanding balance in excess of the value of the property less cost to sell is classified as loss and written down by charging the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the allowance for loan and lease losses coverage ratios as of december  and including and excluding the effect of partial charge offs and credit related discounts were as follows table gg allowance for loans and lease losses coverage ratios december  december  alll plus partial charge offs and discount as a of alll as a of alll plus partial charge offs and discount as a of alll as a of loans npls loans npls loans npls loans npls consumer residential mortgage consumer total consumer commercial commercial real estate commercial and industrial construction and land total commercial total loans and npl amounts are increased by the amount of partial charge offs and discounts 
loans and npl amounts are not increased by the amount of partial charge offs and discounts 
excludes fha va guaranteed loans and loans on saving deposits 
after consideration of partial charge offs and credit related discounts  and in part due to the decrease in non performing loans  the coverage ratios are up basis points and basis points for the allowance plus partial charge offs and credit related discounts and as a percentage of all loans  and percentage of non performing loans  respectively 
doral discontinued new construction lending in puerto rico in  new commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending in puerto rico in  and significantly tightened its residential underwriting standards in doral s seasoned vintages  where problems have been identified and addressed in previous periods  require smaller additional provisions at this time 
considering the effect of the partial charge offs and credit related discounts  the company s coverage ratio was as of december  and as of december  in addition to the partial charge offs reflected in the ratios above  the company took a charge off of million during the second quarter of  on loans sold to a third party during the third quarter of in exchange for cash and a note 
table of contents receivable of million 
doral reports the million note received as a construction loan 
giving consideration to these additional charge offs  the adjusted coverage ratio allowance for and lease losses adjusted for partial charge offs  credit related discounts and construction loan charge offs on the portfolio sold  to loans receivable would be  an increase of basis points compared to the same ratio as of december  the adjusted coverage ratio for the construction loan portfolio after giving consideration to the charge off of construction loans sold in would be  an increase of basis compared to the same ratio as of december  the allowance for loan and lease losses was of period end loans receivable excluding fha va guaranteed loans and loans on savings deposits at december   a decrease of basis points compared with at december  the allowance for loan and lease losses to non performing loans excluding non performing loans held for sale was  an increase of basis points compared to as of december  mortgage lending is the company s principal line of business and has historically reflected significant recoveries and low levels of losses 
nevertheless  due to current economic conditions in puerto rico  and increases in loss severities in this portfolio  the company increased its allowance during non performing residential mortgage loans excluding fha va guaranteed loans decreased million  or  and the related allowance for loan and lease losses increased million or during the year ended december  compared with in  charge offs of residential mortgage loans were driven by the implementation of the company s real estate valuation policy under which the company obtains assessments of collateral value for residential mortgage loans that are over days past due and any outstanding balance in excess of the value of the property less cost to sell is classified as loss and written down by charging the allowance for loans and lease losses 
the construction and land loans portfolio decreased million for the year ended december   mainly due to net charge offs of million 
construction and land npls decreased million as a result of the sale of construction loan portfolio that included approximately million non performing loans as of december  there were also certain restructures and a reduction in non performing us construction loans of million as one large loan was worked out 
the commercial real estate loan portfolio decreased million during since the company is not actively lending in this line of business and due to partial charge offs 
non performing commercial real estate loans increased million in as a result of the deterioration in economic conditions in puerto rico and the classification of a participation in interest in a current paying loan of million 
the allowance for loan and lease losses for this portfolio increased million during the following table summarizes the company s loans individually reviewed for impairment and its related allowance table hh impaired loans and related allowance december  december  in thousands impaired loans with allowance impaired loans without allowance total impaired loans related allowance average impaired loan portfolio as part of the regular loan workout cycle  the company charges off the portion of impaired loans that it considers a confirmed loss 
accordingly  certain loans considered impaired and loans individually measured for impairment are carried at book balance that has already been reduced by charge offs  and therefore  carry a lower dollar allowance 
under some circumstances  the economics of a particular credit relationship suggest that the underlying loans are sufficiently collateralized and that no specific reserve is necessary 
the company 
table of contents does not allocate general reserves for those loans for which an impairment analysis has been conducted and for which the impairment measure was zero 
counterparty risk the company has exposure to many different counterparties  and it routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  and other institutional clients 
loans  derivatives investments  repurchase agreements  other borrowings  and receivables  among others  expose the company to counterparty risk 
many of these transactions expose the company to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client 
in addition  the company s credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by it cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to the company 
there can be no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company has procedures in place to mitigate the impact of default among its counterparties 
the company requests collateral for most credit exposures with other financial institutions and monitors these on a regular basis 
nevertheless  market volatility could impact the valuation of collateral held by the company and result in losses 
operational risk operational risk includes the potential for financial losses resulting from failed or inadequate controls 
operational risk is inherent in every aspect of business operations  and can result from a range of factors including human judgment  process or system failures  or business interruptions 
operational risk is present in all of doral financial s business processes  including financial reporting 
the company has adopted a policy governing the requirements for operational risk management activities 
this policy defines the roles and responsibilities for identifying key risks  key risks indicators  estimation of probabilities and magnitudes of potential losses and monitoring trends 
overview of operational risk management doral financial has a corporate wide chief risk officer  who is responsible for implementing the process of managing the risks faced by the company 
the chief risk officer is responsible for coordinating risk identification and monitoring throughout doral financial with the company s internal audit group

general business  economic and political conditions  puerto rico economy and fiscal condition the company s business and earnings are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in puerto rico and the united states 
significant business and economic conditions include short term and long term interest rates  inflation and the strength of the puerto rico and us economies and housing markets 
if any of these conditions deteriorate  the company s business and earnings could be adversely affected 
for example  business and economic conditions that negatively impact household income could decrease the demand for residential mortgage loans and increase the number of customers who become delinquent or default on their 
table of contents loans  or  a dramatically rising interest rate environment could decrease the demand for loans and negatively affect the value of the company s investments and loans 
inflation also generally results in increases in general and administrative expenses 
interest rates normally increase during periods of high inflation and decrease during periods of low inflation 
please refer to risk management above for a discussion of the effects of changes of interest rates on doral financial s operations 
markets in the united states and elsewhere have experienced extreme volatility and disruption for over two years  continuing through the year ended december  the united states  europe and japan entered into recessions during that persisted through most of  despite past and expected governmental intervention in the world s major economies 
doral financial s business activities and credit exposure are concentrated in puerto rico 
consequently  its financial condition and results of operations are highly dependent on economic conditions in puerto rico 
the economy of puerto rico is closely linked to the united states economy  as most of the external factors that affect the puerto rico economy other than the price of oil are determined by the policies of  and economic conditions prevailing in  the united states 
these external factors include exports  direct investment  the amount of federal transfer payments  the level of interest rates  the rate of inflation  and tourist expenditures 
during the fiscal year ended june   approximately of puerto rico s exports went to the us mainland  which was also the source of approximately of puerto rico s imports 
in the past  the economy of puerto rico has generally followed economic trends in the overall united states economy 
however  in recent years  economic growth in puerto rico has lagged behind growth in the united states 
the dominant sectors of the puerto rico economy in terms of production and income are manufacturing and services 
the manufacturing sector has undergone fundamental changes over the years as a result of an increased emphasis on higher wage  high technology industries  such as pharmaceuticals  biotechnology  computers  microprocessors  professional and scientific instruments  and certain high technology machinery and equipment 
the services sector  including finance  insurance  real estate  wholesale and retail trade  and tourism  also plays a major role in the economy 
it ranks second to manufacturing in contribution to puerto rico s gross domestic product and leads all sectors in providing employment 
puerto rico s economy is currently in a recession that began in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year that ended june  although the puerto rico economy is closely linked to the united states economy  for fiscal years  and  puerto rico s real gross national product decreased by  and  respectively  while the united states economy grew at a rate of and during fiscal years and  respectively  and contracted at a rate of during fiscal year according to the puerto rico planning board s latest projections  puerto rico s real gross national product was projected to contract by during fiscal year puerto rico s real gross national product for fiscal year  however  is projected to grow by 
the number of persons employed in puerto rico during fiscal year averaged  a decrease of compared to the previous fiscal year 
during the first six months of fiscal year  total employment averaged  a decline of compared with the same period of the previous fiscal year  and the unemployment rate averaged 
future growth of the puerto rico economy will depend on several factors including the condition of the united states economy  the relative stability of the price of oil imports  the exchange value of the united states dollar  the level of interest rates  the effectiveness of the recently approved changes to the puerto rico income tax code and other tax laws  and the continuing economic uncertainty generated by the puerto rico government s fiscal condition 
the economy of puerto rico is very sensitive to the price of oil in the global market 
puerto rico does not have significant mass transit available to the public and most of its electricity is currently powered by oil  making it highly sensitive to fluctuations in oil prices 
a substantial increase in the price of oil could impact adversely the economy by reducing disposable income and increasing the operating costs of most businesses and government 
consumer spending is particularly sensitive to wide fluctuations in oil prices
