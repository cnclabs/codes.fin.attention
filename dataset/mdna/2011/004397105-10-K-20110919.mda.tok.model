item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report on form k  particularly in risk factors 
see special note regarding forward looking statements 
overview products and markets we believe we are the premier radiation oncology company based on our history of rapid innovation and our leading edge technologies designed specifically to deliver radiosurgery  stereotactic body radiation therapy  intensity modulated radiation therapy  image guided radiation therapy  and adaptive radiation therapy that is tailored to the specific needs of each patient 
our suite of products includes the cyberknife system and the tomotherapy system 
the systems are highly complementary offerings  serving distinct patient populations treated by the same medical specialty 
the cyberknife system is a robotic system designed to deliver radiosurgery treatments to cancer tumors anywhere in the body 
it is the only dedicated  full body radiosurgery system on the market 
radiosurgery is an alternative to traditional surgery for tumors and is performed on an outpatient basis in one to five treatment sessions 
it allows for the treatment of patients who otherwise would not be treated with radiation  who may not be good candidates for surgery  or who desire non surgical treatments 
the use of radiosurgery with the cyberknife system to treat tumors throughout the body has grown significantly in recent years  but currently represents only a small portion of the patients who develop tumors treatable with the cyberknife system 
we believe that the long term success of the cyberknife system is dependent on a number of factors including the following change in medical practice to utilize radiosurgery more regularly as an alternative to surgery or other treatments  greater awareness among doctors and patients of the benefits of radiosurgery with the cyberknife system  continued evolution in clinical studies demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the use of the cyberknife system to treat tumors in various parts of the body  continued advances in technology which improve the quality of treatments and ease of use of the cyberknife system  improved access to radiosurgery with the cyberknife system in various countries through regulatory approvals and or medical insurance reimbursement rates  and expansion of cyberknife system sales in countries throughout the world 
the tomotherapy systems are advanced  fully integrated and versatile radiation therapy systems for the treatment of a wide range of cancer types 
we began selling tomotherapy systems after our acquisition of tomotherapy incorporated on june  radiation therapy is used in a variety of ways  often to treat tissue surrounding a tumor area after surgical removal of the tumor and also as the primary treatment for tumors 
radiation therapy treatments impact both cancer cells as well as healthy tissue  therefore the total prescribed radiation dose is divided into many fractions and delivered in an average of to treatment sessions over several weeks 
radiation therapy has been widely available 
table of contents and used in developed countries for decades  though many developing countries do not currently have a sufficient number of linacs to adequately treat their domestic cancer patient populations 
the number of radiation therapy systems in use and sold each year is currently many times larger than for radiosurgery systems 
large companies  including varian medical systems  inc  elekta ab and siemens ag  generate most sales in this market 
while the market for radiation therapy systems is very large and well established  growth in demand for radiation therapy system is generally considered to be lower than for radiosurgery systems 
we believe the tomotherapy systems offer clinicians and patients significant benefits over other radiation therapy systems in the market 
we believe our ability to capture more sales in this established market will be influenced by a number of factors including the following greater awareness among doctors and patients of the benefits of radiation therapy using tomotherapy systems  advances in technology which improve the quality of treatments and ease of use of tomotherapy systems  and expansion of tomotherapy system sales in countries throughout the world 
sale of our products generating revenue from the sale of our systems is a lengthy process 
selling our systems  from first contact with a potential customer to a complete order  generally spans six months to two years and involves personnel with multiple skills 
the time from receipt of a complete order to revenue recognition is governed generally by the time required by the customer to build  renovate or prepare the treatment room for installation of the system 
this time varies quite a bit  generally from to months 
in the united states  we sell to customers  including hospitals and stand alone treatment facilities  directly through our sales organization 
outside the united states  we sell to customers in over countries directly and through distributors 
we have sales and service offices in france  belgium  germany  england  spain  turkey  russia  india  japan  hong kong  china and singapore 
as of june   we had employees in our sales and marketing organization 
the following table shows the number of systems installed by geographic region as of june  cyberknife systems tomotherapy systems total americas asia europe total international sales of our products account for a significant and growing portion of our total revenue 
revenue derived from sales outside of the united states was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively  and international sales as a percentage of our total revenue was in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal we believe the increase in international sales for the year ended june  is due to a number of factors  including the following increased focus on international markets through regionalization  different impact of the economic downturn by country  greater significance of government affiliated hospital customers  different competitive dynamics  and growth in select country markets 

table of contents business highlights on june   we completed the acquisition of tomotherapy  a creator of advanced radiation therapy solutions for cancer care  by acquiring all tomotherapy common stock in exchange for cash and shares of accuray common stock 
as a result of the acquisition  tomotherapy became a wholly owned subsidiary of accuray 
the total consideration that we paid to tomotherapy stockholders was approximately million  or per share of tomotherapy common stock  in a combination of cash per share and stock shares of accuray common stock per share of tomotherapy common stock 
in december  the us food and drug administration fda granted us k clearance to market lung optimized treatment  a new component of the cyberknife vsi system 
the k clearance enables us to provide physicians with greater flexibility in delivering radiosurgery treatments to patients with lung cancer  the most common and deadly cancer worldwide 
lung optimized treatment is a new tool developed to meet the clinical demand for more flexibility in treating lung cancer patients with radiosurgery and the desire to move away from reliance on fiducial markers 
in november  the tomohd system was introduced 
this system includes both our tomohelical tm and tomodirect tm treatment modalities and enables cancer centers to treat a significantly expanded patient population 
backlog cyberknife systems for fiscal and  accuray backlog for the cyberknife product consists of the sum of deferred revenue  future un invoiced payments that our customers are contractually committed to make  signed  non contingent cyberknife system sale agreements that meet the detailed criteria set forth below  service plans and minimum payment requirements associated with our shared ownership program 
in order for a cyberknife system sale agreement to be counted as backlog  it must meet the following criteria the contract is signed and properly executed by both the customer and us  the contract is non contingent it either has cleared all its contingencies or contains no contingencies when signed  we have received a deposit or a letter of credit  or the sale is a direct channel sale to a government entity  the specific end customer site has been identified by the customer in the written contract or written amendment  and less than years have passed since the contract met all the criteria above 
included in customers agreements to purchase a cyberknife system is an option to select the type and term of service coverage that they desire 
backlog includes the value of this service coverage selected by customers in their original agreement to purchase a cyberknife system 
before installation of the cyberknife system is complete and service commences  the customer must complete and sign a separate service agreement for service coverage ie  diamond or emerald service 
if at the time of signing the service agreement a customer selects a different type of service than the option selected in the cyberknife system purchase agreement  our backlog is adjusted to reflect the service agreement the customer signed 
at june  and  our backlog for the cyberknife product was approximately million and million  respectively 
of this backlog  million and million represented cyberknife system sales at june  and  respectively  and million and 
table of contents million represented revenue from service plans and other recurring revenues at june  and  respectively 
we anticipate that this backlog will be recognized over the next five years as installations occur  upgrades are delivered and services are provided 
tomotherapy systems historically tomotherapy reported only sales of tomotherapy systems in backlog 
orders for service plans were not included in reported backlog 
orders for the sale of tomotherapy systems were included in backlog based on an internal evaluation of the order rather than based on specific criteria as outlined above for cyberknife orders 
from june  through june   we continued use of the method used by tomotherapy in evaluating whether orders for tomotherapy systems were included in backlog 
evaluated in accordance with the methods utilized historically by tomotherapy  backlog for tomotherapy systems totaled approximately million at june  although our backlog includes only contractual agreements from our customers to purchase cyberknife systems or tomotherapy systems  we cannot make assurances that we will convert backlog into recognized revenue due to factors outside our control including without limitation  changes in customers needs  changes in reimbursement  changes to regulatory requirements  or other cancellation of orders 
backlog reporting beginning fiscal beginning in fiscal the fiscal year beginning july   we will report backlog in a manner that is common for all of our products 
products orders for systems  upgrades  and our shared ownership program will be reported in backlog  excluding amounts attributable to warranty service  training and installation 
service orders for service  warranty  installation  training and other recurring revenues will not be reported in backlog 
previously  orders for service were reported in backlog for cyberknife systems but not for tomotherapy systems 
for orders that cover both products and services  only the portion of the order that will be recognized as product revenue will be reported as backlog 
the portion of the order that will be recognized as service revenue for example  warranty service  installation and training will not be included in reported backlog 
additionally  orders for tomotherapy that met the historical tomotherapy backlog criteria have been grandfathered into  and are included in  our backlog  with the exception of orders that would have aged out as of june  tomotherapy previously did not have an age out criteria  so we have adjusted the tomotherapy backlog to age out orders where years have passed from the time the order entered tomotherapy backlog 
as of june   product only backlog was million in total  comprised of million for cyberknife systems and million for tomotherapy systems 
these amounts exclude any portion of orders that will be reflected as service revenue and therefore are different than the amounts reported above 
going forward in fiscal  in order for the product portion of a sales agreement to be counted as backlog  it must meet the following criteria the contract is signed and properly executed by both the customer and us 
a customer purchase order that is signed and incorporates the terms of our contract quote will be considered equivalent to a signed and executed contract  the contract is non contingent it either has cleared all its contingencies or contains no contingencies when signed  we have received a deposit  a letter of credit  the sale is a direct channel sale to a government entity  or the product has shipped to a customer with credit sufficient to cover the deposit  
table of contents the specific end customer site has been identified by the customer in the written contract or written amendment  and less than years have passed since the contract met all the criteria above 
material weakness in internal control in connection with our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting  we identified a material weakness relating to our accounting for significant  non routine transactions which prevented the timely preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our efforts to remediate this material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting consist of the following corrective action hiring additional highly skilled accountants 
however  even after this corrective action is implemented  the effectiveness of our controls and procedures may be limited by a variety of risks 
although we have taken measures to remediate previously reported material weaknesses as well as other significant deficiencies and control deficiencies  we cannot assure you that we have identified all  or that we will not in the future have additional material weaknesses  significant deficiencies and control deficiencies

this includes million of net revenue from the sale of tomotherapy products and services since the june  close of the acquisition million of products revenue  million of services revenue  and million of other revenue 
revenue recognized for cyberknife systems sold under our platinum plan declined to million during fiscal from million in fiscal prior to fiscal  we sold cyberknife systems with our platinum service plan  which provided specified upgrades over the term of service coverage purchased by the customer 
in accordance with applicable software revenue recognition rules  we deferred recognition of all revenue product and service until the last specified upgrade was delivered 
after this point  the previously deferred revenue was recognized as revenue over the then remaining term of service coverage 
all specified upgrades on systems sold with platinum service plans were delivered by the end of fiscal and all product revenue related to systems sold with platinum service plans was recognized by the end of fiscal during fiscal  cyberknife systems were installed  of which were sold and one was attributable to our shared ownership program  compared to systems installed  including sold and one attributable to our shared ownership program during fiscal excluding million of revenue previously deferred under platinum service agreements  service revenue totaled million for fiscal  an increase of million from fiscal service revenue excluding platinum  as a result of continued growth in our installed base covered by service plans and the addition of service revenue for tomotherapy products 
other revenue increased due to facility construction work that we managed for customers in fiscal

by comparison  during fiscal  we recognized products revenue of million associated with cyberknife systems  which included units sold and two units purchased out of our shared ownership program 
the increase in fiscal is due primarily to the remaining deferred revenue for units sold in prior periods recognized in fiscal in accordance with our revenue recognition policy and an increase in upgrades and accessories sold 
excluding revenue recognized for systems sold under our platinum plan  we recognized non platinum service revenue of million for fiscal  which increased approximately million from fiscal  due to the continued growth in our installed base under service plans 
we recognized million of revenue in fiscal from systems sold under our platinum plan  million for products revenue and million for services revenue 
we recognized million of revenue in fiscal from systems sold under our platinum plan  million for products revenue and million for services revenue 
by the end of june  we had satisfied all upgrade delivery obligations on the units sold under our platinum plan 
once all upgrade delivery obligations have been satisfied  revenue is recognized over the remaining term of the contract service term 
revenue from upgrade services in japan  classified as other revenue in our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal  decreased approximately million from fiscal due to a decrease in upgrade services provided to our installed systems in japan 
shared ownership program revenue for fiscal decreased approximately million from fiscal  primarily due to the sale of one cyberknife system at the end of fiscal that had been in our shared ownership program 
gross profit years ended june  dollars in thousands of net revenue dollars in thousands of net revenue dollars in thousands of net revenue gross profit products services other our gross profit margin was higher by percentage points in fiscal than in fiscal due to the improved margin on products revenue  offset partially by a reduction in the gross profit margin on services revenue 
the improvement in our overall gross profit margin was partially offset by negative gross profit margin associated with the tomotherapy revenues included in our results since the acquisition closed on june  the gross profit margin on products revenue rose by percentage points due mainly to the commencement of shipments of our newest cyberknife model  the cyberknife vsi  which sells for a higher average price than the predecessor model  the g the higher average price  combined with improved manufacturing efficiency and cost reductions  resulted in a higher gross profit margin on the cyberknife vsi model  which accounted for the majority of sales in fiscal 
table of contents the gross profit margin on services revenue declined by percentage points due to the inclusion in our fiscal results of tomotherapy services revenue for the period from june through june  the tomotherapy services revenue incurred a negative gross margin in our financial statements during this period 
excluding the results of tomotherapy during this day period  the gross profit margin on service in fiscal was approximately unchanged from fiscal in accordance with purchase accounting standards  a number of adjustments were recorded to the value of assets and liabilities of tomotherapy as of the closing of the acquisition on june  these included the write up of inventory based on selling price rather than cost of manufacturing  the write down of deferred product revenue  the write up of deferred service revenue  and the recording of intangible assets related to developed technology and to backlog existing at the time of the acquisition 
on the acquisition date  deferred service and product revenues were valued at cost plus a reasonable margin 
including the results of these and other purchase accounting adjustments  the results from the sale of tomotheraphy products and services for the period june to june  reflect a negative gross margin 
products and other revenue was reduced by million while products and other cost of revenues was increased by million 
services revenue was increased by million and services cost of revenues was increased by million 
we expect that the impact of the purchase accounting adjustments to inventory and deferred revenues will flow through our statement of operations from the date of the acquisition through the third quarter of fiscal the million of intangible assets assigned to backlog will be charged to cost of revenues over a month period from acquisition through august the million of intangible assets assigned to developed technology will be charged to cost of revenues over a six year period from acquisition through fiscal the million of intangible assets assigned to distributor license will be charged to cost of revenues over a year period from acquisition through december gross profit as a percentage of net revenue for fiscal decreased from fiscal this decrease is due to a change in the mix of revenue sources  as well as changes in the gross profit margin for these revenue sources 
services revenue  with a gross profit margin lower than for products revenue  increased as a percentage of total net revenue due to the continued installation of new systems and a decline in products revenue 
in addition  product margins declined due to a number of factors including a trend towards higher functionality configurations which carry higher costs 
the increase in service revenue margins was attributable to a greater number of systems on a service contract and lower replacement parts consumption over the prior year 
shared ownership program revenue for fiscal  included in products revenue  decreased primarily due to the sale of units in the shared ownership program and reduction in residual revenue from the units sold in prior years

table of contents the provision for income taxes for fiscal decreased  from fiscal  resulting in a  net benefit 
in fiscal  we recorded an increase in foreign taxes of million as compared to the prior year as the result of changes in our jurisdictional mix of income 
federal taxes reflected million additional benefit compared to the prior year due to benefits we recognized as the result of the enactment of the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of  which permits some relief from federal alternative minimum tax 
as of june   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively  including million federal net operating loss carryforwards and million of state net operating loss carryforwards from the acquisition of tomotherapy 
these federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are available to offset future taxable income  if any  in varying amounts and will begin to expire in for federal and for state purposes  respectively 
such net operating loss carryforwards include tax benefits from employee option exercises in excess of the share based compensation expense that has been recognized for those awards in accordance with accounting standards codification topic  stock compensation 
we will record approximately million as a credit to additional paid in capital if and when such excess benefits are ultimately realized 
we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
if not utilized  the federal tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in  while the state tax credits have no expiration date 
in addition  among other matters  realization of the entire deferred tax asset is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the carryforwards 
due to the inconsistent history of net operating income as adjusted for permanent differences  we cannot conclude that the net domestic deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized 
accordingly  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our domestic net deferred tax assets 
at june   there was no provision for us income tax for undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as it is currently our intention to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside the us if repatriated  these earnings could result in a tax expense at the current us federal statutory tax rate of  subject to available net operating losses and other factors

the decrease in deferred revenue  net of deferred cost of revenue  was primarily a result of the recognition of revenue previously deferred for systems sold under our platinum plan  partially offset by differences between invoicing customers for products and services and the recognition of the invoicing as revenue 
the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was due to an insurance receivable amount recorded for insurance claims 
accounts payable decreased as a result of the timing of the receipt of invoices and when payment was made 
positive cash flow from working capital changes includes an increase of million of accrued liabilities  which was primarily due to an increase in compensation accruals and taxes payable due to higher profitability compared to the prior fiscal year

the increase in inventories was due primarily to an increase in our business volume and the increase in our worldwide installed base and associated service inventory requirements 
positive cash flow from working capital changes include an increase in accrued liabilities of million  of which million was related to the inventory investigation in the first quarter and the balance was due to the timing differences between the receipt of goods and service and vendor payments and a decrease in restricted cash of million 
the decrease in restricted cash is due to the release of amounts related to contracts with customers requiring that deposited cash amounts be secured via letter of credit until delivery of the cyberknife unit occurs 
non cash charges included million of share based compensation  million of charges for write downs of inventory and million of depreciation and amortization expense

operating capital and capital expenditure requirements our future capital requirements depend on numerous factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the following revenue generated by sales of our products  our shared ownership program and service plans  costs associated with our sales and marketing initiatives and manufacturing activities  facilities  equipment and it systems required to support current and future operations  rate of progress and cost of our research and development activities  
table of contents costs of obtaining and maintaining fda and other regulatory clearances of our products  effects of competing technological and market developments  number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions  and costs associated with the integration of tomotherapy 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least months 
we estimate that capital expenditures will be in the range of million to million during fiscal if these sources of cash and cash equivalents are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights senior to those associated with our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
additional financing may not be available at all  or in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts 
contractual obligations and commitments the following is a schedule summarizing our obligations to make future payments under contractual obligations as of june  and the notes that we issued in august payments due by period total less than year years years more than years notes operating leases total these amounts represent principal and interest cash payments over the life of the debt obligations  including anticipated interest payments that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
any conversion  redemption or purchase of notes would impact our cash payments 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  as well as revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities 
actual results could therefore differ materially from those estimates if actual conditions differ from our assumptions 

table of contents all of our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the methods  estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
management believes the critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  share based compensation  income taxes  legal and other contingencies and corporate bonus accruals 
revenue recognition in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted accounting standards update  or asu   multiple deliverable revenue arrangements amendments to accounting standards codification  or asc  topic  revenue recognition  and asu  certain arrangements that include software elements amendments to financial accounting standards board  or fasb  asc topic  software 
we adopted these new standards on a prospective basis  therefore  they apply only to revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified beginning july  the revised guidance primarily provides two significant changes it requires us to allocate revenues in an arrangement using best estimated selling prices  or besp  of deliverables if we do not have vsoe or third party evidence  or tpe  of selling price  and it eliminates the residual method and requires us to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
the besp is established considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  pricing practices  internal costs  geographies and gross margin 
the determination of besp is made through consultation with and formal approval by our pricing committee  taking into consideration the overall go to market pricing strategy 
we may modify or develop new go to market practices in the future 
as these go to market strategies evolve  we may modify our pricing practices in the future  which may result in changes in selling prices  impacting both vsoe and besp 
these factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multiple element arrangements from the current fiscal year  which may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for these elements but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement 
we frequently enter into sales arrangements with customers that contain multiple elements or deliverables such as hardware  software and services 
in order to comply with gaap  we have to make a number of reasoned judgments with respect to elements of these sales arrangements  including how to allocate the proceeds received from an arrangement  whether there are multiple elements in the arrangement  whether any undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition with respect to these arrangements 
during fiscal  we accounted for pre adoption multiple elements arrangements which have not subsequently been materially modified under the residual method and allocated arrangement consideration to each element based upon vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value of the respective elements 
vsoe of fair value for each element is based upon our historical standard rates charged for the product or service when such product or service is sold separately or based upon the price established by our management comprised pricing committee  which has the relevant authority when that product or service is not yet sold separately 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish vsoe of the fair value for those elements could affect the timing and the amount of revenue recognition 
revenue recognition also depends on all or a combination of the timing of shipment  completion of installation  customer acceptance and the readiness of customers facilities 
if shipments are not made on scheduled timelines  installation schedules are delayed or if the products are not accepted by the customer in a timely manner  our reported revenues may differ materially from expectations 
examples of the impact of these factors include the following 
if the shipment of one of our systems that sold for million was delayed  system revenue would be lowered by this million  
table of contents less any amounts deferred for service  training  or other future deliverables 
if one of our systems was sold for million and the sale involved multiple elements including training and service  a change in besp of the system could result in an approximately  impact to the amount of revenue allocated and recognized as product revenue rather than as service revenue 
business combinations and intangible asset impairment our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to business combinations is determined through established valuation techniques 
the allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets and appropriate discount rate for those cash flows 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identified intangible net assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or when impairment indicators are present 
we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist 
recoverability of purchased intangible assets with finite lives is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
impairment  if any  is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the impaired asset 
we review indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our purchased intangible assets are complex and subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
inventories the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as damaged inventory 
the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and adjust for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage rates and our estimates of product demand to support future sales and service 
if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce purchasing and manufacturing output accordingly  we could be required to write off inventory  which would negatively impact our gross margin 
for example  if the actual amount of inventory that is disposed of as obsolete  excess or damaged is larger or smaller than the amount that we estimated at june   then we would need to increase or decrease cost of sales by approximately million 
share based compensation expense we use the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the black scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
the most significant assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility and the expected term of the award 
our expected volatility is derived from the historical volatilities of several unrelated public companies within industries related to our business because we do not have sufficient trading history on our common stock 
when making the selections of our peer companies within 
table of contents industries related to our business to be used in the volatility calculation  we also considered the stage of development  size and financial leverage of potential comparable companies 
in addition  as our historical share option exercise experience as a publicly held entity does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term  we estimate the expected term of options granted by taking the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option  as illustrated by the simplified method 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
we recognize compensation cost for only those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period of the award 
we estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures and will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on recent forfeiture activity and expected future employee turnover 
quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported share based compensation expense  as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
if a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
if the estimated forfeiture rate was higher or lower by five percentage points  our share based compensation expense related to stock options would increase or decrease by approximately  respectively 
income taxes we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in our income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
we record adjustments based on filed returns when we have identified and finalized them  which is generally in the third quarter of the subsequent year for us federal and state provisions  respectively 
we have placed a full valuation allowance on all net us deferred tax assets because realization of these tax benefits through future taxable income cannot be reasonably assured 
we intend to maintain the valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowance 
any decision to reverse part or all of the valuation allowance would be based on our estimate of future profitability 
if our estimate were to be wrong we could be required to charge potentially significant amounts to income tax expense to establish a new valuation allowance 
our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided us taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states 
we plan foreign earnings remittance amounts based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and long term investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations 
material changes in our estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact our effective tax rate 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and certain foreign countries  and we are subject to corporate income tax audits in some of these jurisdictions 
we believe that our tax return positions are fully supported  but tax authorities are likely to challenge certain positions  which may not be fully sustained 
however  our income tax expense includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that result from these challenges 
determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments and recording the related assets and liabilities requires management judgments and estimates 
we evaluate our uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
we believe that our reserve for uncertain tax positions is adequate 
we review our reserves quarterly  and we may adjust such reserves because of proposed assessments by tax 
table of contents authorities  changes in facts and circumstances  issuance of new regulations or new case law  previously unavailable information obtained during the course of an examination  negotiations between tax authorities of different countries concerning our transfer prices  or the expiration of statutes of limitations 
loss contingencies as discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  in notes to consolidated financial statements  we are involved in various lawsuits  claims and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount 
we review these provisions at least quarterly and adjust these provisions to reflect the impact of negotiations  settlements  rulings  advice of legal counsel  and updated information 
currently  we do not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect our financial condition or operating results 
litigation is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties  some of which are beyond our control 
should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect  we could incur significant charges related to legal matters which could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
corporate bonus expense and accruals we record accruals for estimated corporate bonus expense which is paid out in the first quarter of the subsequent fiscal year 
our expense accruals for fiscal are based on our results for three factors net revenue  pre tax operating income loss and orders to backlog 
if we underestimate or overestimate any of these factors during a fiscal year  adjustments to bonus expense and accruals may be necessary in subsequent periods during the year 
for example  if our actual results as of the end of a fiscal year yielded a bonus attainment that varied by from our prior estimate  we would need to increase or decrease our bonus expense accrual in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year by approximately million 
item a 
quantitative qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions 
foreign currency exchange rate risk as of june   there were no amounts in deferred revenue for cyberknife and tomotherapy system contracts denominated in a foreign currency  in which system revenue would be recognized in future periods 
future fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may affect the price competitiveness of our products outside the united states 
for direct sales outside the united states  we will sell in both us dollars and local currencies  which could expose us to additional foreign currency risks  including changes in currency exchange rates 
our operating expenses in countries outside the united states  including some of our commissions related to sales of the cyberknife and tomotherapy systems  are payable in foreign currencies and therefore expose us to currency risk 
to the extent that management can predict the timing of payments under sales contracts or for operating expenses that are denominated in foreign currencies  we may engage in hedging transactions to mitigate such risks in the future 

table of contents interest rate risk at june   we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on interest income generated from our cash balances 
we believe that while the instruments we hold are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  and except as described below  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
however  should interest rates increase  the market value of our investments may decline 
this could result in a realized loss if we were forced to sell any of our investments before their scheduled maturity 
at the end of fiscal  we were not subject to significant levels of interest rate risk as a small amount of our cash was invested in money market funds
