table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth previously under the caption risk factors 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading developer and manufacturer of medical diagnostic imaging systems including solid state gamma cameras for nuclear cardiology and general nuclear medicine applications 
we also are one of the largest national providers of in office nuclear cardiology imaging and ultrasound services to physician practices  hospitals and imaging centers through our digirad imaging solutions dis business segment 
we designed and commercialized the first solid state nuclear gamma camera for the detection of cardiovascular disease and other medical conditions 
our imaging systems are sold in both portable and fixed configurations  and provide enhanced operability  improved patient comfort and  in the case of our triple headed cardius xpo system  shorter image acquisition time when compared to traditional vacuum tube cameras or our single or dual headed cameras 
our nuclear cameras fit easily into floor spaces as small as seven feet by eight feet and facilitate the delivery of nuclear medicine procedures in a physician s office  an outpatient hospital setting or within multiple departments of a hospital  eg  emergency and operating rooms 
we generate revenues within two primary operating segments dis our personnel and equipment leasing service business and our product segment 
through dis  we offer a comprehensive personnel and equipment leasing services program as an alternative to purchasing a gamma camera or ultrasound equipment for physicians who wish to perform nuclear imaging  echocardiography  vascular ultrasound  or any combination of these procedures in their offices by leasing the imaging system  certified personnel and other support required to perform imaging in the physician s office 
the flexibility of our products and our dis leasing service allows physicians more control over the diagnosis and treatment of their patients in their offices and to retain revenue from procedures they would otherwise refer elsewhere 
dis leasing services are primarily provided to cardiologists  internal medicine physicians and family practice doctors who enter into annual contracts for personnel and equipment services delivered on a per day basis 
our typical lease contracts provide service coverage ranging from once per month to five times per week 
we experience some seasonality in our dis business related to vacations  holidays and inclement weather 
we have been experiencing a significant market change due to the decline in reimbursements to our physicians and the uncertainty with healthcare legislation 
this market change may require further adjustments to our business model in order for our physician customers and us to maintain a viable economic model 
our product revenue results primarily from selling solid state gamma cameras and camera maintenance contracts 
we sell our imaging systems to physician offices  hospitals  and imaging centers primarily in the united states  although we have sold a small number of imaging systems internationally 
in order to address an industry need for an attenuation correction solution and as part of our product roadmap  we introduced a new product in called our cardius x act camera  which is a rapid cardiac spect vct imager 
the cardius x act camera is positioned more toward the hospital and larger cardiology practices 
in june  we expanded our product line further and introduced our new ergo general purpose portable imaging system  which is targeted to hospital customers 
our market the target market for our products and services is comprised of cardiologists  internal medicine physicians  family practice physicians  and hospitals in the united states that perform or could perform nuclear cardiac and ultrasound procedures 
as of december   we have provided imaging services through dis to more than 
table of contents  physicians and physician groups 
we have sold over cameras through our product segment 
more than half of our dis nuclear and ultrasound imaging customers are internal medicine physicians or other primary care practitioners  and the remainder are primarily cardiologists 
our market has been negatively affected  particularly in  by lower physician reimbursements from cms center for medicare and medicaid services and third party providers for the codes under which our physician customers bill for our services  pricing pressures  decreases in radiopharmaceutical isotope supplies and continuing efforts by some third party payers to reduce health care expenditures by requiring physicians to obtain specific accreditations or certifications 
we have been and will continue to address these market pressures by introducing new products  such as our cardius x act and ergo imaging systems and modifying our dis business model 
we anticipate introducing other new products and services in and beyond 
trends and drivers the medical device industry  including the market for nuclear and ultrasound imaging systems and services  is highly competitive 
our business continues to be affected by many factors  including generally declining healthcare reimbursement rates for cardiac imaging procedures although reimbursement for nuclear imaging increased in  it did not offset the declines in  competition from alternative imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography pet and computed tomography ct angiography  competition from other small owner operated mobile nuclear imaging providers  declining average selling prices for our product offerings and general uncertainty in the healthcare marketplace 
we expect most of these trends to continue in the foreseeable future 
in  we began to experience a decline in demand for our cameras  partially due to very limited hospital and physician group capital budgets  in addition to uncertainties related to upcoming changes in healthcare regulations and economic conditions 
this trend continued throughout and we believe will continue to some extent into our physician customers incurred a significant decrease in reimbursement on january  from cms and third party providers for the codes under which our physician customers bill for our services  which has impacted their businesses reduced the profitability of our services and our business reduced the number of days that we scanned and reduced the price that we charge for a day of service 
furthermore  the severe winter weather in the east and midwest reduced the number of scan days in the first quarter of and the worldwide medical radiopharmaceutical shortage reduced the number of scan days in the second and third quarters of also  the uncertainty over the enactment of future legislation that may impact reimbursement rates continues to linger and cause concern with our physician customers 
we are building and modifying our business model to adapt to environmental and regulatory changes in the healthcare marketplace 
in our product segment  we continue to build on past product segment achievements by introducing new products targeted specifically at the larger physician practices and hospital marketplace 
in  we received us food and drug administration fda k clearance for our new cardius x act imaging system 
also in  we introduced a new product called c pax  a complete on line fee per study cardiovascular information system  as a potential add on companion for any of our nuclear cameras or ultrasound equipment 
in  we introduced our new ergo general purpose portable imaging system  which is targeted to hospital customers 
the ergo system is designed to take images of the inside of a patient s body using radioactive isotopes 
the ergo system can be moved around the hospital so patients who cannot be taken to a nuclear medicine department can still be scanned 
it includes a detector with a inch by inch field of view  which is large enough to scan lungs and other organs larger than the heart 
it is our first nuclear imaging camera not exclusively focused on cardiology 
we believe our ergo imaging system will allow is to expand into new and growing market segments 
financial highlights our consolidated revenues were million for the year ended december   which represented a decrease of million  or  over the comparable prior year period primarily due to a decrease in revenue 
table of contents from our dis segment 
dis revenue decreased million  or  due to a reduction in our daily lease fee combined with a reduction in the number of days we were able to scan for our physician customers 
we reduced our daily lease fee to provide more incentive to our physician customers to continue using our services  since cms reduced reimbursement to the physicians for our imaging procedures 
our physician customers reduced the number of days they scanned their patients  in part due to the lack of availability of radiopharmaceutical supply during and the severe winter weather in the east and midwest in the first quarter of the worldwide shortage of radiopharmaceuticals ended in august as expected  as the main reactor of medical isotopes the chalk river reactor in canada came back on line 
additionally  product revenues for the year ended december  also decreased by million  or  compared to the prior year period  primarily due to a reduction in the number of cameras which were sold to cardiology practices and hospitals 
the number of cameras sold decreased to from during the year ended december  and  respectively 
we realized a loss from operations and a net loss for the year ended december  as a result of decreased dis segment gross profits  despite our efforts to reduce our operating expenses 
our consolidated net loss for the year ended december  was million  compared to net income of million during the same period in the prior year 
the decline in profitability in our dis segment was primarily attributable to a reduction in our daily lease fee  a reduction in the number of days that our physician customers scanned patients  combined with our commitment to maintain as many of our full time dedicated clinician employees who service our physician customers as possible 
the decline in profitability in our product segment was primarily attributable to unfavorable volume variances associated with the manufacturing of fewer cameras and an increase in our excess and obsolete inventory reserves 
our dis business currently operates in states 
for the year ended december   dis operated nuclear gamma cameras and ultrasound imaging systems  compared to nuclear gamma cameras and ultrasound imaging systems during the same period in the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to a decline in the number of days our customers needed our services and our desire to maximize utilization of our equipment 
we are seeking to improve our overall profitability through more efficient utilization of our fleet of gamma cameras and ultrasound equipment 
in some cases  we use cameras as back up cameras which reside at our various hub locations and are used when primary cameras are in need of repair  and in other cases  we sell or move our cameras to fixed site customer locations 
we measure efficiency by tracking system utilization  which is measured based on the percentage of days that our nuclear gamma cameras and ultrasound equipment are used to deliver services to customers out of the total number of days that they are available to deliver such services 
system utilization decreased to for the year ended december   compared to during the same period in the prior year  primarily due to fewer scan days as discussed above 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments  the most critical of which are those related to revenue recognition and inventory valuation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 
revenue recognition we derive revenues primarily from providing in office services to support the performance of cardiac imaging procedures and from selling and servicing solid state digital gamma cameras 
we recognize revenue in 
table of contents accordance with the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition  when all of the following four criteria are met i a contract or sales arrangement exists  ii products have been shipped and title has transferred or services have been rendered  iii the price of the products or services is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
the timing of revenue recognition is based upon factors such as passage of title and risk of loss  the need for installation  and customer acceptance 
these factors are based on the specific terms of each contract or sales arrangement 
dis revenue is derived from the leasing of personnel and equipment for in office nuclear and ultrasound imaging procedures 
revenue related to imaging services is recognized at the time services are performed and collection is reasonably assured 
dis services are generally billed on a per day basis under annual contracts for nuclear imaging  which specify the number of days of service to be provided  or on a flat rate month to month basis for nuclear imaging 
product revenues are generated from the sales of gamma cameras and follow on maintenance service contracts 
we generally recognize revenue upon delivery to customers 
the company also provides installation and training for camera sales in the united states 
installation and training is generally performed shortly after delivery and represents a cost which the company accrues at the time revenue is recognized 
neither service is essential to the functionality of the product 
maintenance services are sold beyond the term of the warranty  which is generally one year from the date of purchase 
revenue from these contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the obligation and is included in product sales 
reserves for doubtful accounts and billing adjustments we provide reserves for billing adjustments and doubtful accounts 
we review reserves on a quarterly basis and make adjustments based on our historical experience rate and known collectability issues and disputes 
we also consider our bad debt write off history 
our estimates of collectability could be impacted by material amounts due to changed circumstances  such as a higher number of defaults or material adverse changes in a payor s ability to meet its obligations 
within dis  we record adjustments and credit memos that represent billing adjustments within the first days subsequent to the performance of service 
a provision for billing adjustments is charged against dis revenues and a provision for doubtful accounts is charged to general and administrative expenses 
our risk of material loss is mitigated as we only have a small number of customer accounts in both dis and product that have receivable balances in excess of  inventory we state inventories at the lower of cost first in  first out or market net realizable value and review our inventory balances for excess and obsolete inventory levels on a quarterly basis 
costs include material  labor and manufacturing overhead and variance costs 
we rely on historical information to support our reserve and utilize management s business judgment 
we generally reserve of the cost of service inventory quantities in excess of a projected month demand 
we reserve of the cost of production inventory quantities in excess of a projected month demand 
once inventory is reserved  we do not adjust the reserve balance until the inventory is sold or disposed 
fair value of financial instruments the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements defines fair value for accounting purposes  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and provides disclosure requirements regarding fair value measurements 
the guidance defines fair value as an exit price  which is the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities generally correlates to the level of pricing observability 
assets and liabilities with readily available  actively quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability 
table of contents and require less judgment in measuring fair value 
conversely  assets and liabilities that are rarely traded or not quoted have less pricing observability and are generally measured at fair value using valuation models that require more judgment 
these valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment  the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency of the asset  liability or market and the nature of the asset or liability 
we have categorized our assets and liabilities measured at fair value into a three level hierarchy in accordance with this guidance 
see note for a further discussion regarding our measurement of assets and liabilities at fair value 
valuation of long lived assets including finite lived purchased intangible assets long lived assets consist of property and equipment and finite lived intangible assets 
we record property and equipment at cost  and record other intangible assets based on their fair values at the date of acquisition 
we calculate depreciation on property and equipment using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the assets 
we calculate amortization on other intangible assets using either the accelerated or the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the assets  based on the nature of when we expect to receive cash inflows generated by the intangible assets 
impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations are recorded when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
when indicators of impairment exist  we perform an annual review of the carrying value of our long lived assets to be held and used  including certain identifiable intangible assets  during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
no impairment losses were recorded on long lived assets during the years ended december  and we recorded an impairment loss of million related to patents and trademarks no longer utilized in currently marketed products during the year ended december  which was included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
valuation of goodwill on may   we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of ultrascan  inc ultrascan  a provider of ultrasound imaging systems and services to physicians offices and hospitals 
the acquisition of net assets from ultrascan resulted in the recording of goodwill  which represented the excess between the purchase price and the net assets acquired 
we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter  as well as when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we perform a two step impairment test on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit with goodwill to the carrying value of its long term assets 
if the carrying value of the long term assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test  whereby the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill is compared to its implied fair value 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss equal to the difference would be recorded 
in  we recorded a million impairment loss in part due to a significant decline in our market capitalization 
we determined that the implied fair value of goodwill is million utilizing the discounted cash flow method under the income approach as well as the market approach 
the impairment loss is included in the year ended december  loss from operations on our statement of operations 
no impairment losses were recorded on goodwill during the years ended december  and restructuring restructuring costs are included in loss from operations on our statement of operations 
restructuring loss for the year ended december  is comprised of one time termination benefits for involuntarily terminated 
table of contents employees  write offs of under utilized cameras and capital equipment and obligations pertaining to an abandoned property lease 
restructuring loss for the year ended december  is comprised of one time termination benefits for involuntarily terminated employees 
restructuring loss for the year ended december  is comprised of losses on the abandonment of property and equipment and assets held for sale  one time termination benefits for involuntarily terminated employees  and obligations pertaining to abandoned property leases 
losses on property and equipment were recorded consistent with the company s accounting policy related to long lived assets 
one time termination benefits are recorded at the time they are communicated to the affected employees 
losses on property lease obligations are recorded when the lease is abandoned 
share based payments we grant options to purchase our common stock and restricted stock units rsus to our employees and directors under our equity compensation plans 
we estimate the fair value of the stock option awards using the black scholes merton option pricing model on the date of grant 
the fair value of rsus is based on the stock price on the date of grant 
the fair value of equity instruments that are expected to vest are recognized using the straight line method over the requisite service period 
the fair value of stock options is derived using the following assumptions  some of which are subjective by nature 
the weighted average assumptions used in the black scholes merton model for the year ended december  were years for the expected term  for the expected volatility  for the risk free rate and for dividend yield 
the weighted average expected option term for   and reflects the application of the simplified method  which defines the life as the average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted average vesting period for all options 
we utilized this approach as our historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate an expected term 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of our stock 
we estimated the forfeiture rate based on historical data for forfeitures and we are recognizing compensation costs only for those equity awards expected to vest 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield in effect at the time of grant 
we have never declared or paid dividends and have no plans to do so in the foreseeable future 
warranty we generally provide a month warranty on our gamma cameras 
we accrue the estimated cost of this warranty at the time revenue is recorded and charge warranty expense to product cost of revenues 
warranty reserves are established based on historical experience with failure rates and repair costs and the number of systems covered by warranty 
warranty reserves are depleted as gamma cameras are repaired 
the costs consist principally of materials  personnel  overhead and transportation 
we review warranty reserves quarterly and  if necessary  make adjustments

table of contents comparison of years ended december  and revenues consolidated 
consolidated revenue was million for the year ended december   which represents a decrease of million  or  from the prior year period  primarily as a result of a reduction in our daily lease fee  a reduction in the number of days we were able to scan for our physician customers and extremely limited isotope supply in our dis business segment combined with lower camera sales in our product business segment 
dis revenue accounted for of total revenues for the year ended december   compared to for prior year period 
we expect dis revenue to continue to represent the larger percentage of our consolidated revenue 
dis 
our dis revenue was million for the year ended december   which represents a decrease of million  or  from the prior year period 
the decrease resulted from our decision to reduce our daily lease rate at the end of the first quarter of to our physician customers in response to the anticipated decline in cms and third party reimbursements for nuclear imaging services  along with a decrease in patient service days during the periods where supplies of radiopharmaceuticals were not available or available in short supply during product 
our product revenue was million for the year ended december   which represents a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year period 
we believe that economic factors  including the uncertainty in the credit market and a slowing economy and continued healthcare imaging reimbursement pressures resulted in decreased gamma camera sales 
cost of revenue and gross profit consolidated 
consolidated gross profit was million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year period 
the decrease in consolidated gross profit is primarily the result of the decline in dis and product revenues  our commitment to maintain as many of our full time dedicated clinician employees as possible  the resulting impact of lower camera sales on our standard cost variances as well as an increase in excess and obsolete inventory reserves compared to the prior year period 
consolidated gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to for the year ended december  from for the prior year period 
dis 
cost of dis revenue was million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of million  or  from the prior year period  primarily due to decreased labor costs  decreased radiopharmaceutical expenses from fewer scans  and a reduction in depreciation costs due to more cameras in being fully depreciated compared to the prior year period 
dis gross profit was million for the year ended december   which represents a decrease of million  or as compared to the prior year period 
dis gross profit as a percentage of dis revenue decreased to for the year ended december  from for the prior year period 
the decline in operational performance is primarily associated with the reduction in service days  combined with some impact from the isotope shortage 
product 
cost of product revenues was million for the year ended december   representing an increase of million  or  over the prior year period 
product gross profit decreased to million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year period 
product gross profit as a percentage of product revenue decreased to for the year ended december  from for the prior year period primarily due to higher manufacturing variances from lower production volumes as well as an increase in excess and obsolete inventory reserves 
operating expenses research and development 
we continue to invest in research and development with a focus on innovation as we seek to improve our existing technology 
in and  we received us food and drug 
table of contents administration k clearance for our new cardius x act imaging system and our new ergo general purpose portable imaging system  respectively 
research and development expenses were milion for the year ended december   representing a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year period  primarily as a result of research and development clinical evaluation efforts for our cardius x act imaging system  which did not reoccur in research and development expenses were and of product revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we plan to continue investing in our technology platform to penetrate new and existing market segments and attract new customers 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses were million for the year ended december   which represents a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year period  primarily as a result of lower personnel costs 
marketing and sales expenses have remained consistent as a percent of revenues at and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   which are consistent with the prior year period 
general and administrative expenses were of total revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year period 
the increase in percentage of revenue was primarily due to the decline in dis revenues 
restructuring loss restructuring costs were million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
we initiated and substantially completed restructuring plans in the second quarter of and second and third quarters of during and  we experienced changing market conditions  which contributed to operating losses within our dis and product segments  including declines in reimbursements to our physician customers  worldwide isotope shortages and regulatory uncertainty in the healthcare system 
in response  we reduced our workforce within both the dis and product segments in order to realign expenses to a lower level of sales 
we also eliminated and consolidated certain dis hub locations in order to focus on hubs that have stronger anticipated margin and growth potential 
other income other income consists primarily of interest income  net of interest paid and other associated expenses 
the decrease in other income of million is attributable to a decrease in interest rates and a slight decrease in our average cash balance 
comparison of years ended december  and revenues consolidated 
consolidated revenue was million during the year ended december   which represents a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year period  as a result of lower dis and product revenues 
dis revenue accounted for approximately of total revenues for the year ended december   compared to approximately for the year ended december  we expect dis revenue to continue to represent the larger percentage of our consolidated revenue in future periods 
dis 
our dis revenue was million for the year ended december   which represents a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year period 
the decrease resulted from the sale or closure of underperforming locations in connection with the restructuring plan initiated in the fourth quarter of  partially offset by revenue increases from our current locations 
product 
our product revenue was million for the year ended december   which represents a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year period 
this decrease in revenue was primarily 
table of contents due to a decrease in the number of gamma cameras sold during the year ended december  to cameras compared to cameras sold in the prior year period and the lowering of average sales prices as our product sales mix was represented by a larger percentage of refurbished cameras 
the decrease in revenue was partially offset by an increase in maintenance contract revenues to million for the year ended december  from million in the prior year period due to the expansion of our installed base of gamma cameras 
we believe that the decrease in gamma camera sales and the demand for refurbished cameras was due to the slowing economy  the reduction in available credit for potential buyers  lower levels of available capital budgets and the continued downward pressure on healthcare imaging reimbursement rates 
to offset continued pricing pressures and declines in the in office nuclear imaging marketplace  we introduced our new cardius x act camera in  which we believe is positioned to move us more toward the hospital marketplace 
gross profit consolidated 
consolidated gross profit was million for the year ended december   which was essentially unchanged in comparison to the prior year period  as the increased gross profits at our dis segment were offset by a decrease in gross profits at our product segment 
the increase in gross profit at our dis segment were due to the realignment of this segment initiated in the fourth quarter of  increased utilization of our dis assets and reduced personnel costs and other efficiency and cost improvements 
the decrease in product segment gross profit is principally the result of fewer camera sales  offset slightly by an increase in product maintenance contract gross profit 
consolidated gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  dis 
cost of dis revenue consists primarily of labor  radiopharmaceuticals  equipment depreciation  and other costs associated with the provision of services 
cost of dis revenue was million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year period 
the decrease in cost of dis revenue is primarily a result of decreased labor  radiopharmaceutical  and depreciation costs predominantly attributed to the increased utilization of our personnel and assets 
dis gross profit was million for the year ended december   which represents an increase of million  or  from the prior year period 
dis gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to for the year ended december  from for the prior year period 
the improvement in operational performance is primarily associated with the realignment of the segment  which included the sale or closure of underperforming locations and a focus on selling within certain geographical areas  along with improved asset utilization 
product 
cost of product revenue primarily consists of materials  labor and overhead costs associated with the manufacturing and warranty of our products 
cost of revenues for the product segment was million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year period as fewer gamma cameras were sold and as our product sales mix was represented by a larger percentage of refurbished cameras 
product gross profit was million for the year ended december   representing a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year period 
product gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to for the year ended december  from for the prior year period  primarily due to the sale of proportionately higher margin refurbished cameras and a decrease in personnel and manufacturing overhead costs as a result of our cost reduction initiatives 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses are the costs associated with the design  development and enhancement of our products  and consist of salaries  developmental materials  facility and overhead costs  consulting fees  and non recurring engineering costs 
we continue to invest in research and development with a focus on innovation as we seek to improve our existing technology 
in march  we received us food and drug administration k clearance for our new cardius x act imaging system 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   which represents an increase of million  or  compared to the prior year period 
the increase in research and 
table of contents development expenses was primarily attributable to higher personnel and development costs  as well as certain clinical evaluation costs related to our new cardius x act imaging system 
research and development expenses were of product revenue for the year ended december  compared to in the prior year period  due to the lower camera sales and increased product development activity in marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  bonuses  travel  marketing  collateral materials and tradeshow costs 
marketing and sales expenses were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to the prior year period  principally as a result of lower personnel costs 
marketing and sales expenses were of total revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year period 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for accounting  human resources  information technology and executive personnel  legal related costs  professional fees  outside services  insurance  and costs related to our board of directors 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or compared to the prior year period  principally as a result of lower personnel costs 
general and administrative expenses were of total revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year period 
restructuring loss 
restructuring loss declined from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  to improve company profitability  we initiated restructuring plans in the third quarter of and in the fourth quarter of in  we reduced our workforce within both the product and dis segments in order to realign manufacturing and overhead expenses to a lower level of camera sales and to flatten the management structure 
to this end  the majority of the restructuring loss incurred for the year ended december  consisted of severance expense 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated plans to sell  close  and consolidate certain dis hub locations during the first quarter of in order to focus on hub locations that have stronger anticipated margin and growth potential 
these sales and closures involved the sale or abandonment of property and equipment and staff reductions at the hub locations impacted by the restructuring plans 
the majority of the restructuring loss incurred for the year ended december  consisted of a million loss on property and equipment 
goodwill impairment loss 
the acquisition of net assets from ultrascan in may resulted in the recording of goodwill 
among other assets  goodwill was recorded within a reporting unit in our dis segment on the date of the acquisition  and represented the excess between the purchase price and the net assets acquired 
during our annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of  we determined that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the assets held by the reporting unit  which resulted in a goodwill impairment loss of million 
no impairment losses were recorded for the year ended december  other income other income consists primarily of interest income  net of interest paid and other associated expenses 
the decrease in other income of million is attributable to a decrease in interest rates 

table of contents quarterly financial data unaudited the following financial information reflects all normal recurring adjustments  which are  in the opinion of management  necessary for a fair statement of the results of the interim periods 
summarized quarterly data for fiscal and are as follows in thousands  except per share data st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter fiscal revenues gross profit loss from operations net loss net loss per common share basic and diluted fiscal revenues gross profit income loss from operations net income loss net income loss per common share basic and diluted earnings per share are computed independently for each of the quarters presented 
therefore  the sum of the quarterly net earnings per share will not necessarily equal the total for the year 
liquidity and capital resources general we require capital principally for capital expenditures and to finance accounts receivable and inventory  which we manage very closely 
our working capital requirements vary from period to period depending on manufacturing volumes  the timing of deliveries and the payment cycles of our customers 
our capital expenditures consist primarily of nuclear cameras  ultrasound machines  vans  manufacturing and development equipment and computer hardware and software 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale of million 
we currently invest our cash reserves in money market funds  us treasury and corporate debt securities 
based upon our current level of expenditures  we believe our working capital  together with cash flows from operating activities  will be adequate to meet our anticipated cash requirements for capital expenditures and working capital for at least the next months 
cash flows the following table shows cash flow information for the three years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the prior year period 
this decrease was primarily attributable to decreased net income partially offset by changes in working capital

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the value of debt securities in our investment portfolio 
our risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investments in interest rate sensitive financial instruments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we attempt to increase the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities

changes in interest rates over time will increase or decrease our interest income
