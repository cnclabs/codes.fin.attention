increases in fdic insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on our earnings 
the fdic maintains the dif to resolve the cost of bank failures 
the dif is funded by fees assessed on insured depository institutions  including firstmerit bank 
in november  the fdic issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to substantially modify the manner by which fee assessments are determined  including changing the deposit insurance assessment base from total domestic deposits to average total assets minus average tangible equity  as required by the dodd frank act 
final rules regarding proposed changes to the manner and method of dif fee assessments are expected to be effective april  we cannot provide any assurance as to the effect of any proposed change in dif assessment rate  should such a change occur  as such changes are dependent upon a variety of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
increases in dif assessment rates may materially adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common shares at the current rate or at all 
additional information regarding the fdic s proposed changes to dif assessment rates is provided in item business  in the section captioned regulation and supervision deposit insurance 
impending changes to rules relating to debit card interchange fees may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
pursuant to section of the dodd frank act the durbin interchange amendment  the federal reserve board has been granted the authority to issue rules relating to debit card interchange fees  network exclusivity and transaction routing 
specifically  the durbin interchange amendment directs the federal reserve board to establish standards for assessing whether the amount of any interchange fee that an issuer receives or charges with respect to a debit card transaction is reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction 
the durbin interchange amendment directs the federal reserve board to consider  when prescribing regulations  the functional similarity between debit card transactions and check transactions and to distinguish between the incremental cost incurred by the issuer for the issuer s role in the authorization  clearance  and settlement of a particular debit transaction  which shall be considered in setting the standard  and other costs incurred by an issuer that are not specific to a particular debit transaction  which shall not be considered in setting the standard 
as an issuer of debit cards and receiver of interchange fees  our revenue on interchange fees may decrease as a result of the level of fees the federal reserve deems reasonable and proportional which it establishes regulation standards on the amount of interchange fees that can be charged 
on december   the federal reserve board approved release of draft rules for comment pertaining to the durbin interchange amendment and final rules are expected to be 
table of contents published in april  and taking effect in july  we have estimated that our revenues may decrease by million in after these new rules take effect 
the recent repeal of federal prohibitions on payment of interest on demand deposits could increase our interest expense 
all federal prohibitions on the ability of financial institutions to pay interest on demand deposit accounts were repealed as part of the dodd frank act 
as a result  beginning on july   financial institutions could commence offering interest on demand deposits to compete for clients 
we do not yet know what interest rates other institutions may offer 
our interest expense will increase and our net interest margin will decrease if we begin offering interest on demand deposits to attract new customers or maintain current customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
our business strategy includes significant growth plans 
our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively 
during  we undertook three significant acquisitions  which established a chicago footprint consisting of branch locations 
we intend to continue pursuing a profitable growth strategy both within our existing markets and in new markets 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in significant growth stages of development 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to expand our market presence in our existing markets or successfully enter new markets or that any such expansion will not adversely affect our results of operations  even if only on a short term basis 
failure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business  future prospects  financial condition or results of operations and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy 
also  if we grow more slowly than anticipated or fail to successfully integrate newly acquired operations  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
our ability to grow successfully will depend on a variety of factors  including the continued availability of desirable business opportunities  the competitive responses from other financial institutions in our market areas and our ability to integrate acquisitions and manage our growth 
while we believe we have the management resources and internal systems in place to successfully manage future growth  there can be no assurance that growth opportunities will be available or  if available  that growth will be successfully managed 
we may experience difficulties in integrating acquired assets and expanding our operations into new geographic areas and markets 
the market areas in chicago  illinois served by the assets and branches we acquired during are areas in which we previously did not conduct significant banking activities 
our ability to compete effectively in these new markets will depend on our ability to understand the local market and competitive dynamics and identify and retain key employees who know these markets 
we may also encounter obstacles when incorporating the acquired operations with our operations and management 
we face risks with respect to future expansion 
we may acquire other financial institutions or parts of those institutions in the future and we may engage in de novo branch expansion 
we may also consider and enter into new lines of business or offer new products or services 
acquisitions and mergers involve a number of expenses and risks  including the time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and merger targets  the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit  operations  management and market risks with respect to the target institution may not be accurate  the time and costs of evaluating new markets  hiring experienced local management and opening new offices  and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion  
table of contents our ability to finance an acquisition and possible dilution to our existing shareholders  the diversion of our management s attention to the negotiation of a transaction  and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combining businesses  entry into new markets  the introduction of new products and services into our business  the incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and possible adverse short term effects on our results of operations  and the risk of loss of key employees and customers 
we may incur substantial costs to expand  and we can give no assurance such expansion will result in the levels of profits we seek 
there can be no assurance that integration efforts for any future mergers or acquisitions will be successful 
also  we may issue equity securities in connection with future acquisitions  which could cause ownership and economic dilution to our current shareholders 
there is no assurance that  following any future mergers or acquisitions  our integration efforts will be successful or that  after giving effect to the acquisition  we will achieve profits comparable to or better than our historical experience 
we face significant competition for loans and deposits 
we face significant competition for loans and deposits from other banks and financial institutions  both within and beyond our local marketplace 
within our region  we compete with commercial banks  savings banks  credit unions  and investment banks for deposits  and with the same financial institutions and others including mortgage brokers  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  and brokerage houses for loans 
we also compete with companies that solicit loans and deposits over the internet 
many of our competitors including money center  national  and superregional banks have substantially greater resources and higher lending limits than we do  and may offer certain products and services that we do not offer 
because our profitability stems largely from our ability to attract deposits and originate loans  our continued ability to compete for depositors and borrowers is critical to our success 
our success as a competitor depends on a number of factors  including  but not limited to i our ability to develop  maintain  and build upon long term relationships with our customers by providing them with convenience  in the form of multiple branch locations and extended hours of service  ii access  in the form of alternative delivery channels  such as online banking  banking by phone  and atms  iii a broad and diverse selection of products and services  iv interest rates and service fees that compare favorably with those of our competitors  and v skilled and knowledgeable personnel to assist our customers with their financial needs 
external factors that may impact our ability to compete include changes in local economic conditions and real estate values  changes in interest rates and the consolidation of banks and thrifts within our marketplace 
we are subject to certain risks with respect to liquidity 
liquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support our operations and to fulfill our obligations  including commitments to originate loans  to repay our wholesale borrowings and other liabilities and to satisfy the withdrawal of deposits by our customers 
our primary source of liquidity is our core deposit base  which is raised through our retail branch system 
core deposits comprised approximately of total deposits at december  additional available unused wholesale sources of liquidity include advances from the federal home loan bank of cincinnati  issuances through dealers in the capital markets and access to certificates of deposit issued through brokers 
liquidity is further provided by unencumbered  or unpledged  investment securities that totaled billion at december  an inability to raise funds through deposits  borrowings  the sale or pledging as collateral of loans and other assets could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general 
factors that could negatively affect our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market 
table of contents downturn or negative regulatory action against us 
our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us  such as severe disruption of the financial markets or negative news and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole  as evidenced by recent turmoil in the domestic and worldwide credit markets 
we depend upon the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties 
in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties  we may rely on information provided to us by customers and counterparties  including financial statements and other financial information 
we may also rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and  with respect to financial statements  on reports of independent auditors 
for example  in deciding whether to extend credit to a business  we may assume that the customer s audited financial statements conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and present fairly  in all material respects  the financial condition  results of operations and cash flows of the customer 
we may also rely on the audit report covering those financial statements 
our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent we rely on financial statements that do not comply with generally accepted accounting principles or that are materially misleading  or on other financial information that is inaccurate or incomplete 
derivative transactions may expose us to unexpected risk and potential losses 
we are party to a number of derivative transactions 
many of these derivative instruments are individually negotiated and non standardized  which can make exiting  transferring or settling the position difficult 
we carry borrowings which contain embedded derivatives 
these borrowing arrangements require that we deliver underlying securities to the counterparty as collateral 
if market interest rates were to decline  we may be required to deliver more securities to the counterparty 
we are dependent on the creditworthiness of the counterparties and are therefore susceptible to credit and operational risk in these situations 
derivative contracts and other transactions entered into with third parties are not always confirmed by the counterparties on a timely basis 
while the transaction remains unconfirmed  we are subject to heightened credit and operational risk and  in the event of a default  may find it more difficult to enforce the contract 
in addition  as new and more complex derivative products are created  covering a wider array of underlying credit and other instruments  disputes about the terms of the underlying contracts could arise  which could impair our ability to effectively manage our risk exposures from these products and subject us to increased costs 
any regulatory effort to create an exchange or trading platform for credit derivatives and other over the counter derivative contracts  or a market shift toward standardized derivatives  could reduce the risk associated with such transactions  but under certain circumstances could also limit our ability to develop derivatives that best suit the needs of our clients and ourselves and adversely affect our profitability 
in addition  comprehensive regulation of the over the counter derivatives market to be implemented under the dodd frank act may adversely affect our treatment of these transactions 
we are subject to examinations and challenges by tax authorities 
in the normal course of business  we  as well as our subsidiaries  are routinely subject to examinations from federal and state tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due in connection with investments we have made and the businesses in which we have engaged 
recently  federal and state tax authorities have become increasingly aggressive in challenging tax positions taken by financial institutions 
these tax positions may relate to tax compliance  sales and use  franchise  gross receipts  payroll  property and income tax issues  including tax base  apportionment and tax credit planning 
the challenges made by tax authorities may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions 
if any such challenges are made and are not resolved in our favor  they could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents loss of key employees may disrupt relationships with certain customers 
our business is primarily relationship driven in that many of our key employees have extensive customer relationships 
loss of a key employee with such customer relationships may lead to the loss of business if the customers were to follow that employee to a competitor 
while we believe our relationship with our key producers is good  we cannot guarantee that all of our key personnel will remain with our organization 
loss of such key personnel  should they enter into an employment relationship with one of our competitors  could result in the loss of some of our customers 
impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets could require charges to earnings  which could result in a negative impact on our results of operations 
under current accounting standards  goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indeterminate lives are no longer amortized but  instead  are assessed for impairment periodically or when impairment indicators are present 
assessment of goodwill and such other intangible assets could result in circumstances where the applicable intangible asset is deemed to be impaired for accounting purposes 
under such circumstances  the intangible asset s impairment would be reflected as a charge to earnings in the period during which such impairment is identified 
we may be exposed to liability under non solicitation agreements to which one or more of our employees may be a party to with certain of our competitors 
from time to time  we may hire employees who may be parties to non solicitation or non competition agreements with one or more of our competitors 
although we expect that all such employees will comply with the terms of their non solicitation agreements  it is possible that if customers of our competitors choose to move their business to us  or employees of our competitor seek employment with us  even without any action on the part of any employee bound by any such agreement  that one or more of our competitors may choose to bring a claim against us and our employee 
unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or customer information  whether through a breach of our computer systems or otherwise  could severely harm our business 
as part of our business we collect  process  and retain sensitive and confidential client and customer information 
despite the security measures we have in place  our facilities and systems  and those of our third party service providers  may be vulnerable to security breaches  acts of vandalism  computer viruses  misplaced or lost data  programming and or human errors  or other similar events 
any security breach involving the misappropriation  loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer information  whether by us or by our vendors  could severely damage our reputation  expose us to the risks of litigation and liability  disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may elect or be compelled to seek additional capital in the future  but that capital may not be available when it is needed 
we are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations 
as we experience loan losses  additional capital may need to be infused 
in addition  we may elect to raise additional capital to support our business or to finance acquisitions  if any  or we may otherwise elect or be required to raise additional capital 
our ability to raise additional capital will depend on our financial performance  conditions in the capital markets  economic conditions and a number of other factors  many of which are outside our control 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we can raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us 
if we cannot raise additional capital when needed  it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
the primary source of our income from which we pay dividends is the receipt of dividends from firstmerit bank  which is subject to regulatory restrictions on its payment of dividends 
the availability of dividends from firstmerit bank is limited by various statutes and regulations 
it is possible  depending upon the financial condition of firstmerit bank and other factors  that the occ could assert that payment of dividends or other payments is an unsafe or unsound practice 
in addition  the payment of dividends by other 
table of contents subsidiaries is also subject to the laws of the subsidiary s state of incorporation 
our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors 
in the event that firstmerit bank was unable to pay dividends to us  we in turn would likely have to reduce or stop paying dividends on our common shares 
our failure to pay dividends on our common shares could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common shares 
additional information regarding dividend restrictions is provided in item business in the section captioned regulation and supervision dividends and transactions with affiliates 
our organizational documents  state laws and regulated industry may discourage a third party from acquiring us by means of a tender offer  proxy contest or otherwise 
certain provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated code of regulations  certain laws of the state of ohio  and certain aspects of the bhca and other governing statutes and regulations  may have the effect of discouraging a tender offer or other takeover attempt not previously approved by our board of directors 
consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions 
technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks at one or both ends of the transaction 
for example  consumers can now pay bills and transfer funds directly without banks 
the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries  known as disintermediation  could result in the loss of fee income  as well as the loss of customer deposits and income generated from those deposits 
our business may be adversely impacted by acts of war or terrorism 
acts of war or terrorism could have a significant adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business 
such events could affect the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans  could impair the value of the collateral securing our loans  and could cause significant property damage  thus increasing our expenses and or reducing our revenues 
in addition  such events could affect the ability of our depositors to maintain their deposits 
although we have established disaster recovery policies and procedures  the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to certain risks in connection with our use of technology 
communications and information systems are essential to the conduct of our business  as we use such systems to manage our customer relationships  our general ledger  our deposits  and our loans 
while we have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures  interruptions  and security breaches  there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or that they will be adequately addressed if they do 
in addition  any compromise of our security systems could deter customers from using our web site and our online banking service  both of which involve the transmission of confidential information 
although we rely on commonly used security and processing systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of data  these precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of security 
in addition  we outsource certain of our data processing to certain third party providers 
if our third party providers encounter difficulties  or if we have difficulty in communicating with them  our ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions could be affected  and our business operations could be adversely impacted 
threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel 
the occurrence of any systems failure  interruption  or breach of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business  could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or could expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability 
any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  the provision of financial products and services has become increasingly technology driven 
our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively  and in a cost efficient manner  is dependent on our ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available 
many of our competitors have greater resources to invest in technology than we do and may be better equipped to market new 
table of contents technology driven products and services 
the ability to keep pace with technological change is important  and the failure to do so on our part could have a material adverse impact on our business and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to the legal and regulatory environment our earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies 
the policies of the federal reserve board impact us significantly 
the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states 
its policies directly and indirectly influence the rate of interest earned on loans and paid on borrowings and interest bearing deposits and can also affect the value of financial instruments we hold 
such policies determine to a significant extent our cost of funds for lending and investing 
changes in federal reserve board policies are beyond our control and are difficult to predict 
federal reserve board policies can also affect our borrowers  potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans 
for example  a tightening of the money supply by the federal reserve board could reduce the demand for a borrower s products and services 
this could adversely affect the borrower s earnings and ability to repay its loan  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the enactment of new legislation and increased regulatory oversight may significantly affect our financial condition 
the financial services industry is extensively regulated 
firstmerit bank is subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by the occ and the fdic 
as a holding company  we also are subject to regulation and oversight by the federal reserve board 
federal and state regulation of financial institutions is designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers  and not to benefit our shareholders 
such regulations can at times impose significant limitations on our operations 
regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities  including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution  the classification of assets by the institution and the adequacy of an institution s allowance for loan losses 
proposals to change the laws governing financial institutions are frequently raised in congress and before bank regulatory authorities  as evidenced by the enactment of the dodd frank act in substantial regulatory and legislation initiatives  including a comprehensive overhaul of the financial regulatory system in the united states  could materially affect our business  and the nature and scope of future major changes and their effects are impossible to determine 
moreover  it is impossible to predict the ultimate form newly proposed legislation might take or how it might affect us 
the recently enacted dodd frank act may adversely impact our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
on july   the dodd frank act was signed into law 
the dodd frank act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the united states 
there are a number of reform provisions that are likely to significantly impact the ways in which banks and bank holding companies  including us and firstmerit bank  do business 
for example  the dodd frank act changes the assessment base for federal deposit insurance premiums by modifying the deposit insurance assessment base calculation to equal a depository institution s consolidated assets less tangible capital and permanently increases the standard maximum amount of deposit insurance per customer to  and non interest bearing transaction accounts will have unlimited deposit insurance through january  the dodd frank act creates the consumer financial protection bureau as a new agency empowered to promulgate new and revise existing consumer protection regulations which may limit certain consumer fees or otherwise significantly change fee practices 
the dodd frank act also imposes more stringent capital requirements on bank holding companies by  among other things  imposing leverage ratios on bank holding companies and prohibiting new trust preferred issuances from counting as tier i capital 
the dodd frank act also repeals the federal prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposits  thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts 
other significant changes from provisions of the dodd frank act include  but are not limited to i changes to rules relating to debit card interchange fees  ii new comprehensive regulation of the over the counter derivatives market  iii reform related to the regulation of credit rating agencies  iv restrictions on the ability 
table of contents of banks to sponsor or invest in private equity or hedge funds  and v the implementation of a number of new corporate governance provisions  including  but not limited to  requiring companies to claw back incentive compensation under certain circumstances  providing shareholders the opportunity to cast a non binding vote on executive compensation  new executive compensation disclosure requirements and considerations regarding the independence of compensation advisors 
many provisions of the dodd frank act will not be implemented immediately and will require interpretation and rule making by federal regulators 
we are closely monitoring all relevant sections of the dodd frank act to ensure continued compliance with laws and regulations 
while the ultimate effect of the dodd frank act on us cannot currently be determined  the law and its implementing rules and regulations are likely to result in increased compliance costs and fees paid to regulators  along with possible restrictions on our operations  all of which may have a material adverse affect on our operating results and financial condition 
our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity may be adversely impacted by issues arising in foreclosure practices  including delays in the foreclosure process  related to certain industry deficiencies  as well as potential losses in connection with actual or projected repurchases and indemnification payments related to mortgages sold into the secondary market 
recent announcements of deficiencies in foreclosure documentation by several large seller servicer financial institutions have raised various concerns relating to mortgage foreclosure practices in the united states 
a group of state attorneys general and state bank and mortgage regulators in all states and the district of columbia is currently reviewing foreclosure practices and a number of mortgage sellers servicers have temporarily suspended foreclosure proceedings in some or all states in which they do business in order to evaluate their foreclosure practices and underlying documentation 
the integrity of the foreclosure process is important to our business  as an originator and servicer of residential mortgages 
as a result of our continued focus of concentrating our lending efforts in our primary markets in ohio  illinois and pennsylvania  as well as servicing loans for the federal national mortgage association fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac  we do not anticipate suspending any of its foreclosure activities 
during the third quarter of  we reviewed our foreclosure procedures and concluded they are generally conservative in nature and do not present the significant documentation deficiencies underlying other industry foreclosure problems 
nevertheless  we could face delays and challenges in the foreclosure process arising from claims relating to industry practices generally  which could adversely affect recoveries and our financial results  whether through increased expenses of litigation and property maintenance  deteriorating values of underlying mortgaged properties or unsuccessful litigation results generally 
in addition  in connection with the origination and sale of residential mortgages into the secondary market  we make certain representations and warranties  which  if breached  may require us to repurchase such loans  substitute other loans or indemnify the purchasers of such loans for actual losses incurred in respect of such loans 
although we believe that our mortgage documentation and procedures have been appropriate and are generally conservative in nature  it is possible that we will receive repurchase requests in the future and we may not be able to reach favorable settlements with respect to such requests 
it is therefore possible that we may increase our reserves or may sustain losses associated with such loan repurchases and indemnification payments 
environmental liability associated with commercial lending could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property 
during the ordinary course of business  we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans 
in doing so  there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties 
if hazardous or toxic substances are found  we may be liable for remediation costs  as well as for personal injury and property damage 
in addition  we own and operate certain properties that may be subject to similar environmental liability risks 
environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property 
in addition  future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental 
table of contents liability 
although we have policies and procedures requiring the performance of an environmental site assessment before initiating any foreclosure action on real property  these assessments may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards 
the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we have been and will continue to be the subject of litigation which could result in legal liability and damage to our business and reputation 
from time to time  we may be subject to claims or legal action from customers  employees and or others 
financial institutions like firstmerit are facing a growing number of significant class actions  including those based on the manner of calculation of interest on loans and the assessment of overdraft fees 
past  present and future litigation have included or could include claims for substantial compensatory and or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages 
we are also involved from time to time in other reviews  investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and self regulatory agencies regarding our business 
these matters also could result in adverse judgments  settlements  fines  penalties  injunctions or other relief 
like other large financial institutions  we are also subject to risk from potential employee misconduct  including non compliance with policies and improper use or disclosure of confidential information 
substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations and or cause significant reputational harm to our business 
additional information regarding litigation is included in note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements and in item legal proceedings

table of contents item legal proceedings 
in the normal course of business  firstmerit and its subsidiaries are at all times subject to pending and threatened legal actions  some for which the relief or damages sought are substantial 
although firstmerit is not able to predict the outcome of such actions  after reviewing pending and threatened actions with counsel  management believes that based on the information currently available the outcome of such actions  individually or in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or stockholders equity of the corporation 
however  it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters  if unfavorable  may be material to the results of operations in a particular future period as the time and amount of any resolution of such actions and its relationship to the future results of operations are not known 
reserves are established for legal claims only when losses associated with the claims are judged to be probable  and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
in many lawsuits and arbitrations  including almost all of the class action lawsuits  it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to estimate the ultimate or minimum amount of that liability until the case is close to resolution  in which case a reserve will not be recognized until that time 
overdraft litigation commencing in december  two separate lawsuits were filed in the summit county court of common pleas and the lake county court of common plea against firstmerit corporation and its subsidiary firstmerit bank  na 
the complaints were brought as putative class actions on behalf of ohio residents who maintained a checking account at firstmerit bank and who incurred one or more overdraft fees as a result of the alleged re sequencing of debit transactions 
the complaints seek actual damages  disgorgement of overdraft fees  punitive damages  interest  injunctive relief and attorney fees 
interest litigation in august a lawsuit was filed in the cuyahoga county court of common pleas against firstmerit bank  na the breach of contract complaint was brought as a putative class action on behalf of ohio commercial borrowers who had allegedly had the interest they owed calculated improperly by using the method 
the complaint seeks actual damages  interest  injunctive relief and attorney fees 
schneider litigation commencing in may  two lawsuits were filed in the cuyahoga county court of common pleas against firstmerit bank  na one complaint was filed by the receiver for firstmerit bank customers alan and joanne schneider  and the other complaint was filed by alleged defrauded investors of the schneiders seeking to represent a class of persons who invested in promissory notes offered by the schneiders 
the allegations against firstmerit bank arise out of alan schneider s business checking account at firstmerit bank into which investors checks were deposited and from which certain investors received payments 
the complaints seek  among other things  actual damages  treble damages  punitive damages  interest  rescission and attorney fees 
on january   a third party complaint was filed by firstmerit bank against its insurers in the receiver s lawsuit 
by opinion dated february  the cuyahoga county court of appeals reversed the trial court s decision certifying an investor class in the case brought by the alleged defrauded investors 
based on information currently available  consultation with counsel  available insurance coverage and established reserves  management believes that the eventual outcome of all claims against the corporation and its subsidiaries will not  individually or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
however  it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters  if unfavorable  may be material to the results of operations for a particular period

table of contents results of operations net interest income net interest income  the corporation s principal source of earnings  is the difference between interest income generated by earning assets primarily loans and investment securities and interest paid on interest bearing funds namely customer deposits and wholesale borrowings 
net interest income is affected by market interest rates on both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the level of earning assets being funded by interest bearing liabilities  noninterest bearing liabilities  the mix of funding between interest bearing liabilities  noninterest bearing liabilities and equity  and the growth in earning assets 
net interest income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for year ended december  and million for the year ended december  for the purpose of this remaining discussion  net interest income is presented on a fte basis  to provide a comparison among all types of interest earning assets 
that is  interest on tax free securities and tax exempt loans has been restated as if such interest were taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of adjusted for the non deductible portion of interest expense incurred to acquire the tax free assets 
net interest income presented on a fte basis is a financial measure that is calculated and presented other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap and is widely used by financial services organizations 
therefore  management believes these measures provide useful information for both management and investors by allowing them to make peer comparisons

the first bank  george washington and midwest acquisitions were considered business combinations whereby all acquired assets and liabilities were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition and identifiable intangible assets were recorded at their estimated fair value 
estimated fair values are considered preliminary and are subject to change up to one year after the acquisition date 
this allows for adjustments to the initial purchase entries if additional information relative to closing date fair values becomes available  and the corporation continues to analyze its estimates of the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
material adjustments to acquisition date estimated fair values are recorded in the period in which the acquisition occurred and  as a result  previously reported results are subject to change

held to maturity securities totaled million at december  compared to million at december  and consist principally of securities issued by state and political subdivisions 
other investments totaled million at december  compared to million at december  and consisted primarily of include federal home loan bank fhlb and federal reserve bank frb stock

net unrealized gains were million at december   compared to million at december  the corporation conducts a regular assessment of its investment securities to determine whether any securities are other than temporarily impaired 
only the credit portion of other than temporary impairment otti is recognized in current earnings for those securities where there is no intent to sell or it is more likely than not the corporation would not be required to sell the security prior to expected recovery 
the remaining portion of otti is to be included in accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of income tax 
gross unrealized losses of million as of december   compared to million at december  were concentrated within trust preferred securities held in the investment portfolio 
the corporation holds eight  single issuer  trust preferred securities 
such investments are less than of the fair value of the entire investment portfolio 
none of the bank issuers have deferred paying dividends on their issued trust preferred shares in which the corporation is invested 
the fair values of these investments have been impacted by market conditions which have caused risk premiums to increase resulting in the decline in the fair value of the corporation s trust preferred securities 
further detail of the composition of the securities portfolio and discussion of the results of the most recent otti assessment are in note investment securities to the consolidated financial statements 
loans loans acquired under loss share agreements with the fdic loss share agreements include the amounts of expected reimbursements from the fdic under these agreements and are presented as covered loans below 
loans not subject to loss share agreements are presented below as noncovered loans 
acquired loans are initially measured at fair value as of the acquisition date 
fair value measurements include estimates related to expected prepayments and the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal  interest and other cash flows 
credit discounts representing the principal losses expected over the life of the loan are also a component of the initial fair value  therefore  an allowance for loan losses is not recorded at the acquisition date 
total noncovered loans 
table of contents outstanding at year end increased million or to billion compared to billion one year ago 
this increase was driven primarily by higher commercial loans which increased in due to the corporation s expansion into the chicago  illinois area resulting in million of new commercial loan production 
this growth was also attributable to increases in asset based lending as well as new business within the capital markets and healthcare lines of business 
while the corporation is adding new commercial loans in both its core ohio and newer chicago  illinois markets  low credit line utilization by existing customers is mitigating new loan production with respect to the overall portfolio balances 
single family mortgage loans are originated by firstmerit bank and then sold into the secondary mortgage market or held in portfolio 
low interest rates during resulted in an increase in mortgage loan originations and refinancings  however  due to the continuing downturn in the housing market there was an overall decrease of in balances retained in portfolio 
outstanding home equity loan balances decreased million or from and installment loans decreased million or reflecting the on going economic downturn 
credit card loans were down million or from the following table breaks down outstanding loans by category

acquired loans are considered impaired if there is evidence of credit deterioration since origination and if it is probable all contractually required payments will not be collected 
expected cash flows at the purchase date in excess of the fair value of acquired impaired loans are recorded as interest income over the life of the loans if the timing and amount of the future cash flows is reasonably estimable 
subsequent to the purchase date  increases in cash flows over those expected at the purchase date are recognized as interest income prospectively 
the present value of any decreases in expected cash flows after the purchase date is recognized as a provision for loans losses net of any expected reimbursement under any loss share agreements 
revolving loans  including lines of credit and credit cards loans  and leases are excluded from acquired impaired loan accounting 
a loss share receivable is recorded at the acquisition date which represents the estimated fair value of reimbursement the corporation expects to receive under any loss share agreements 
the fair value measurement reflects counterparty credit risk and other uncertainties 
the loss share receivable continues to be 
table of contents measured on the same basis as the related indemnified loans 
deterioration in the credit quality of the loans recorded as an adjustment to the allowance for covered loan losses would immediately increase the basis of the loss share receivable  with the offset recorded through the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income 
increases in the credit quality or cash flows of loans reflected as an adjustment to yield and accreted into income over the remaining life of the loans decrease the basis of the loss share receivable  with such decrease being accreted into income over the same period or the life of the loss share agreements  whichever is shorter 
loss assumptions used in the basis of the loss share receivable are consistent with the loss assumptions used to measure the related covered loans 
all loans acquired in the first bank acquisition were performing as of the date of acquisition and  therefore  the difference between the fair value and the outstanding balance of these loans is being accreted to interest income over the remaining term of the loans 
the bank acquired million and billion of loans in conjunction with the fdic assisted acquisitions of george washington and midwest  respectively 
all loans acquired in the george washington and midwest acquisitions were acquired under loss share agreements 
the corporation has elected to account for all loans acquired in the george washington and midwest acquisitions as impaired loans under asc acquired impaired loans except for million of acquired loans with revolving privileges  which are outside the scope of this guidance  and which are being accounted for in accordance with asc acquired non impaired loans 
interest income  through accretion of the difference between the carrying amount of the acquired impaired loans and the expected cash flows  is recognized on all acquired impaired loans 
the difference between the fair value of the acquired non impaired loans and their outstanding balances is being accreted to interest income over the remaining period the revolving lines are in effect

the corporation and firstmerit bank regularly analyze the adequacy of their allowance through ongoing review of trends in risk ratings  delinquencies  nonperforming assets  charge offs  economic conditions  and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio 
notes summary of significant accounting policies and loans and 
table of contents allowance for loan losses to the consolidated financial statements provide detailed information regarding the corporation s credit policies and practices 
the corporation uses a vendor based loss migration model to forecast losses for commercial loans 
the model creates loss estimates using twelve month monthly rolling vintages and calculates cumulative three years loss rates within two different scenarios 
one scenario uses five year historical performance data while the other one uses two year historical data 
the calculated rate is the average cumulative expected loss of the two and five year data set 
as a result  this approach lends more weight to the more recent performance 
management also considers internal and external factors such as economic conditions  loan management practices  portfolio monitoring  and other risks  collectively known as qualitative factors or q factors  to estimate credit losses in the loan portfolio 
q factors are used to reflect changes in the portfolio s collectability characteristics not captured by historical loss data 
acquired loans are recorded at acquisition date at their acquisition date fair values  and  therefore  are excluded from the calculation of loan loss reserves as of the acquisition date 
to the extent there is a decrease in the present value of cash flows from acquired impaired loans after the date of acquisition  the corporation records an allowance for loan losses  net of expected reimbursement under any loss share agreements 
these expected reimbursements are recorded as part of covered loans in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
during the year ended december   the corporation increased its allowance for covered loan losses to million to reserve for estimated additional losses on certain acquired impaired loans 
the increase in the allowance was recorded by a charge to the provision for covered loan losses of million and an increase of million in the loss share receivable for the portion of the losses recoverable under the loss share agreements 
for acquired loans that are not deemed impaired at acquisition  credit discounts representing the principal losses expected over the life of the loan are a component of the initial fair value 
subsequent to the purchase date  the methods utilized to estimate the required allowance for loan losses for these loans is similar to originated loans  however  the corporation records a provision for loan losses only when the required allowance  net of any expected reimbursement under any loss share agreements  exceeds any remaining credit discounts 
the corporation did not recognize a provision for loan losses on any acquired non impaired loans in the year ended december  at december  the allowance for loan losses was million or of loans outstanding  compared to million or at year end the allowance equaled of nonperforming loans at year end compared to at year end during additional reserves were established to address identified risks associated with the slowdown in the housing markets and the decline in residential and commercial real estate values 
these reserves totaled million at year end and million at year end the increase in the additional allocation augmented the increase in the calculated loss migration analysis as the loans were downgraded during nonperforming assets have increased by million over primarily attributable to the declining economic conditions

the corporation s objective is to minimize losses from its commercial lending activities and to maintain consumer losses at acceptable levels that are stable and consistent with growth and profitability objectives 
nonperforming loans are defined as follows nonaccrual loans on which interest is no longer accrued because its collection is doubtful 
restructured loans on which  due to deterioration in the borrower s financial condition  the original terms have been modified in favor of the borrower or either principal or interest has been forgiven 
nonperforming assets are defined as follows nonaccrual loans on which interest is no longer accrued because its collection is doubtful

in most cases the modification is either a concessionary reduction in interest rate  extension of the maturity date or modification of the adjustable rate provisions of the loan that would otherwise not be considered 
concessionary modifications are classified as troubled debt restructurings tdrs unless the modification is short term  or does not include any provision other than extension of maturity date 
tdrs accrue interest if the borrower complies with the revised terms and conditions and has demonstrated repayment performance at a level commensurate with the modified terms over several payment cycles

capital adequacy capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance 
the corporation maintained a strong capital position with tangible common equity to assets of at december   compared with at december  financial institutions are subject to a strict uniform system of capital based regulations 
under this system  there are five different categories of capitalization  with prompt corrective actions and significant operational restrictions imposed on institutions that are capital deficient under the categories 
the five categories are well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
to be considered well capitalized an institution must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier capital ratio of at least  a leverage capital ratio of at least  and must not be subject to any order or directive requiring the institution to improve its capital level 
an adequately capitalized institution has a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier i capital ratio of at least and a leverage capital ratio of at least 
institutions with lower capital levels are deemed to be undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized  depending on their actual capital levels 
the appropriate federal regulatory agency may also downgrade an institution to the next lower capital category upon a determination that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound practice 
institutions are required to monitor closely their capital levels and to notify their appropriate regulatory agency of any basis for a change in capital category

risk management market risk management market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices and commodity prices  including the correlation among these factors and their volatility 
when the value of an instrument is tied to such external factors  the holder faces market risk 
the corporation is primarily exposed to interest rate risk as a result of offering a wide array of financial products to its customers 
interest rate risk management changes in market interest rates may result in changes in the fair market value of the corporation s financial instruments  cash flows  and net interest income 
the corporation seeks to achieve consistent growth in net interest income and capital while managing volatility arising from shifts in market interest rates 
the asset and liability committee alco oversees market risk management  establishing risk measures  limits  and policy guidelines for managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital 
according to these policies  responsibility for measuring and the management of interest rate risk resides in the corporate treasury function 
interest rate risk on the corporation s balance sheets consists of reprice  option  and basis risks 
reprice risk results from differences in the maturity  or repricing  of asset and liability portfolios 
option risk arises from embedded options present in the investment portfolio and in many financial instruments such as loan prepayment options  deposit early withdrawal options  and interest rate options 
these options allow customers opportunities to benefit when market interest rates change  which typically results in higher costs or lower revenue for the corporation 

table of contents basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates or indices  which subsequently result in a narrowing of profit spread on an earning asset or liability 
basis risk is also present in administered rate liabilities  such as interest bearing checking accounts  savings accounts and money market accounts where historical pricing relationships to market rates may change due to the level or directional change in market interest rates 
the interest rate risk position is measured and monitored using risk management tools  including earnings simulation modeling and economic value of equity sensitivity analysis  which capture both near term and long term interest rate risk exposures 
combining the results from these separate risk measurement processes allows a reasonably comprehensive view of short term and long term interest rate risk in the corporation 
net interest income simulation analysis 
earnings simulation involves forecasting net interest earnings under a variety of scenarios including changes in the level of interest rates  the shape of the yield curve  and spreads between market interest rates 
the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates is measured using numerous interest rate scenarios including shocks  gradual ramps  curve flattening  curve steepening as well as forecasts of likely interest rates scenarios 
presented below is the corporation s interest rate risk profile as of december  and immediate change in rates and resulting percentage increase decrease in net interest income basis basis basis basis points points points points december  december  modeling for the decrease in basis points scenario has been suspended due to the current rate environment 
modeling the sensitivity of net interest earnings to changes in market interest rates is highly dependent on numerous assumptions incorporated into the modeling process 
to the extent that actual performance is different than what was assumed  actual net interest earnings sensitivity may be different than projected 
the assumptions used in the models are management s best estimate based on studies conducted by the alco department 
the alco department uses a data warehouse to study interest rate risk at a transactional level and uses various ad hoc reports to refine assumptions continuously 
assumptions and methodologies regarding administered rate liabilities eg  savings  money market and interest bearing checking accounts  balance trends  and repricing relationships reflect management s best estimate of expected behavior and these assumptions are reviewed regularly 
economic value of equity modeling 
the corporation also has longer term interest rate risk exposure  which may not be appropriately measured by earnings sensitivity analysis 
alco uses economic value of equity eve sensitivity analysis to study the impact of long term cash flows on earnings and capital 
eve involves discounting present values of all cash flows of on balance sheet and off balance sheet items under different interest rate scenarios 
the discounted present value of all cash flows represents the corporation s economic value of equity 
the analysis requires modifying the expected cash flows in each interest rate scenario  which will impact the discounted present value 
the amount of base case measurement and its sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve allow management to measure longer term repricing and option risk in the balance sheet 
presented below is the corporation s eve profile as of december  and immediate change in rates and resulting percentage increase decrease in eve basis basis basis basis points points points points december  december  modeling for the decrease in basis points scenario has been suspended due to the current rate environment 
management reviews and takes appropriate action if this analysis indicates that the corporation s eve will change by more than in response to an immediate basis point increase in interest rates or eve will change by 
table of contents more than in response to an immediate basis point increase or decrease in interest rates 
the corporation is operating within these guidelines 
interest rate sensitivity analysis 
the corporation analyzes the historical sensitivity of its interest bearing transaction accounts to determine the portion that it classifies as interest rate sensitive versus the portion classified over one year 
the following analysis divides interest bearing assets and liabilities into maturity categories and measures the gap between maturing assets and liabilities in each category 
the analysis shows that assets maturing within one year exceed liabilities maturing within the same period by billion 
focusing on estimated repricing activity within one year  the corporation was in an asset sensitive position at december  as illustrated in the following table 
over days days days days days year total in thousands interest earning assets loans and leases investment securities and federal funds sold total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities demand interest bearing savings and money market accounts certificate and other time deposits securities sold under agreements to repurchase wholesale borrowings total interest bearing liabilities total gap cumulative gap management of interest rate exposure 
management uses the results of its various simulation analyses to formulate strategies to achieve desired risk profile within the parameters of the corporation s capital and liquidity guidelines 
specifically  management actively manages interest rate risk positions by using derivatives predominately in the form of interest rate swaps  which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities 
for more information about how the corporation uses interest rate swaps to manage its balance sheet  see note summary of significant accounting policies and note derivatives and hedging activities to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity risk management liquidity risk is the possibility of the corporation being unable to meet current and future financial obligations as they come due at a reasonable cost 
liquidity is managed to ensure stable  reliable and cost effective sources of funds to satisfy demand for credit  deposit withdrawals and investment opportunities 
the corporation considers core earnings  strong capital ratios and credit quality essential for maintaining high credit ratings  which allow the corporation cost effective access to market based liquidity 
the corporation relies on a large  stable core deposit base and a diversified base of wholesale funding sources to manage liquidity risk 
the treasury group is responsible for identifying  measuring and monitoring the corporation s liquidity profile 
the position is evaluated daily  weekly and monthly by analyzing the composition of all funding sources  reviewing projected liquidity commitments by future months and identifying sources and uses of funds 
liquidity measures are reported monthly to alco and the board of directors in accordance with policies approved by the board of directors 
the treasury group also prepares a contingency funding plan that assesses liquidity needs that may arise from certain stress events 
furthermore  the company utilizes a cash flow measurement approach to liquidity management and models the demand and supply for funds under multiple stress scenarios 
the net result is then compared with the contingent sources for funds  which can also be altered via the model  to ensure sufficient funds are available 
the 
table of contents overall management of the corporation s liquidity position is then integrated into retail deposit pricing policies to ensure a stable core deposit base 
the corporation s primary source of liquidity is its core deposit base  raised through its retail branch system 
core deposits comprised approximately of total deposits at december  the corporation also has available unused wholesale sources of liquidity  including advances from the fhlb of cincinnati  issuance through dealers in the capital markets and access to certificates of deposit issued through brokers 
liquidity is further provided by unencumbered  or unpledged  investment securities that totaled billion at december  the corporation s liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect circumstances 
an example of a direct event would be a downgrade in the corporation s public credit rating by a rating agency due to factors such as deterioration in asset quality  a large charge to earnings  a decline in profitability or other financial measures  or a significant merger or acquisition 
examples of indirect events unrelated to the corporation that could have an effect on its access to liquidity would be terrorism or war  natural disasters  political events  or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation  mutual fund or hedge fund 
similarly  market speculation or rumors about the corporation or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources 
the corporation s liquidity contingency plan outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis 
the plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions 
it also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for effectively managing liquidity through a problem period 
parent company liquidity the corporation manages its liquidity principally through dividends from firstmerit bank 
the corporation has sufficient liquidity to service its debt  support customary corporate operations and activities including acquisitions at a reasonable cost  in a timely manner and without adverse consequences  as well as pay dividends to shareholders 
during the year ended december   firstmerit bank paid million in dividends to firstmerit 
as of december   firstmerit bank had an additional million available to pay dividends without regulatory approval 
any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors  subject to applicable limitations under federal and ohio law  and will be dependent upon our results of operations  financial condition  contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors

recent market and regulatory developments 
in response to the national and international economic recession  and in efforts to stabilize and strengthen the financial markets and banking industries  the united states congress and governmental agencies have taken a number of significant actions over the past several years  including the passage of legislation and implementation of a number of programs 
the most recent of these actions was the passage into law  on july   of the dodd frank act 
the dodd frank act is the most comprehensive change to banking laws and the financial regulatory environment since the great depression of the s 
the dodd frank act affects almost every aspect of the nation s financial services industry and mandates change in several key areas  including regulation and compliance both with respect to financial institutions and systematically important nonbank financial companies  securities regulation  executive compensation  regulation of derivatives  corporate governance  and consumer protection 
in this respect  it is noteworthy that preemptive rights heretofore granted to national banking associations by the occ under the national bank act will be diminished with respect to consumer financial laws and regulations 
thus  congress has authorized states to enact their own substantive protections and to allow state attorneys general to initiate civil actions to enforce federal consumer protections 
in this respect  the corporation will be subject to regulation by the new consumer financial protection bureau under the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
the bureau will consolidate enforcement currently undertaken by myriad financial regulatory agencies  and will have substantial power to define the rights of consumers and responsibilities of providers  including the corporation 

table of contents in addition  among many other legislative changes that the corporation will assess  the corporation will experience a new assessment model from the fdic based on assets  not deposits  be subject to enhanced executive compensation and corporate governance requirements  and be able  for the first time to offer interest on business transaction and other accounts 
the extent to which the dodd frank act and initiatives thereunder will succeed in addressing the credit markets or otherwise result in an improvement in the national economy is not yet known 
in addition  because most aspects of this legislation will be subject to intensive agency rulemaking and subsequent public comment prior to implementation over the next six to months  it is difficult to predict at this time the ultimate effect of the dodd frank act on the corporation 
it is likely  however  that the corporation s expenses will increase as a result of the new compliance requirements 
various legislation affecting financial institutions and the financial industry will likely continue to be introduced in congress  and such legislation may further change banking statutes and the operating environment of the corporation and its subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways  and could increase or decrease the cost of doing business  limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance depending on whether any of this potential legislation will be enacted  and if enacted  the effect that it or any implementing regulations  would have n the financial condition or results of operations of the corporation or any of its subsidiaries 
with the enactment of the dodd frank act  arra and eesa  the nature and extent of future legislative and regulatory changes affecting financial institutions remain very unpredictable at this time 
to the extent that the previous information describes statutory and regulatory provisions applicable to the corporation or its subsidiaries  it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of those provisions or agreement 
also  such statutes  regulations and policies are continually under review by congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies and are subject to change at any time  particularly in the current economic and regulatory environment 
any such change in statutes  regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the corporation could have a material effect on the business of the corporation

contractual obligations  commitments  contingent liabilities  and off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations the corporation has various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in its consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes the corporation s significant obligations at december  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash

accounting standards require that the liability be recorded at net present value while the future payments contained in this table have not been discounted 
critical accounting policies the corporation s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap and follow general practices within the financial services industry in which it operates 
all accounting policies are important  and all policies described in note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements provide a greater understanding of how the corporation s financial performance is recorded and reported 
some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a significant effect on the corporation s financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility 
the policies require management to exercise judgment and make certain assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements 
these assumptions and estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
management relies heavily on the use of judgment  assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions  including accounting for the allowance for loan losses  income taxes  derivative instruments and hedging activities  and assets and liabilities that involve valuation methodologies 
a brief discussion of each of these areas follows 
acquired loans 
loans acquired are initially recorded at their acquisition date fair values 
the carryover of an allowance for loan losses is prohibited as any credit losses in the loans are included in the determination of the fair value of the loans at the acquisition date 
fair values for acquired loans are based on a discounted cash flow methodology that involves assumptions and judgments as to credit risk  interest rate risk  prepayment risk  liquidity risk  default rates  loss severity  payment speeds  collateral values and discount rate 
acquired loans are evaluated for impairment and are considered impaired if there is evidence of credit deterioration since origination and if it is probable that not all contractually required payments will be collected 
in the assessment of credit quality  numerous assumptions  interpretations and judgments must be made  based on internal and third party credit quality information and ultimately the determination as to the probability that all contractual cash flows will not be able to be collected 
this is a point in time assessment and inherently subjective due to the nature of the available information and judgment involved 
expected cash flows at the purchase date in excess of the fair value of acquired impaired loans are recorded as interest income over the life of the loans if the timing and amount of the future cash flows is reasonably estimable 
subsequent to the purchase date  increases in cash flows over those expected at the purchase date are recognized as interest income prospectively 
the present value of any decreases in expected cash flows after the purchase date is recognized as a provision for loans losses net of expected reimbursement under any loss share agreements 
revolving 
table of contents loans  including lines of credit and credit cards loans  and leases are excluded from acquired impaired loan accounting 
for acquired loans that are not deemed impaired at acquisition  credit discounts representing the principal losses expected over the life of the loan are a component of the initial fair value 
subsequent to the purchase date  the methods utilized to estimate the required allowance for loan losses for these loans is similar to originated loans  however  the corporation records a provision for loan losses only when the required allowance  net of expected reimbursement under any loss share agreements exceeds any remaining credit discounts 
a loss share receivable is recorded at the acquisition date which represents the estimated fair value of reimbursement the corporation expects to receive from the fdic for incurred losses on certain covered loans 
the fair value measurement reflects counterparty credit risk and other uncertainties 
the loss share receivable continues to be measured on the same basis as the related indemnified loans 
deterioration in the credit quality of the loans recorded as an adjustment to the allowance for covered loan losses would immediately increase the basis of the loss share receivable  with the offset recorded through the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income 
increases in the credit quality or cash flows of loans reflected as an adjustment to yield and accreted into income over the remaining life of the loans decrease the basis of the loss share receivable  with such decrease being accreted into income over the same period or the life of the loss share agreements  whichever is shorter 
loss assumptions used in the basis of the loss share receivable are consistent with the loss assumptions used to measure the related covered loans 
due to the accounting requirements of acquired loans  certain trends and credit statistics may be impacted if such loans are included 
the corporation believes that excluding the acquired loans from the presentation of such statistics is more meaningful and representative of its ongoing operations and credit quality 
allowance for loan losses 
as explained in note summary of significant accounting policies and note loans and allowance for loan losses to the consolidated financial statements  the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management estimates credit losses based on individual loans determined to be impaired and on all other loans grouped based on similar risk characteristics 
this estimate is based on the current economy s impact on the timing and expected amounts of future cash flows on impaired loans as well as historical loss experience associated with homogeneous pools of loans 
management also considers internal and external factors such as economic conditions  loan management practices  portfolio monitoring  and other risks  collectively known as qualitative factors or q factors  to estimate credit losses in the loan portfolio 
management s estimate of the allowance for the commercial portfolio could be affected by risk rating upgrades or downgrades as a result of fluctuations in the general economy  developments within a particular industry  or changes in an individual credit due to factors particular to that credit such as competition  management or business performance 
a reasonably possible scenario would be an estimated migration of lower risk related pass credits to criticized status which could increase the inherent losses by million 
for the consumer portfolio  where individual products are reviewed on a group basis or in loan pools  losses can be affected by such things as collateral value  loss severity  the economy  and other uncontrollable factors 
the consumer portfolio is largely comprised of loans that are secured by primary residences and home equity lines and loans 
a basis point increase in the estimated loss rates on the residential mortgage and home equity line and loan portfolios would increase the inherent losses by million 
the remaining consumer portfolio inherent loss analysis includes reasonably possible scenarios with estimated loss rates increasing by basis points  which would change the related inherent losses by million 
additionally the estimate of the allowance for loan losses for the entire portfolio may change due to modifications in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding and general economic conditions as evidenced by changes in interest rates  unemployment rates  bankruptcy filings  used car prices and real estate values 
while no one factor is dominant  each has the ability to result in actual loan losses which differ from originally estimated amounts 
the information presented above demonstrates the sensitivity of the allowance to key assumptions 
this sensitivity analysis does not reflect an expected outcome 

table of contents income taxes 
management evaluates and assesses the relative risks and appropriate tax treatment of transactions after considering statutes  regulations  judicial precedent and other information and maintains tax accruals consistent with its evaluation of these relative risks 
changes to the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates  interpretations of tax laws  the status of examinations being conducted by taxing authorities and changes to statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance that impact the relative risks of tax positions 
these changes  when they occur  can affect deferred taxes and accrued taxes as well as the current period s income tax expense and can be material to the corporation s operating results for any particular reporting period 
note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements provides an analysis of the corporation s income taxes 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in various aspects of its business  the corporation uses derivative financial instruments to modify exposures to changes in interest rates and market prices for other financial instruments 
derivative instruments are required to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in the fair value recorded directly in earnings 
to qualify for and maintain hedge accounting  the corporation must meet formal documentation and effectiveness evaluation requirements both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis 
the application of the hedge accounting policy requires strict adherence to documentation and effectiveness testing requirements  judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness  identification of similar hedged item groupings  and measurement of changes in the fair value of hedged items 
if in the future derivative financial instruments used by the corporation no longer qualify for hedge accounting  the impact on the consolidated results of operations and reported earnings could be significant 
when hedge accounting is discontinued  the corporation would continue to carry the derivative on the balance sheet at its fair value  however  for a cash flow derivative  changes in its fair value would be recorded in earnings instead of through other comprehensive income  and for a fair value derivative  the changes in fair value of the hedged asset or liability would no longer be recorded through earnings 
see also note summary of significant accounting policies and note derivative and hedging activities to the consolidated financial statements 
valuation measurements 
valuation methodologies often involve a significant degree of judgment  particularly when there are no observable active markets for the items being valued 
investment securities  residential mortgage loans held for sale and derivatives are carried at fair value  which requires key judgments affecting how fair value for such assets and liabilities is determined 
in addition  the outcomes of valuations have a direct bearing on the carrying amounts of goodwill  mortgage servicing rights  and pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
to determine the values of these assets and liabilities  as well as the extent to which related assets may be impaired  management makes assumptions and estimates related to discount rates  asset returns  prepayment rates and other factors 
the use of different discount rates or other valuation assumptions could produce significantly different results  which could affect the corporation s results of operations 
fair value measurement the corporation uses fair value measurements to record certain assets and liabilities at fair value and determine fair value disclosures 
additional information regarding fair value measurement is included in note fair value measurement to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill goodwill arising from business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired 
the corporation is required to evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the corporation has elected to test for goodwill impairment as of november th of each year 
the valuation and testing methodologies used in the corporation s analysis of goodwill impairment are summarized in note summary of significant accounting policies under the heading goodwill and intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements 
the first step in testing for goodwill impairment is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
the corporation s reporting units for purposes of this testing are its major lines of business  commercial  retail and wealth 
fair values of reporting units are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis derived from internal earnings forecasts 
the primary assumptions management uses include earnings forecasts for five years  terminal 
table of contents values based on future growth rates  and discount rates that reflect the range of the corporation s market capitalization and a control premium 
management believes that the estimates and assumptions used in the goodwill impairment analysis for its reporting units are reasonable  however  if actual results and market conditions differ from the assumptions or estimates used  the fair value of each reporting unit could change in the future 
the second step of impairment testing is necessary only if the carrying amount of either reporting unit exceeds its fair value  suggesting goodwill impairment 
in such a case  the corporation would estimate a hypothetical purchase price for the reporting unit representing the unit s fair value and then compare that hypothetical purchase price with the fair value of the unit s net assets excluding goodwill 
any excess of the estimated purchase price over the fair value of the reporting unit s net assets represents the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized as a charge to earnings if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
based on the corporation s analysis performed in the fourth quarter  the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount 
mortgage servicing rights when the corporation sells mortgage loans in the secondary market  it may retain the right to service the loans sold in exchange for a servicing fee that is collected over the life of the loan as the payments are received from the borrower 
such amounts are initially capitalized as mortgage servicing rights on the consolidated balance sheets at current fair value 
mortgage servicing rights are remeasured at each subsequent reporting date using the amortization method 
under the amortization method  mortgage servicing rights are amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated net servicing income 
amortization is recorded in loan sales and servicing income 
at each reporting period  mortgage servicing rights are assessed for impairment based on fair value of those rights 
the fair value of mortgage servicing rights typically rises as market interest rates increase and declines as market interest rates decrease  however  the extent to which this occurs depends in part on the magnitude of changes in market interest rates  and the differential between the then current market interest rates for mortgage loans and the mortgage interest rates included in the mortgage servicing portfolio 
since sales of mortgage servicing rights tend to occur in private transactions and the precise terms and conditions of the sales are typically not readily available  there is a limited market to refer to in determining the fair value of mortgage servicing rights 
as such  like other participants in the mortgage banking business  the corporation determines the fair value by estimating the present value of the asset s future cash flows utilizing market based prepayment rates  discount rates  and other assumptions 
the corporation utilizes a third party vendor to perform the modeling to estimate the fair value of its mortgage servicing rights 
the corporation reviews the estimated fair values and assumptions used by the third party in the model on a quarterly basis 
the corporation also compares the estimates of fair value and assumptions to recent market activity and against its own experience 
additional information pertaining to the accounting for mortgage servicing rights is included in note mortgage servicing rights and mortgage servicing activity to the consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement benefits the corporation sponsors several qualified and nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans for certain of its employees 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
key factors include assumptions about the expected rates of return on plan assets  discount rates  and health care cost trend rates  as determined by the corporation  within certain guidelines 
the corporation considers market conditions  including changes in investment returns and interest rates  in making these assumptions 
the corporation s pension administrative committee committee has developed a statement of investment policies and objectives statement to assist firstmerit and the investment managers of the pension plan in effectively supervising and managing the assets of the pension plan 
the investment philosophy contained in the statement sets the investment time horizon as long term and the risk tolerance level as slightly above average while requiring diversification among several asset classes and securities 
without sacrificing returns  or increasing risk  the statement recommends a limited number of investment manager relationships and permits both separate accounts and commingled investments vehicles 
based on the demographics  actuarial funding situation  business and financial 
table of contents characteristics and risk preference  the statement defines that the pension fund as a total return investor return and accordingly current income is not a key goal of the plan 
the pension asset allocation policy has set guidelines based on the plan s objectives  characteristics of the pension liabilities  industry practices  the current market environment  and practical investment issues 
the committee has decided to investment in traditional ie  publicly traded securities and not alternative asset classes eg  private equity  hedge funds  real estate  etc 
at this time 
assumed discount rates reflect the time value of money as of the measurement date in determining the present value of future cash outflows for pension and postretirement benefit payments 
the objective of setting a discount rate is to establish an obligation for postretirement benefits equivalent to an amount that  if invested in high quality fixed income securities  would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the pension and postretirement benefits when due 
assumed discount rates are reevaluated at each measurement date 
if the general level of interest rates rises or declines  the assumed discount rates will change in a similar manner 
the method used to estimate the discount rate can be changed if facts and circumstances indicate that a different method would result in a better estimate of the discount rate 
as of december  cash flows specific to each plan along with the hewitt top quartile yield curve hewitt yield curve were used by the corporation as the basis for estimating the discount rate 
the hewitt yield curve provides the best estimate of cash flows from investment in high quality fixed income securities to be used to pay the corporation s pension and postretirement benefits when due 
the primary assumptions used in determining the corporation s pension and postretirement benefit obligations and related expenses are presented in note benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements 
the actuarial assumptions used by the corporation may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
while the corporation believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions might materially affect the corporation s financial position or results of operations 
forward looking statements safe harbor statement information in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section within this annual report on form k  which is not historical or factual in nature  and which relates to expectations for future shifts in loan portfolio to consumer and commercial loans  increase in core deposits base  allowance for loan losses  demands for the corporation s services and products  future services and products to be offered  increased numbers of customers  and like items  constitute forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
the following factors are among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements general economic conditions  including their impact on capital expenditures  business conditions in the banking industry  the regulatory environment  rapidly changing technology and evolving banking industry standards  competitive factors  including increased competition with regional and national financial institutions  new service and product offerings by competitors and price pressures  and like items
