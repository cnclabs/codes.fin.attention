item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading  less than truckload ltl  non union motor carrier providing regional  inter regional and national ltl service and value added logistics services from a single integrated organization 
in addition to our core ltl services  we offer our customers a broad range of logistics services including ground and air expedited transportation  supply chain consulting  transportation management  truckload brokerage  container delivery and warehousing services 
through marketing and carrier relationships  we also offer door to door international freight services to and from all of north america  central america  south america and the far east 
more than of our revenue has historically been derived from transporting ltl shipments for our customers  whose demand for our services is generally tied to industrial production and the overall health of the us domestic economy 

table of contents in analyzing the components of our revenue  we monitor changes and trends in the following key metrics revenue per hundredweight this measurement reflects our pricing policies  which are influenced by competitive market conditions and our growth objectives 
generally  freight is rated by a class system  which is established by the national motor freight traffic association  inc light  bulky freight typically has a higher class and is priced at higher revenue per hundredweight than dense  heavy freight 
changes in the class  packaging of the freight and length of haul of the shipment can also affect this average 
fuel surcharges  accessorial charges  revenue adjustments and revenue for undelivered freight are included in this measurement 
revenue for undelivered freight is deferred for financial statement purposes in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  however  we believe including this deferred revenue in our revenue per hundredweight measurements results in a better indicator of changes in our yields by matching total billed revenue with the corresponding weight of those shipments 
weight per shipment fluctuations in weight per shipment can indicate changes in the class  or mix  of freight we receive from our customers  as well as changes in the number of units included in a shipment 
generally  increases in weight per shipment indicate higher demand for our customers products and overall increased economic activity 
average length of haul we consider lengths of haul less than miles to be regional traffic  lengths of haul between miles and  miles to be inter regional traffic  and lengths of haul in excess of  miles to be national traffic 
by analyzing this metric  we can determine the success and growth potential of our service products in these markets 
revenue per shipment this measurement is primarily determined by the three metrics listed above and is used  in conjunction with the number of shipments we receive  to calculate total revenue  excluding adjustments for undelivered freight 
our primary revenue focus is to increase shipment and tonnage growth within our existing infrastructure  generally referred to as increasing density  thereby maximizing asset utilization and labor productivity 
we measure density over many different functional areas of our operations including revenue per service center  linehaul load factor  p d stops per hour  p d shipments per hour  platform pounds handled per hour and platform shipments per hour 
in addition to our focus on density  it is critical for us to obtain an appropriate yield on the shipments we handle 
we manage our yields by focusing on individual account profitability 
we believe yield management and improvements in density are key components in our ability to produce profitable growth 
our primary cost elements are direct wages and benefits associated with the movement of freight  operating supplies and expenses  which includes fuel and repair parts  and depreciation of our equipment fleet and service center facilities 
we gauge our overall success in managing these costs by monitoring our operating ratio  a measure of profitability calculated by dividing total operating expenses by revenue  which also allows industry wide comparisons with our competition 
we continually upgrade our technological capabilities to improve our customer service and lower our operating costs 
our technology provides our customers with visibility of their shipments throughout our network  increases the productivity of our workforce and provides key metrics from which we can monitor our processes

revenue per hundredweight revenue per shipment average length of haul miles during we achieved significant increases in our shipments and tonnage  which accelerated during the second half of the year 
we believe these increases were the result of our ability to gain market share during the year as well as general growth in us industrial production and manufacturing 
as industry capacity tightened in  many of our competitors implemented significant rate increases 
this 
table of contents reversed an industry trend of several years in which many of our competitors had discounted prices 
while we implemented a modest general rate increase in november  our pricing philosophy remained consistent with our strategy throughout the recession  which was to provide best in class on time and claims free service at a fair and equitable price 
we believe more shippers are shifting their focus to evaluating the overall value of the service they receive as industry pricing increases 
we believe this trend  along with other market dynamics  will provide additional opportunities for us to increase tonnage and market share growth in the significant growth in our tonnage resulted in increased density in our network that generally resulted in increased efficiency and productivity 
the overall improvement in our pricing during  combined with the increased density  resulted in improvements in our operating results 
net income increased in by million  or  to million and our operating ratio decreased by basis points to 
our results also reflect reductions in our depreciation and amortization expenses of approximately million  due to changes in the estimated useful lives and salvage values of certain equipment  which are described further under critical accounting policies below 
revenue the increase in revenue during was the result of increases in tonnage and revenue per hundredweight 
tonnage increased for the year ended december   due to the combination of a increase in shipments and a increase in weight per shipment 
the growth in tonnage per day and shipments per day accelerated during the second half of the year  which we believe reflects our gain in market share as well as general economic improvement 
we believe the increase in our weight per shipment also indicates an improving economy  although we also continue to gain market share with large national shippers that typically have heavier shipments 
revenue per hundredweight increased to from in this increase primarily reflects an increase in fuel surcharges  which are designed to offset fluctuations in the cost of petroleum based products and are one of many components included in the overall price for our services 
excluding fuel surcharges  revenue per hundredweight remained consistent between and despite the negative effect on this metric from the increase in weight per shipment 
this consistency reflects our ability to initiate necessary price increases during as industry conditions improved during the year  our ability to obtain price increases strengthened 
we experienced improvement in the year over year change in revenue per hundredweight  excluding fuel surcharges  for each month during the second half of and also implemented a general rate increase on certain of our tariffs effective november  fuel surcharge revenue increased to of revenue from in  as a result of the increased price of diesel fuel during most of our tariffs and contracts provide for a fuel surcharge  which is recorded as additional revenue  as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels 
these levels are generally indexed to the doe s published fuel prices that reset each week 
the fuel surcharge is one of many components included in the overall negotiated price for our transportation services with our customers  although it is generally considered to be a measure of the increase in cost of all petroleum products we use 
we regularly monitor the components of our pricing  including base freight rates and fuel surcharges 
we also address individual account profitability issues with our customers when necessary as part of our effort to minimize the negative impact on our profitability that would likely result from a rapid and significant change in any of our operating expenses 
operating costs and other expenses salaries  wages and benefits increased million or in  which compares favorably with our revenue and tonnage growth of and  respectively 
as a result  and due somewhat to our increased use of purchased transportation in  our salaries  wages and benefits improved to of revenue from in the prior year 
salaries and wages increased million due to a increase in the total number of full time employees and an increase in the number of hours worked by existing employees  which was in direct response to the increase in tonnage during the year 
in addition  we implemented a salary and wage increase for all employees on september  the increased density within our network allowed us to leverage the additional volumes at lower unit costs 
driver wages as a percentage of revenue improved to from in and platform 
table of contents wages improved to of revenue from in the increased density also allowed us to maintain efficient operations  although we did not experience improvement in all of our productivity measures due to the costs of hiring and training new employees 
in our linehaul operations  our laden load average increased 
p d shipments per hour remained consistent with  but our p d stops per hour decreased 
we benefited from a decrease in employee benefit costs as a percentage of salaries and wages to in from in much of this improvement is attributable to the improvement in our group health and dental costs as a percent of salaries and wages 
our group health costs have been favorably impacted by a decrease in the number of claims paid for participants under the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of cobra and an overall decrease in the average severity of health insurance claims 
there is also a day wait period before newly hired employees are eligible to enroll in our health plan and the majority of the employees hired in were hired during the second half of the year 
as a result  our group health costs are likely to increase in future periods as these new employees begin to enroll in our plan 
operating supplies and expenses increased to of revenue in from in this increase is primarily due to the increase in diesel fuel costs  excluding fuel taxes  which is the largest component of operating supplies and expenses 
these costs increased during the year as a result of the combined effect of a increase in our average price per gallon and a increase in gallons consumed 
the increase in fuel consumption is primarily due to the year over year increase in overall miles 
our increased consumption also resulted in the increase to our fuel tax expenses and was the principal driver of the million increase in operating taxes and licenses 
we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments and are therefore subject to market price fluctuations 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased to of revenue in as compared to in our capital expenditure requirements were reduced for due to the available capacity throughout the year in our fleet and service center network 
the operating leverage created by our reduced capital expenditures and the increase in tonnage contributed to the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense as a percent of revenue 
the improvement as a percent of revenue also reflects the approximate million decrease in depreciation expense that resulted from changes in the estimated useful lives and salvage values of certain equipment  effective january  the changes we made are described in more detail under critical accounting policies below 
we purchase linehaul transportation and p d services from other motor carriers and railroads 
we also utilize independent contractors for our container operations 
we utilize these services when it is economically beneficial or when there are imbalances of freight flow within our service center network 
purchased transportation expense increased to of revenue in from in these costs increased primarily because of certain imbalances of freight flow within our network  which is attributable to the significant increase in our tonnage 
in response to our tonnage growth  we increased our full time headcount by  employees since december  the majority of these newly hired employees are drivers and platform employees 
as we begin to balance our internal resources with freight demand  we intend to reduce our use of purchased transportation  as it is more efficient and profitable to utilize our own personnel and equipment 
our effective tax rate for was as compared to in our effective tax rates in and were favorably impacted by alternative fuel tax credits for the use of propane in our operations 
these fuel tax credits were originally scheduled to expire on december   however  they were extended to december  with the passage of the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization  and job creation act of in december our effective tax rate exceeded the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the impact of state taxes and certain non deductible items 

table of contents compared to key financial and operating metrics for and are presented below change change work days revenue in thousands operating ratio net income in thousands diluted earnings per share total tons in thousands total shipments in thousands weight per shipment lbs 
revenue per hundredweight revenue per shipment average length of haul miles our financial results for reflect our operating strengths as we remained profitable despite a significant decline in tonnage and revenue  which resulted from the negative impacts of a recessionary economy and an increasingly competitive operating environment within the ltl industry 
the persistent recessionary economy caused freight demand to weaken throughout when combined with the overcapacity in the ltl industry  the weakened demand created an aggressive and competitive pricing environment 
confronted with this environment and an decline in tonnage  we focused on delivering outstanding service performance  improving the productivity of our employees  managing our variable costs and remaining disciplined with the pricing for our services 
despite the success we had with these measures  we were unable to sufficiently increase our prices or generate enough cost savings to offset our decline in revenue 
as a result  our operating ratio increased to in from in and our earnings per diluted share decreased to for we believe our strategy mitigated much of the negative impact that we could have experienced as a result of the extremely difficult ltl operating environment  since our operating ratio deteriorated by only basis points despite a decline in revenue 
revenue the decrease in revenue during was the result of decreases in tonnage and revenue per hundredweight of and  respectively 
the reduction in tonnage during resulted from a decrease in the number of shipments that was partially offset by a increase in weight per shipment 
the tonnage decrease was primarily attributable to the impact of the recessionary economy on freight demand  since our research indicates there has been no significant change in our market share 
we could experience additional declines in our tonnage and shipments as well as continued pressure on our yields 
however  we believe we have positioned ourselves well  through our commitment to service  to gain additional market share from our existing customers and new customers who seek consistent  claims free and value driven service once industry conditions improve 
revenue per hundredweight decreased to in from in this decrease in our revenue per hundredweight was primarily due to the reduction in fuel surcharge revenue  which resulted from a significant decline in the average price of diesel fuel between the comparable years 
excluding fuel surcharges  revenue per hundredweight remained consistent at for and we were unable to sufficiently increase our overall pricing during due to the competitive pricing environment in the ltl industry 
during the fourth quarter of and throughout  pricing emerged as the principal driver of competition as many carriers attempted to either gain market share or minimize tonnage losses through price discounting 
despite the pricing pressure  we remained committed to our pricing philosophy of charging our customers a fair and reasonable price for outstanding service 
our commitment to service was evidenced by an approximate on time service performance and a historically low cargo claims ratio during fuel surcharge revenue decreased to of revenue in from in most of our tariffs and contracts provide for a fuel surcharge  which is recorded as additional revenue  as diesel fuel prices increase above stated levels 
these levels are generally indexed to the doe s published fuel 
table of contents prices that reset each week 
the fuel surcharge is one of many components included in the overall negotiated price for our transportation services with our customers  although it is generally believed to be a measure of the increase in cost of all petroleum products that we use 
we continuously monitor the components of our pricing  including base freight rates and fuel surcharges 
we also address individual account profitability issues with our customers when necessary as part of our effort to minimize the negative impact on our profitability that would likely result from a rapid and significant change in any of our operating expenses 
operating costs and other expenses salaries  wages and benefits increased to of revenue in from in the increase as a percent of revenue is primarily due to the year over year decline in fuel surcharge revenue  which has no corresponding decrease in the volume of freight moving through our network 
as a result  driver wages increased to of revenue from in platform wages as a percentage of revenue increased to from in while our salaries  wages and benefits increased as a percent of revenue  the million overall decrease is attributable to the year over year reduction in the total number of full time employees  the decline in the number of hours worked and the overall increased productivity of our employees 
our p d shipments per hour increased and p d stops per hour increased  both reflecting the improved efficiencies and utilization of our experienced drivers 
our linehaul laden load average increased 
platform pounds handled per hour increased  which allowed our platform wages to remain consistent as a percent of revenue 
these productivity improvements partially offset the impact on our operating ratio of the annual wage increase provided to our driver and platform employees in september as well as the scheduled increases newly hired employees achieved in as they gained experience 
employee benefit costs increased to of salaries and wages in from in these increases are primarily attributable to increased costs associated with our group health and dental coverage and workers compensation claims experience 
group health and dental costs rose to of total salary and wages in from in due to an increase in the average cost of medical claims per employee  as well as an increase in the number of claims paid for participants who elected coverage under the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of cobra 
legislation passed in lengthened the period of coverage for eligible cobra participants who were involuntarily terminated between september  and february  operating supplies and expenses decreased to of revenue in from in this decrease is primarily due to the decline in diesel fuel costs  excluding fuel taxes  which is the largest component of operating supplies and expenses 
these costs decreased during the year as a result of the combined effect of a decrease in our average price per gallon and a decrease in gallons consumed 
the reduction in fuel consumption is primarily due to the year over year decline in overall miles  as well as a increase in our miles per gallon 
the decreased consumption also lowered our fuel tax expenses and was the principal driver of the million reduction in operating taxes and licenses 
we do not use diesel fuel hedging instruments and are therefore subject to market price fluctuations  which we manage primarily through the application of fuel surcharges 
general supplies and expenses remained consistent as a percent of revenue at for both and these costs remained consistent as a percent of revenue due to our strict cost control measures put in place to manage our variable costs and the decrease in supplies directly related to lower shipment volumes 
the decrease in insurance and claims expense to of revenue from in is attributable to the and decreases in auto liability and cargo claims expenses  respectively 
we self insure a portion of our auto and cargo claims liabilities and obtain excess insurance coverage for claims above our retention levels 
the decrease in our auto liability expenses was primarily due to a million favorable adjustment recorded in the fourth quarter that resulted from improved experience in the number and severity of claims during we believe that our cargo claims expense improved primarily due to the increased training of our employees on claims prevention  which resulted in a historically low cargo claims ratio in and a decrease in total claims paid 

table of contents depreciation and amortization expense increased to of revenue in as compared to in the increase as a percent of revenue reflects the combined impact of the decline in overall revenue in on these fixed costs and our significant investments in real estate and revenue equipment in and consistent with our long term growth strategy  we took advantage of real estate opportunities during  which allowed us not only to expand our service center network  but also to relocate certain operations to larger facilities 
in addition  we made a strategic decision to purchase new revenue equipment in  while retaining the tractors and trailers scheduled to be replaced 
our decision to increase our equipment capacity placed us in a position to accommodate an increase in demand for our services that could have resulted from business failures or consolidation in the ltl industry that we believed were likely to result from the recessionary economy 
other expense  net includes the net investment gains or losses on the cash value of our variable life insurance contracts related to our non qualified deferred compensation plans 
the cash value of these contracts was impacted by the improvement in equity markets during  which favorably affected comparisons with our effective tax rate for and was 
our effective tax rates in and were favorably impacted by alternative fuel tax credits for the use of propane in our operations 
our effective tax rate exceeded the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the impact of state taxes and certain non deductible items 
liquidity and capital resources a summary of our cash flows is presented below in thousands cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash flows provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at end of year we have three primary sources of available liquidity to fund our estimated capital expenditures cash and cash equivalents  cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit agreement  which is described below 
we believe we also have sufficient access to debt and equity markets to provide another source of liquidity  if needed 
on january   we entered into a note purchase agreement pursuant to which we issued million of privately placed senior notes 
we entered into this note purchase agreement to fund planned capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes 
we used a portion of the proceeds to refinance existing indebtedness  including paying down the outstanding balance on our senior unsecured revolving credit agreement 
to facilitate our access to the equity market  we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the sec during the fourth quarter of that provides us with the opportunity to offer and sell shares of common stock on a delayed or continuous basis at indeterminate prices from time to time 
pursuant to this automatic shelf registration  we filed a prospectus supplement and entered into an at the market equity offering sales agreement the atm agreement on february  with stifel  nicolaus company  incorporated stifel nicolaus weisel pursuant to which we may issue and sell  from time to time over a month period through or to stifel nicolaus weisel  shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million the offering 
sales of our common stock in the offering  if any  will be made by means of ordinary brokers transactions on nasdaq  in privately negotiated transactions  or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale at prices relating to prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices as agreed by stifel nicolaus weisel and us 
we have no obligation to sell any shares of our common stock in the offering and may at any time terminate the offering and atm agreement 
as of the date of this annual report on form k  we have not sold any shares of our common stock in the offering 

table of contents capital expenditures the table below sets forth our net capital expenditures for property and equipment  including those obtained through acquisition of business assets and capital leases  for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands land and structures tractors trailers technology other less proceeds from sale total our capital expenditure requirements are generally based upon the expansion in the number and size of service center facilities to support our plan for long term growth  our planned tractor and trailer replacement cycle and forecasted revenue growth 
our capital expenditures for land and structures in were lower than and  as we had sufficient capacity in our service center network at the beginning of the year due to the decline in tonnage during as a result  we opened fewer new facilities during and expansion projects for existing service centers were smaller in scale than in previous years 
due to our current volume trends  however  we anticipate our capital expenditures for land and structures will be significantly higher in than to help ensure our service center network is not a limiting factor to our long term growth 
in addition  we anticipate a significant increase in our capital expenditures for tractors and trailers in  as our purchases for the past three years were primarily limited to replacing a portion of the equipment being retired through the normal replacement cycle 
we currently project capital expenditures  net of anticipated proceeds from dispositions  to be approximately million to million for the year ending december  of our capital expenditures  approximately million to million is allocated for the purchase of service center facilities  construction of new service center facilities or expansion of existing service center facilities  approximately million to million is allocated for the purchase of tractors and trailers  and approximately million to million is allocated for investments in technology 
we expect to fund these capital expenditures through cash flows from operations  the remaining proceeds from the million of privately placed senior notes issued in january  the use of our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and proceeds from the atm agreement  if any 
we believe our current sources of liquidity will be sufficient to satisfy our expected capital expenditures 
we anticipate that there will be additional environmental regulations and legislation resulting from the increased regulatory focus on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions in the united states 
at this time  we cannot predict the requirements of any future regulations 
however  any limitations on the emission of greenhouse gases or other environmental legislation could increase our future capital expenditures and have an adverse impact on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
financing agreements we have a million senior unsecured revolving credit facility pursuant to the terms of an amended and restated credit agreement that matures on august  the credit agreement  with wells fargo  national association as successor by merger to wachovia bank  national association wells fargo serving as administrative agent for the lenders  which also include bank of america  na  branch banking and trust company  suntrust bank  us bank  national association  and high point bank and trust company 
of the million line of credit commitments  million may be used for letters of credit and million may be used for borrowings under wells fargo s sweep program 
the sweep program is a daily cash management tool that automatically initiates borrowings to cover overnight cash requirements up to an aggregate of million or initiates overnight investments for 
table of contents excess cash balances 
in addition  we have the right to request an increase in the line of credit commitments up to a total of million in minimum increments of million 
at our option  revolving loans under the facility bear interest at either i the higher of wells fargo s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus per annum  ii libor one  two  three or six months plus an applicable margin adjusted libor rate  or iii one month libor plus an applicable margin libor index rate 
the applicable margin is determined by a pricing grid in the credit agreement and ranges from to 
the applicable margin for the credit agreement in was 
revolving loans under the sweep program bear interest at the libor index rate 
the credit agreement contains customary covenants  including financial covenants that require us to observe a maximum ratio of debt to total capital and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
any future wholly owned subsidiaries of old dominion would be required to guarantee payment of all of our obligations under the facility 
the amounts outstanding and remaining borrowing capacity under our credit agreement are presented below december  in thousands facility limit line of credit borrowings outstanding letters of credit total borrowing capacity commitment fees ranging from to are charged quarterly in arrears on the aggregate unutilized portion of the credit agreement 
letter of credit fees equal to the applicable margin for adjusted libor rate loans are charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during the quarter 
the commitment fees and letter of credit fees were and  respectively  for the credit agreement in in addition  a facing fee at an annual rate of is charged quarterly in arrears on the daily average aggregate stated amount of all letters of credit outstanding during such quarter 
we have two unsecured senior note agreements with an aggregate amount outstanding of million at december  these notes call for periodic principal payments with maturities in and  of which million is due in the next twelve months 
interest rates on these notes are fixed at and 
the effective average interest rate on our outstanding senior note agreements was at december  and with the exception of borrowings pursuant to the credit agreement  interest rates are fixed on all of our debt instruments 
therefore  short term exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is limited to our line of credit facility 
we do not currently use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
our credit agreement limits the amount of dividends that could be paid to shareholders to the greater of i million  ii the amount of dividends paid in the immediately preceding fiscal year  or iii an amount equal to of net income from the immediately preceding fiscal year 
we did not declare or pay a dividend on our common stock in or  and we have no plans to declare or pay a dividend in a significant decrease in demand for our services could limit our ability to generate cash flow and affect profitability 
most of our debt agreements have covenants that require stated levels of financial performance  which if not achieved could cause acceleration of the payment schedules 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
we do not anticipate a significant decline in business levels or financial performance that would cause us to violate any such covenants in the future  and we believe the combination of our existing credit agreement along with our additional borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet foreseeable seasonal and long term capital needs 
recent developments at december   the outstanding balance on our credit agreement of million is reported as a long term liability despite the facility s maturity within one year of our balance sheet date  as we 
table of contents utilized a portion of the million of proceeds obtained from the privately placed senior notes to refinance the outstanding balance on the credit agreement 
we have initiated discussions regarding the renewal and extension of our credit agreement with wells fargo  the administrative agent for the lenders  as well as other lenders in our bank group 
we intend and believe we have the ability to extend the current credit agreement with adjustments to our interest rates and fees to current market rates 
we plan to finalize a new agreement in the second quarter of if we are unable to do so  we believe our remaining sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our expected liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
as discussed above  we entered into a note purchase agreement on january  pursuant to which we issued million of privately placed senior notes 
in addition and as discussed above  we entered into the atm agreement on february  that allows us to issue and sell from time to time shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million 
common stock split on july   our board of directors approved a three for two common stock split for shareholders of record as of the close of business on august  on august   those shareholders received one additional share of common stock for every two shares owned 
in lieu of fractional shares  shareholders received a cash payment based on the average of the high and low sales prices of the common stock on the record date

off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 

table of contents critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements  we apply the following critical accounting policies that we believe affect our judgments and estimates of amounts recorded in certain assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
these critical accounting policies are further described in note of the notes to the financial statements included in item of this report 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue based upon when our transportation services have been completed in accordance with the bill of lading contract  our general tariff provisions or contractual agreements with our customers 
generally  this occurs when we complete the delivery of a shipment 
for transportation services not completed at the end of a reporting period  we use a percentage of completion method to allocate the appropriate revenue to each separate reporting period 
under this method  we develop a factor for each uncompleted shipment by dividing the actual number of days in transit at the end of a reporting period by that shipment s standard delivery time schedule 
this factor is applied to the total revenue for that shipment and revenue is allocated between reporting periods accordingly 
allowances for uncollectible accounts and revenue adjustments we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate this allowance by analyzing the aging of our customer receivables  our historical loss experience and other trends and factors affecting the credit risk of our customers 
we determine customer receivables to be past due when payment has not been received by the invoice due date 
write offs occur when we determine an account to be uncollectible and could differ from our allowance estimate as a result of factors such as changes in the overall economic environment or risks surrounding our customers 
additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments 
we periodically review the underlying assumptions in our estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts to ensure that the allowance reflects the most recent trends and factors 
we also maintain an allowance for revenue adjustments resulting from billing corrections  customer allowances  money back service guarantees and other miscellaneous revenue adjustments 
these revenue adjustments are recorded in our revenue from operations 
we use historical experience  trends and current information to update and evaluate these estimates 
management believes the methodologies for estimating these allowances to be reliable based on the accuracy of our estimates in prior periods 
as such  we do not anticipate any near term changes in our methodologies for these estimates 
claims and insurance accruals claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated cost of claims for cargo loss and damage  bipd  workers compensation  long term disability  group health and group dental not covered by insurance 
the related costs are charged to insurance and claims expense except for workers compensation  long term disability  group health and group dental  which are charged to employee benefits expense 
insurers providing excess coverage above retention levels adjust their premiums to cover insured losses and for other market factors 
as a result  we periodically evaluate our self insured retention levels to determine the most cost efficient balance between self insurance and excess coverage 
in establishing accruals for claims and insurance expenses  we evaluate and monitor each claim individually  and we use factors such as historical claims development experience  known trends and third party estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability 
we believe the assumptions and methods used to estimate these liabilities are reasonable  however  any changes in the severity of previously reported claims  significant changes in the medical costs and regulatory changes affecting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods 

table of contents property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated economic lives 
management uses historical experience  certain assumptions and estimates in determining the economic life of each asset 
periodically  we review property and equipment for impairment due to changes in operational and market conditions  and we adjust the carrying value and economic life of any impaired asset as appropriate 
during the first quarter of  we completed an evaluation of the estimated useful lives and salvage values for our equipment and determined that the actual period of service of certain revenue equipment exceeded that of our previously estimated useful lives 
as a result  we extended the estimated useful lives of most of our tractors to years from years and extended the estimated useful lives of our trailers to years from years 
in addition  we reduced the estimated salvage values associated with this equipment to more accurately reflect the value we believe such equipment will have at the end of its respective useful life 
we made similar changes to the estimated useful lives and salvage values for certain of our other equipment but the results of these changes had less of an impact on our future depreciation expense 
as a result of the impact on depreciation from these changes that were effective january   income from continuing operations and net income in increased by approximately million and million  respectively  or per diluted share 
effective january   estimated economic lives for structures are to years  revenue equipment is to years  other equipment is to years  and leasehold improvements are the lesser of the economic life of the leasehold improvement or the remaining life of the lease 
the use of different assumptions  estimates or significant changes in the resale market for our equipment could result in material changes in the carrying value and related depreciation of our assets 
inflation most of our expenses are affected by inflation  which typically results in increased operating costs 
in response to fluctuations in the cost of petroleum products  particularly diesel fuel  we generally include a fuel surcharge in our tariffs and contractual agreements 
the fuel surcharge is designed to offset the cost of diesel fuel above a base price and increases as diesel fuel prices escalate over the base  which is generally indexed to the doe s published fuel prices that reset each week 
volatility in the price of diesel fuel  independent of inflation  has impacted our business  as described in this report 
however  we do not believe inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations for each of the past three years
