table of contents overview company background we provide financial services technology solutions  including electronic commerce systems and services such as transaction processing  electronic bill payment and presentment  business process outsourcing  document distribution services  and software and systems solutions 
we serve approximately  clients worldwide including banks  thrifts  credit unions  investment management firms  leasing and finance companies  retailers  merchants  and government agencies 
the majority of our revenue is generated from recurring account and transaction fees under contracts with terms ranging from three to five years  and we benefit from high contract renewal rates with our existing clients 
the majority of the services we provide to our clients are non discretionary in nature and are necessary for them to operate their business 
our operations are primarily in the united states and are comprised of the payments and industry products payments segment  the financial institution services financial segment  and the corporate and other segment 
the payments segment primarily provides electronic bill payment and presentment services and debit and other card based payment products and services to meet the electronic transaction processing needs of the financial services industry 
the businesses in this segment also provide internet banking  investment account processing services for separately managed accounts  card and print personalization services  and fraud and risk management products and services 
the financial segment provides banks  thrifts and credit unions with account processing services  item processing services  loan origination and servicing products  cash management and consulting services  and other products and services that support numerous types of financial transactions 
the corporate and other segment primarily consists of unallocated corporate overhead expenses  amortization of acquisition related intangible assets and intercompany eliminations 
industry trends market conditions and volatility over the past two years have created a difficult operating environment for financial institutions and other businesses in the united states and internationally 
as a result  financial institutions have exercised caution in their information technology spending 
despite this challenging environment  in  our revenue was billion  net income per share from continuing operations was  and net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was million which increased  and  respectively  as compared to we believe these financial results demonstrate the resilience of our recurring fee based revenue model  the largely non discretionary nature of our products and services  and mild improvement in the general condition of the financial industry 
we believe that financial institutions are increasingly focused on technology solutions that can help them win and retain customers  generate incremental revenue and enhance their operating efficiency 
we anticipate that we will benefit over the long term from the trend of financial institutions moving from in house transaction processing solutions to outsourced solutions 
in each of and  approximately of all financial institutions in the united states failed or were subject to government action  which has resulted in the loss of a small number of our clients 
however  we believe that the number of government actions in will decline slightly as compared to the increase in bank failures and forced consolidations during the past two years has been  to some extent  offset by a general decline in the level of acquisition activity among financial institutions 
a consolidation benefits us when a newly combined institution is processed on our platform  or elects to move to one of our platforms  and negatively impacts us when a competing platform is selected 
consolidations and acquisitions also impact our financial results due to early contract termination fees in our multi year client contracts 
these fees are primarily generated when an existing client is acquired by another financial institution and can vary from period to period based on the number and size of clients that are acquired and how early in the contract term the contract is terminated 
we generally do not receive contract termination fees when a financial institution is subject to a government action 
in addition  new legislation  such as the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  will result in numerous new regulations that will impact the financial industry  although it is too early to determine what impact this complex legislation will have on us or our clients 

table of contents enterprise priorities we continue to implement a series of strategic initiatives to help accomplish our mission of providing integrated technology and services solutions which enable best in class results for our clients 
these strategic initiatives include active portfolio management of our various businesses  enhancing the overall value of our existing client relationships  improving operational effectiveness  being disciplined in our allocation of capital  and differentiating through innovation in our products and services 
based on our financial results and our focus on growth and innovation in  we believe we achieved our enterprise priorities for the year 
with respect to  our three key enterprise priorities are i to deliver an increased level of high quality revenue growth and increase our earnings per share as compared to  ii to further center the fiserv culture on growth resulting in more clients and deeper client relationships and to secure a higher share of strategic solutions  and iii to provide innovative solutions that increase differentiation and enhance results for our clients 
business developments despite the challenges facing the financial industry  we continue to invest in the development of new and strategic products in categories such as payments  including zashpay  our person to person payment service  account processing  including acumen  our next generation account processing platform for large credit unions  and others that we believe will increase value to our clients and enhance the capabilities of our existing solutions 
we believe our wide range of market leading solutions along with the investments we are making in new and differentiated products will favorably position us and our clients to capitalize on the opportunities in the marketplace 
critical accounting policies general our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances 
actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates 
valuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values 
the estimates used to determine the fair value of long lived assets  such as intangible assets  can be complex and require significant judgments 
we use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists  when necessary  to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long lived assets 
we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods 
we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate 
we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
accounting guidance requires us to perform a two step impairment test on goodwill 
first  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows and we compare the aggregate fair values to our market capitalization as an assessment of the 
table of contents appropriateness of our fair value measurements 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the unit s net assets  goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the fair value of the unit  then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and any impairment charge 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions  which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions 
our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of determined that our goodwill was not impaired 
we review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value 
given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances  an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge  which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
based on our impairment assessments in  we determined that our acquired intangible assets were not impaired 
revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is generated from monthly account and transaction based fees 
deferred revenue consists primarily of advance billings for services 
revenue is recognized as services are provided 
revenue is primarily recognized under service agreements that are long term in nature  generally three to five years  and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions 
given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition  our revenue recognition practices do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations 
additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
other we do not participate in  nor have we created  any off balance sheet variable interest entities or other off balance sheet financing  other than letters of credit 
we use derivative financial instruments for managing our exposure to changes in interest rates  managing our ratio of fixed to floating rate debt and foreign exchange rate risks 
we do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
results of operations components of revenue and expenses the following summary describes the components of revenue and expenses as presented in our consolidated statements of income 
a description of our revenue recognition policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
processing and services processing and services revenue  which in represented of our consolidated revenue  is primarily generated from account and transaction based fees under contracts that generally have terms of three to five years 
revenue is recognized when the related transactions are processed and services have been performed 
processing and services revenue are most reflective of our business performance because a significant amount of our total operating profit is generated by these services 
cost of processing and services includes costs directly associated with providing services to clients and includes the following personnel  equipment and data communication  infrastructure costs  including costs to maintain applications  client support  depreciation and amortization  and other operating expenses

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs are i to fund normal operating expenses  ii to meet the principal and interest requirements of our outstanding indebtedness  and iii to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments 
we believe these needs will be satisfied using our cash flow generated by operations  our cash and cash equivalents at december  of million and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility of million at december  years ended december  increase decrease in millions income from continuing operations depreciation and amortization share based compensation loss on early debt extinguishment dividend from unconsolidated affiliate net changes in working capital and other operating cash flow capital expenditures our net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations  or operating cash flow  increased million  or  to million in from million in our operating cash flow in included a million dividend from stoneriver  of which we own  that we do not expect to recur on an annual basis 
our current policy is to use our operating cash flow to repay debt and to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions and share repurchases  rather than to pay dividends 
our capital expenditures of million and million in and  respectively  were less than of our total revenue in each year 
in the fourth quarter of  we received million from stoneriver  of which we own  comprised of a million dividend and a million repayment of a loan 
the portion of this dividend that represented a return on our investment  million  is reported in cash flows from operating activities 
share repurchases we purchased million  million and million of our common stock in  and  respectively

shares repurchased are generally held for issuance in connection with our equity plans 
indebtedness december  in millions senior term loan senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due other borrowings long term debt including current maturities in september  we issued million of senior notes due in and we used the proceeds from this offering to repay a portion of our senior term loan borrowings and  as described below  to repurchase a 
table of contents portion of our senior notes due in in  our debt repayments  net of the million senior notes offering  totaled million 
in addition  we paid million of premium and other costs associated with the repurchase of the senior notes 
at december   our long term debt consisted primarily of billion senior term loan borrowings and billion of senior notes 
we were in compliance with all financial debt covenants in senior term loan in december  we entered into an unsecured senior term loan facility with a syndicate of banks 
term loan borrowings under this facility bear interest at a variable rate based on libor plus a specified margin or the bank s base rate and mature in november the weighted average variable interest rate on the term loan borrowings was at december  the term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants substantially similar to those contained in the revolving credit facility described below 
senior notes in september  we issued million of senior notes due in october and million of senior notes due in october  which pay interest semi annually on april and october commencing on april  our senior notes due in november and senior notes due in november pay interest at the stated rate on may and november of each year 
the interest rates applicable to the senior notes are subject to an increase of up to two percent in the event that our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade 
the indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants that  among other matters  limit our ability to consolidate or merge into  or convey  transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to  another person  our and certain of our subsidiaries ability to create or assume liens  and our and certain of our subsidiaries ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions

there are no significant commitment fees and no compensating balance requirements 
the revolving credit facility contains various restrictions and covenants that require us  among other things  i to limit our consolidated indebtedness to no more than three and one half times consolidated net earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments and ii to maintain consolidated net earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense 
the facility expires in september as of december   we issued letters of credit totaling million under the new facility  and had available borrowings of million 
interest rate hedge contracts we maintain interest rate swap agreements swaps with total notional values of billion and billion at december  and  respectively  to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
additionally  in  we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements forward starting swaps with total notional values of million to hedge against changes in interest rates applicable to forecasted fixed rate borrowings 
the swaps effectively fix the interest rates on floating rate term loan 
table of contents borrowings at a weighted average rate of approximately  prior to financing spreads and related fees  and have expiration dates through september the forward starting swaps  which expire in september  effectively fix the benchmark interest rate on forecasted five year and ten year borrowings at weighted average rates of approximately and  respectively 
shelf registration statement in  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission 
under the registration statement  we may sell common stock  preferred stock and debt securities  or a combination thereof 
each time we sell securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement  we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of the securities being offered and of the offering 
we may offer and sell the securities pursuant to this prospectus from time to time in one or more of the following ways through underwriters or dealers  through agents  directly to purchasers or through a combination of any of these methods of sales 
proceeds from the sale of these securities may be used to repay debt or for working capital  acquisitions or general corporate purposes 
other access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital  our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions 
our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors  including general market conditions  interest rates  credit ratings on our debt securities  perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock 
as of december   we had a credit rating of baa with a stable outlook from moody s investors service  inc moody s and bbb with a stable outlook from standard poor s ratings services s p on our senior unsecured debt securities 
the interest rate payable on our senior notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if moody s or s p downgrades or subsequently upgrades the debt rating applicable to the notes 
if the ratings from moody s or s p decrease below investment grade  the per annum interest rate on the notes is subject to increase by up to 
in no event will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes nor will the total increase in the per annum interest rate exceed above the original interest rate 
the interest rates on any series of notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment if the notes becomes rated a or its equivalent or higher by moody s and a or its equivalent or higher by s p  in each case with a stable or positive outlook 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements other than letters of credit 
the following table details our contractual cash obligations at december  in millions total less than year years years more than years long term debt including interest minimum operating lease payments purchase obligations income tax obligations total interest and operating lease payments are reported on a pre tax basis 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  interest rates  currency exchange rates  indices  correlations or other market factors  such as liquidity  will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments 
we are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on outstanding debt  investments of subscriber funds and foreign currency risk 
we actively monitor these risks through a variety of control procedures involving senior management 
in connection with processing electronic payments transactions  the funds we receive from subscribers are invested from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable merchants 
these subscriber funds are invested in short term instruments that are guaranteed by the united states government 
subscriber funds  which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets  can fluctuate significantly based on consumer bill payment activity  and totaled approximately billion as of december  based on interest rates and subscriber funds balances at december   a increase in applicable interest rates would increase our annual income from continuing operations by approximately million  and if applicable interest rates decreased to zero  our annual income from continuing operations would decrease by less than million 
we manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floating rate debt and through the use of interest rate hedge contracts 
we currently use interest rate swaps with total notional values of billion and forward starting swaps with total notional values of million at december   to partially hedge our exposure to interest rate changes and to control financing costs 
generally  under these swaps  we agree with a counter party to exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts based on an agreed notional amount 
based on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates at december   a increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in by approximately million 
we conduct business in the us and in foreign countries and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our non us dollar denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in foreign currency rates against the us dollar 
if these rates were higher or lower at december   there would not have been a material adverse impact on our annual income from continuing operations or financial position
