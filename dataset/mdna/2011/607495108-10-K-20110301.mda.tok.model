item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the selected financial data  our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in those forward looking statements as a result of many factors including those under the caption forward looking information in item overview in the second quarter of  we made a strategic decision to rationalize our product lines and exit the specialty print and direct mail market  choosing to focus our resources on our growing custom folding carton line 
as a result of the rationalization  we have begun to  and expect to continue to realize a significant improvement in operating performance 
in addition  we believe we are more effective in sales and marketing in the custom folding carton market with a more focused approach and better utilization of our resources 
our custom folding carton customers are generally in the healthcare  confectionary  food and food service  and automotive industries  including private label manufacturers 
our expertise in this market is our on demand processing capability 
we manufacture and print the specific quantities of custom folding cartons required by our customers as needed by them as opposed to printing long runs and creating inventory and obsolescence challenges either for our customers or ourselves 
as a result  we do not require minimum print orders and are more flexible than most printers in addressing our customers needs 
this capability has served extremely well for our private label customers who may have several of the same carton requirements  but with varying print requirements for their customers 
we also plan to continue developing our stock packaging and personalized print product lines 
our stock packaging line serves primarily private confectionaries and  therefore is seasonal in nature and driven by the economy 
we believe that we are a leader in the private confectionery industry with over  customers that we serve around the world 
our personalized print product line is focused on its store  catalog and web sales 
because we provide products such as personalized dinner and cocktail napkins  small boxes for sundries at events  and other celebration type items for both the retail and corporate markets  this product line is also heavily impacted by economic downturns 
we can compete with much larger companies in the personalized print industry  however we have developed a strong brand in krepe kraft among event planners and wedding coordinators 
our website  www 
partybasics 
com  has had some success as our retail outlet 
we also provide our products to third party web stores
