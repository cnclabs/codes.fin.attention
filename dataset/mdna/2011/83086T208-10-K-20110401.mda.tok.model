we sell our hedetang brand bottled fruit beverages domestically  primarily to supermarkets in the prc 
we sell our other fruit related products to domestic customers 
in  there was an increase in price of concentrated apple juice in the international market because of the shortage in fresh apples produced by europe and china due to bad weather 
as a result  our export rate increased from in to in we currently market our hedetang brand fruit beverages in only certain regions of the prc 
we plan to expand the market presence of hedetang over a broader geographic area in the prc 
in particular  we plan to expand our glass bottle production line to produce higher margin portable fruit juice beverages targeting consumers in more populated chinese cities 
in january  we engaged a beverage distributor in beijing to focus on the sales and marketing of our fruit juice and fruit cider beverages to food and beverage wholesalers and retailers in the beijing area 
in the first quarter of  we renewed our contract with this distributor and we also increased the number of distributors in the beijing area 
we also added pear juice and apple juice to our product portfolio in the first quarter of currently we produce six flavors of fruit beverages in ml glass bottles and ml glass bottles  including apple juice  pear juice  kiwifruit juice  mulberry juice  kiwifruit cider and mulberry cider 
in the fourth quarter of  our design team developed new packaging for our fruit beverages

we plan to continue to focus on creating new high margin products in the future to supplement our current product offering 
in the first quarter of  we developed and introduced a fruit cider beverage that tested well in the market 
the gross margin of our fruit cider beverages was and for and  respectively  versus an average gross margin of and for our pure fruit beverages during the same period 
in july  we set up a vegetable and fresh fruits division to promote the sales of fresh kiwifruit in the prc domestic market 
revenue from sales of fresh kiwifruit in and was million and million  respectively  which increased from million in the margin of fresh fruits was and for and  respectively 
in the first quarter of  we developed a series of high fiber fruit juice beverages  which includes flavor of kiwifruit  apple  mulberry and pomegranate 
initial shipments of our new beverages began on january  
table of contents we believe that continuous investment in research and development is a key component to being a leader in fruit juice concentrate and fruit beverage quality 
as of december   we had an internal research and development team of approximately employees  and we retain external experts and research institutions for additional consultation when necessary 
in the first quarter of  we entered into three contracts with an outside research institute to research and develop new products 
the terms of these contracts were from january to january with a monthly payment of rmb  or  according to the exchange rate of december  our research and development effort emphasizes the design and development of our processing technology with the goal of decreasing processing costs  optimizing our production capabilities and maintaining product quality 
we intend to continue to invest in research and development to respond to and anticipate customer needs 
in and  our research and development expenses were  and  respectively 
our business is highly seasonal and can be greatly affected by weather because of the seasonal nature in the growing and harvesting of fruits and vegetables 
our core products are apple  pear and kiwifruit juice concentrates  which are produced from july or august to april of the following year 
the squeezing season for i apples is from august to january or february  ii pears is from july or august until april of next year  and iii kiwifruit is from september through december 
typically  a substantial portion of our revenues is earned during our first and fourth quarters 
to minimize the seasonality of our business  we make continued efforts in identifying new products with harvesting seasons complementary to our current product mix 
our goal is to lengthen our squeezing season  thus increasing our annual production of fruit juice concentrates and fruit beverages 
in the first quarter of  we introduced mulberry and kiwifruit cider beverages in the chinese market 
unlike fruit juice concentrates  which can only be produced during the squeezing season  such fruit beverages are made out of fruit juice concentrates and can be produced and sold in all seasons 
sales from our branded name beverage increased from million in to million in with continuous efforts in marketing of our beverages in domestic market  we believe that our seasonality will be reduced 
fresh fruits are the primary raw materials needed for the production of our products 
our raw materials mainly consist of apples  pears and kiwifruits 
the purchase of fresh fruits represented and of our cost of sales in and  respectively 
other raw materials used in our business include pectic enzyme  amylase  auxiliary power fuels and other power sources such as coal  electricity and water 
we purchase raw materials from local markets and fruit growers that deliver directly to our plants 
we have implemented a fruit purchasing program in areas surrounding our factories 
in addition  we organize purchasing centers in rich fruit production areas  helping farmers deliver fruit to our purchasing agents easily and in a timely manner 
we are then able to deliver the fruit directly to our factory for production 
we have assisted local farmers in their development of kiwifruit fields to help ensure a high quality product throughout the production channel 
our raw material supply chain is highly fragmented and raw fruit prices are highly volatile in china 
fruit concentrate and fruit juice beverage companies generally do not enter into purchasing agreements 
in addition to raw materials  we purchase various ingredients and packaging materials such as sweeteners  glass and plastic bottles  cans and packing barrels 
we generally purchase our materials or supplies from multiple suppliers 
we are not dependent on any one supplier or group of suppliers

table of contents shaanxi and liaoning provinces  where our manufacturing facilities are located  are large fruit producing provinces 
we own and operate four manufacturing facilities in the prc  all of which are strategically located near fruit growing centers so that we can better preserve the freshness of the fruits and lower our transportation costs 
to take advantage of economies of scale and to enhance our production efficiency  generally  each of our manufacturing facilities has a focus on products made from one particular fruit according to the proximity of such manufacturing to the sources of supply for that fruit 
our kiwifruit processing facilities are located in zhouzhi county of shaanxi province  which has the largest planting area of apples and kiwifruit in the prc 
our pear processing facilities are located in shaanxi province  which is the main pear producing province in the prc 
our apple processing facilities are located in liaoning province  a region that abounds with high acidity apples 
as we use the same production line for concentrated apple juice and concentrated pear juice and both shaanxi province and liaoning province are rich in fresh apple and pear production  our liaoning facilities also produced concentrated apple juice and our shaanxi province facilities also produced concentrated apple juice based on customer need 
we believe that these regions provide adequate supply of raw materials for our production needs in the foreseeable future

actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following reflects the more critical accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
use of estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and this requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure at contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
the significant areas requiring the use of management estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  estimated useful life and residual value of property  plant and equipment  provision for staff benefit  valuation of change in fair value of warrant liability  recognition and measurement of deferred income taxes and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and actions management may undertake in the future  actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates

for purposes of determining our cost of sales of kiwifruit seeds  we apply the relative sales value costing method 
in calculating the gross margin of kiwifruit seeds  we applied the weighted average method to simplify the calculation 
in applying this method  we first calculated the average revenue of kiwifruit seeds and kiwifruit juice that can be produced from one ton of kiwifruit  based on our estimate in a normal production situation in the applicable period 
this percentage is then applied to actual cost for the production of kiwifruit juice to calculate the actual cost of sales for kiwifruit seeds and concentrated kiwifruit juice in the period covered by the financial statements

consequently  our costs  revenue and operating margins may be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates  primarily between the us dollar and chinese currencies 
proceeds from equity financings are one of our major sources of working capital  which is denominated in us dollars 
our financial position and results of operations are also affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between the functional currency which is in us dollars and currencies used in our foreign operations 
foreign currency translation adjustments resulted in an increase of million in and a decrease of  in fiscal to shareholders equity 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the statements of operations of our businesses outside the us into us dollars affects year over year comparability 
we generally have not hedged against these types of currency risks because cash flows from the prc operations have been reinvested locally 
interest rate risk at december   approximately million of our outstanding borrowings were subject to changes in interest rates  however  we do not use derivatives to manage this risk 
the interest rate on our loans ranges from to per annum
