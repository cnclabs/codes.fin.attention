for  the pro forma earnings per common share basic was calculated using the net income for the months ended december   as presented on the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
the weighted average shares outstanding was calculated using those shares available to eligible members in the conversion  for the period prior to the ipo  and the actual weighted average shares outstanding for the period after the ipo 
earnings per common share diluted is based on the pro forma weighted shares outstanding basic adjusted by the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding had potentially dilutive common shares been issued and reduced by the number of common shares that could have been purchased from the proceeds of the potentially dilutive shares 
outstanding options have been excluded from the diluted earnings per sha re for the pro forma year ended december   because their inclusion would be anti dilutive 
although there were  dilutive potential common shares at december   they did not impact the pro forma earnings per share number as shown 
see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
for  the pro forma earnings per common share basic and diluted is presented to depict the impact of our conversion described above  as prior to the conversion we did not have any outstanding common shares 
the pro forma earnings per common share basic and diluted was computed using only the shares of the our common stock issued to eligible members in the conversion  and does not include any shares issued to new investors in connection with our ipo or the impact of the cash elections made by eligible members 
we had no common stock equivalents outstanding for the periods presented prior to that would create a dilutive effect on pro forma earnings per share 
gross premiums written is the sum of both direct premiums written and assumed premiums written before the effect of ceded reinsurance 
direct premiums written are the premiums on all policies our insurance subsidiaries have issued during the year 
assumed premiums written are premiums that our insurance subsidiaries have received from any authorized state mandated pools and a previous fronting facility 
see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
net premiums written is the sum of direct premiums written and assumed premiums written less ceded premiums written 
ceded premiums written is the portion of direct premiums written that we cede to our reinsurers under our reinsurance contracts 
see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
combined ratio is the sum of the losses and lae expense  the commission expense  dividends to policyholders  and the underwriting and other operating expenses  all divided by net earned premiums 
because we only have one operating segment  holding company expenses are included in the combined ratio 
in connection with our january  assumption of the assets  liabilities and operations of the fund  our nevada insurance subsidiary assumed the fund s rights and obligations associated with the lpt agreement  a retroactive quota share reinsurance agreement with third party reinsurers  which substantially reduced exposure to losses for pre july  nevada insured risks 
pursuant to the lpt agreement  the fund initially ceded billion in liabilities for incurred but unpaid losses and lae  which represented substantially all of the fund s outstanding losses as of june  for claims with original dates of injury prior to july  deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement reflects the unamortized gain from our lpt agreement 
under gaap  this gain is deferred and is being amortized using the recovery method  whereby the amortization is determined by the proportion of actual reinsurance recoveries to total estimated recoveries  and the amortization is reflected in losses and lae 
we periodically reevaluate the remaining direct reserves subject to the lpt agreement 
our reevaluation results in corresponding adjustments  if needed  to reserves  ceded reserves  reinsurance recoverables and the deferred reinsurance gain  with the net effect being an increase or decrease  as the case may be  to net income 
we define net income before impact of the deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement as net income less a amortization of deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement and b adjustments to lpt agreement ceded reserves 
for  we define pro forma earnings per share basic and diluted before impact of the lpt agreement as net income before impact of the deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement divided by the common shares issued in our conversion 
these are not measurements of financial performance under gaap  but rather reflect the difference in accounting treatment between statutory and gaap  and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap

we present pro forma earnings per share basic and diluted before impact of the deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement because we believe that it is an important supplemental measure of performance by outstanding common share issued in our conversion 
the lpt agreement was a non recurring transaction which does not result in ongoing cash benefits and consequently we believe these presentations are useful in providing a meaningful understanding of our operating performance 
in addition  we believe these non gaap measures  as we have defined them  are helpful to our management in identifying trends in our performance because the item excluded has limited significance in our current and ongoing operations

in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors described in item a of this report 
our actual results in future periods may differ from those referred to herein due to a number of factors  including the risks described in the sections entitled risk factors and forward looking statements elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a nevada holding company 
through our insurance subsidiaries  we provide workers compensation insurance coverage to select  small businesses in low to medium hazard industries 
workers compensation insurance is provided under a statutory system wherein most employers are required to provide coverage for their employees medical  disability  vocational rehabilitation  and or death benefit costs for work related injuries or illnesses 
we provide workers compensation insurance in states and the district of columbia  with a concentration in california 
our revenues are primarily comprised of net premiums earned  net investment income  and net realized gains losses on investments 
we target small businesses  as we believe that this market is characterized by fewer competitors  more attractive pricing  and stronger persistency when compared to the us workers compensation insurance industry in general 
we believe we are able to price our policies at levels which are competitive and profitable over the long term 
our underwriting approach is to consistently underwrite small business accounts at an appropriate and competitive price without sacrificing long term profitability and stability for short term top line revenue growth 
we market and sell our workers compensation insurance products through independent local  regional and national agents and brokers  and through our strategic partnerships and alliances  including our principal partners adp  inc and anthem blue cross anthem 
on october   we acquired of the outstanding common stock of amcomp incorporated amcomp for million the acquisition 
our results of operations for include the acquired operations of amcomp for the period november  through december  results of operations our goal is to maintain focus on disciplined underwriting and to continue to pursue profitable growth opportunities across market cycles  however  we continue to be affected by the impacts of the most recent economic recession 
the pace of recovery remains uncertain and  although it appears to us that the declines in total employment and payroll may have leveled off  we do not believe the situation will significantly improve in the near term 
in  we reduced our expenses while maintaining and improving our ability to provide services to our customers 
we believe that we will be positioned to grow our business when the economy and employment trends improve 
we measure our performance by our ability to increase stockholders equity  including the impact of the deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement deferred gain  over the long term 
our stockholders equity  including the deferred gain  was million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
stockholders equity  including the deferred gain  is a non gaap measure that is defined as total stockholders equity plus the deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement  which we believe is an important supplemental measure of our capital position 
stockholders equity on a gaap basis was million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
overall  net income was million  million  and million in   and net income decreased primarily due to year over year reductions in net premiums earned  increasing combined ratios decreasing underwriting income  and the impact of net investment income and realized gains losses on investments 
underwriting loss income is determined by deducting losses and lae  commission expenses  dividends to policyholders  and underwriting and other operating expenses from net premiums earned 
our underwriting loss income was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
investment income and realized gains losses on investments  along with our interest expense and income tax expense  further contribute to our net income 
the comparative components of net income are set forth in the following table for the years ended december in thousands net premiums earned net investment income realized gains losses on investments other income total revenues losses and lae commission expense dividends to policyholders underwriting and other operating expenses interest expense income tax expense total expenses net income net income before impact of the deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement we define net income before impact of the deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement as net income less a amortization of deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement and b adjustments to lpt agreement ceded reserves 
deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement reflects the unamortized gain from our lpt agreement 
under gaap  this gain is deferred and is being amortized using the recovery method  whereby the amortization is determined by the proportion of actual reinsurance recoveries to total estimated recoveries  and the amortization is reflected in losses and lae 
we periodically reevaluate the remaining direct reserves subject to the lpt agreement 
our reevaluation results in corresponding adjustments  if needed  to reserves  ceded reserves  reinsurance recoverables and the deferred reinsurance gain  with the net effect being an increase or decrease  as the case may be  to net income 
net income b efore impact of the deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement is not a measurement of financial performance under gaap  but rather reflects the difference in accounting treatment between statutory and gaap  and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income before income taxes or net income or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap 
we present net income before impact of the deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement because we believe that it is an important supplemental measure of operating performance to be used by analysts  investors and other interested parties in evaluating us 
the lpt agreement was a non recurring transaction which does not result in ongoing cash benefits  and  consequently  we believe this presentation is useful in providing a meaningful understanding of our operating performance 
in addition  we believe this non gaap measure  as we have defined it  is helpful to our management in identifying trends in our performance because the excluded item has limited significance in our current and ongoing operations 
the table below shows the reconciliation of net income to net income before impact of the deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement for the years ended december  in thousands net income less impact of the deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement net income before impact of the deferred reinsurance gain lpt agreement net premiums earned net premiums earned declined million for the year ended december   compared to prior year 
this decrease reflects the impacts of the recession  including high unemployment and fewer hours worked  declines in our policyholders payroll  lower net rates  and our application of disciplined pricing objectives and underwriting guidelines in a highly competitive market 
the increase in net premiums earned for the year ended december   compared to the same period of  was primarily due to the acquisition 
this increase in was partially offset by lower premiums  primarily in california and nevada  as a result of rate reductions  competition  and impacts of economic conditions 
the following table shows the percentage change in our in force policy count  average policy size  and payroll exposure  upon which our premiums are based  and net rate as of december for each of the periods presented 
percentage increase decrease over percentage decrease over in force policy count average in force policy size in force payroll exposure net rate net rate  defined as total premium in force divided by total insured payroll exposure  is a function of a variety of factors  including rate changes  underwriting risk profiles and pricing  and changes in business mix related to economic and competitive pressures 
approximately one half of our business is generated in california  where we saw increased net rate on renewal business for consecutive months  through august we continue to see a steady level of new business submittals and our policy count in california has increased during the year ended december  we set our own premium rates in california based upon actuarial analysis of current and anticipated loss trends with a goal of maintaining underwriting profitability 
we reduced our filed premium rates in california from through due to favorable loss costs trends originating from the and legislative reforms 
due to increasing loss costs  primarily medical cost inflation  we have increased our filed premium rates by a cumulative since february premium revenues in will continue to reflect rate increases in california  rate changes increases and reductions in several of our other states  as well as competitive pressures and the continuing effects of the recession 
as we continue to execute our growth strategy  we have increased our network of independent insurance agencies by approximately in and continue to deploy our technology to make it easier for agents to do business with us 
while the effects of the recession have resulted in lower total in force payroll exposure and average policy size  we increased our in force policy count by in  including a increase during the fourth quarter 
net investment income and realized gains losses on investments we invest our holding company assets  statutory surplus  and the funds supporting our insurance liabilities  including unearned premiums and unpaid losses and lae 
we invest in fixed maturity securities  equity securities  short term investments  and cash equivalents 
net investment income includes interest and dividends earned on our invested assets and amortization of premiums and discounts on our fixed maturity securities  less bank service charges and custodial and portfolio management fees 
we have established a high quality short duration bias in our investment portfolio with high underlying credit quality of our municipal bond holdings 
the performance of our investment portfolio  with its diversified structure and quality bias  has been exceptionally strong 
net investment income decreased million for the year ended december   compared to the same period of  but increased million in  compared to the decrease in was primarily related to a decrease in average invested assets for the year 
this decrease in our average invested assets was primarily due to repayment of debt and the return of capital to stockholders through share repurchases and stockholder dividends 
the increase in net investment income for the year ended  compared to the same period of  was related to a increase in average invested assets year over year 
the average pre tax book yield on invested assets was   and at december    and  respectively 
the tax equivalent yield on invested assets was   and at december    and  respectively 
realized gains and losses on our investments are reported separately from our net investment income 
realized gains and losses on investments include the gain or loss on a security at the time of sale compared to its original cost equity securities or amortized cost fixed maturity securities 
realized losses are recognized when securities are written down as a result of an other than temporary impairment 
realized gains on investments increased million  for the year ended december   compared to the same period of we evaluated our portfolio allocation during the fourth quarter of and elected to shift million of our equity securities into a high dividend yield portfolio  which resulted in a million gain 
in  we had realized losses on investments of million 
the realized losses for were the result of other than temporary impairments on equity securities and sales of impaired fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio 
additional information regarding our investments is set forth under liquidity and capital resources investments 
combined ratio the combined ratio  expressed as a percentage  is a key measurement of underwriting profitability 
the combined ratio is the sum of the losses and lae ratio  the commission expense ratio  dividends to policyholders ratio  and underwriting and other operating expenses ratio 
when the combined ratio is below  we have recorded underwriting income  and conversely  when the combined ratio is greater than  we cannot be profitable without investment income 
because we only have one operating segment  holding company expenses are included in our calculation of the combined ratio 
the following table provides the calculation of our calendar year combined ratios for the years ended december losses and lae ratio underwriting and other operating expenses ratio commission expense ratio dividends to policyholders ratio combined ratio losses and lae ratio 
expressed as a percentage  this is the ratio of losses and lae to net premiums earned 
we analyze our losses and lae ratios on both a calendar year and accident year basis 
a calendar year losses and lae ratio is calculated by dividing the losses and lae incurred during the calendar year  regardless of when the underlying insured event occurred  by the net premiums earned during that calendar year 
the calendar year losses and lae ratio includes changes made during the calendar year in reserves for losses and lae established for insured events occurring in the current and prior years 
a calendar year losses and lae ratio is calculated using premiums and losses and lae that are net of amounts ceded to reinsurers 
the accident year losses and lae ratio  or losses and lae for insured events that occurred during a particular year divided by the premiums earned for the year  is calculated by dividing the losses and lae  regardless of when such losses and lae are incurred  for insured events that occurred during a particular year by the net premiums earned for that year 
the accident year losses and lae ratio is calculated using premiums and losses and lae that are net of amounts ceded to reinsurers 
the accident year losses and lae ratio for a particular year can decrease or increase when recalculated in subsequent periods as the reserves established for insured events occurring during that year develop favorably or unfavorably  and is an operating ratio based on our statutory financial statements and is not derived from our gaap financial informat ion 
the calendar year losses and lae ratio for a particular year will not change in future periods 
we analyze our calendar year losses and lae ratio to measure our profitability in a particular year and to evaluate the adequacy of our premium rates charged in a particular year to cover expected losses and lae from all periods  including development whether favorable or unfavorable of reserves established in prior periods 
in contrast  we analyze our accident year losses and lae ratios to evaluate our underwriting performance and the adequacy of the premium rates we charged in a particular year in relation to ultimate losses and lae from insured events occurring during that year 
the losses and lae ratios provided in this report are calendar year losses and lae ratios  except where they are expressly identified as accident year losses and lae ratios 
losses and lae expense represents our largest expense item and includes claim payments made  amortization of the lpt deferred gain  estimates for future claim payments  and changes in those estimates for current and prior periods  and costs associated with investigating  defending and adjusting claims 
the quality of our financial reporting depends in large part on accurately predicting our losses and lae  which are inherently uncertain as they are estimates of the ultimate cost of individual claims based on actuarial estimation techniques 
in california  our loss data indicates an upward trend in medical costs that is reflected in our loss reserves 
we are also seeing increased medical costs in many of our other states  partially offset by long term favorable loss cost trends in nevada 
we believe our loss reserve estimates are adequate  however  the ultimate losses will not be known with any certainty for several years 
we assume that increasing medical cost trends will continue and will impact our long term claims costs and loss reserves 
additionally  the impact  if any  of the recession on our claims costs is not yet known 
we will continue to evaluate our estimate of loss reserves to reflect the most current data and judgments 
additional information regarding our reserves for losses and lae is set forth under critical accounting policies reserve s for losses and lae 
overall  losses and lae decreased million for the year ended december   compared to the same period of  primarily due to lower payroll exposures 
favorable prior accident year loss development decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to the same period of additionally  a million expense related to the commutation of certain reinsurance treaties  and a million expense related to the write off of certain reinsurance recoverables that had previously been accounted for as an allowance for bad debt  are included in losses and lae for the year ended december  the million increase in losses and lae for the year ended december   compared to the same period of  was primarily attributable to the acquisition  partially offset by a change in overall payroll exposures  which reduced losses and lae by approximately million 
our current accident year loss estimates were   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the table below reflects the losses and lae reserve adjustments for the periods presented 
years ended quarters ended in millions prior accident year favorable development  net lpt amortization of the deferred reinsurance gain prior accident year favorable development  net  excludes a million expense related to the commutation of certain reinsurance treaties and a million expense related to the write off of certain reinsurance recoverables  which are included in losses and lae for the year ended december  excluding the impact from the lpt agreement  losses and lae would have been million  million  and million  or   and  of net premiums earned for the year ended december    and  respectively 
underwriting and other operating expenses ratio 
the underwriting and other operating expenses ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of underwriting and other operating expenses to net premiums earned  and measures an insurance company operational efficiency in producing  underwriting  and administering its insurance business 
underwriting and other operating expenses are those costs that we incur to underwrite and maintain the insurance policies we issue  excluding commission 
these expenses include premium taxes and certain other general expenses that vary with  and are primarily related to  producing new or renewal business 
other underwriting expenses include changes in estimates of future write offs of premiums receivable  general administrative expenses such as salaries and benefits  rent  office supplies  depreciation  and all other operating expenses not otherwise classified separately 
policy acquisition costs are variable based on premiums earned  however  other operating costs are more fixed in nature and become a larger percentage of net premiums earned as premiums decline 
in january  we restructured our operations as a result of the acquisition and incurred one time pre tax integration and restructuring charges of approximately million  including million of severance benefits  for the year ended december  as a result of the restructuring  we achieved pre tax cost savings of approximately million in fiscal in the first quarter of  we incurred charges of million related to staffing reductions to adjust our insurance operations to reflect activity levels at that time 
in july  we announced the reorganization of our operations to eliminate duplicative services and better align resources with business activity and growth opportunities 
we combined our four regional operating units into two units  eastern and western  with the strategic partnerships and alliances unit remaining structurally unchanged 
in connection with these efforts and with general cost control efforts  we eliminated approximately positions 
these changes to our workforce were substantially completed in the third quarter of facility closures associated with this reorganization were completed in the second half of in conjunction with this reorganization  we recorded restructuring charges of million in  including million related to workforce reductions and million related to leases for facilitie s that were vacated during the year 
beginning in  we anticipate combined annualized cost savings of approximately million  comprised of million in salaries and benefits and million in lease related savings  associated with restructuring activities that occurred in underwriting and other operating expenses decreased for the year ended december   compared to the same period of  including restructuring items for both years 
we incurred charges of million in the year ended december   including million related to workforce reductions and million related to leases for facilities that were vacated 
this compared to integration and restructuring charges of million for the same period of related to the acquisition 
excluding these restructuring charges  underwriting and other operating expenses decreased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the same period of the decrease reflects efforts to manage our expenses during a period of declining premiums 
during the year ended december  information technolog y expenses declined million and compensation expenses declined million  compared to the same period of additionally  there was a million decrease in premium taxes and a million decrease in bad debt expense 
our underwriting and other operating expenses increased  for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  including restructuring items in the increase was primarily related to the acquired operations of amcomp 
the increase included a million increase in compensation expense  a million increase in premium taxes  and million increase in bad debt expense 
commission expense ratio 
the commission expense ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of commission expense to net premiums earned and measures the cost of compensating agents and brokers for the business we have underwritten 
commission expense includes direct commissions to our agents and brokers for the premiums that they produce for us  as well as incentive payments  other marketing costs  and fees 
additionally  we are entitled to receive a contingent profit commission under the lpt agreement 
the contingent profit is an amount based on the favorable difference between actual paid losses and lae and expected paid losses and lae under the lpt agreement 
loss expenses are deemed to be of total losses paid and are paid to us as compensation for management of the lpt claims 
the calculation of actual amounts paid versus expected amounts is determined every five years beginning june  for the first twenty five years of the agreement 
the reinsurers pay us of any favorable difference between the actual and expected amounts paid at each calculati on point 
conversely  we could be required to return any previously paid contingent profit commission  plus interest  in the event of unfavorable differences 
we accrue the estimated ultimate contingent profit commission through june  increases or decreases in the estimated contingent profit commission are reflected in commission expense in the period that the estimate is revised 
in  an increase in the estimated contingent profit commission of million resulted in a decrease in the commission expense for the year 
for the year ended december   we decreased commission expenses by million as a result of an increase in contingent profit commissions and received cash payment of million from the reinsurers 
at december   expected amounts to be paid for losses under the lpt agreement for the period july  through june   were million  compared to contractually expected losses and lae of approximately million 
our commission expense was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase from to was primarily due to a million adjustment in the accrual for the lpt contingent profit commission during the year ended december  and re negotiation of the terms of a separate reinsurance agreement resulting in an additional million in commission expense in the fourth quarter of this increase was partially offset by lower net premiums earned and a million reduction in the estimate of certain administrative fees due anthem under our joint marketing agreements  which decreased the commission expense in the fourth quarter of the decrease in  compared to  of million  or  was primarily attributable to a million increase in the lpt contingent profit commission  partially offset by increased commission expense from our acquired subsidiaries 
excluding the impact of the lpt contingent profit commission  the re negotiated reinsurance agreement  and the change in accrual for fees due anthem  commission expense would have been   and of net premiums earned for the years ended december    and  respectively 
dividends to policyholders ratio 
the dividends to policyholders ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of dividends to policyholders expense to net premiums earned and measures the cost of returning premium to policyholders in the form of dividends 
in administered pricing states such as florida and wisconsin  insurance rates are set by state insurance regulators 
rate competition generally is not permitted and policyholder dividend programs are an important competitive factor in these states 
we offer dividend programs to eligible policyholders  under which a portion of the policyholders premium may be returned in the form of a dividend 
florida statutes also require the return of the portion of policyholders premiums that are deemed to be excessive profits under florida law 
we account for these payments as dividends to policyholders 
dividends to policyholders were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the decrease in dividends to policyholders from to was primarily due to lower premium levels on dividend policies in florida and wisconsin and fewer policies eligible for dividend payments in the increase in  compared to  was primarily due to the acquisition 
interest expense we incur interest expenses on notes payable 
we also had an interest rate swap agreement on our credit facility with wells fargo bank  national association wells fargo  which expired on september  interest expense decreased for the year ended december   compared to the same period of  primarily due to a million reduction in the principal balance on our credit facility with wells fargo in the fourth quarter of and the expiration of the interest rate swap in the third quarter of interest expense increased million for the year ended december   compared to the same period of  as we had no debt or related interest expense for the first ten months of income tax expense income tax expense decreased million for the year ended december   compared to the same period of similarly  income taxes decreased million for the year ended december   compared to the same period of the effective tax rates for the years ended december    and were   and  respectively 
tax exempt income as a percentage of pre tax income was   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in tax exempt income in  as a percentage of pre tax income  was primarily due to a million decrease in pre tax income  partially offset by the million lpt contingent profit commission in  which was not subject to tax 
the increase in the effective tax rate in  compared to  was primarily the result of transactions that decreased income taxes related to the final reversal of the liability for previously unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of million  including interest  and the reduction of tax exempt reserves in the amount of million 
these comparative increases were largely offset by a million decrease in pre tax income  the impact of tax exempt investment income and the lpt contingent profit commission of million  which is not subject to tax 
liquidity and capital resources parent company operating cash and short term investments 
we are a holding company and our ability to fund our operations is contingent upon our insurance subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends to the holding company 
payment of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance laws  including laws establishing minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds 
we require cash to pay stockholder dividends  repurchase common stock  make interest and principal payments on our outstanding debt obligations  fund our operating expenses  and support our growth strategy

these amounts represented the maximum dividends that could be paid without prior approval by the respective state insurance regulator 
additionally  on may   we received approval from the nevada commissioner of insurance to pay million in extraordinary dividends from eicn special surplus 
this million extraordinary dividend was paid by eicn to egi  and subsequently from egi to ehi  on june  as a result of the payment of the extraordinary dividend from special surplus  any dividends paid by eicn through june  will require prior approval by the nevada commissioner of insurance

the primary sources of cash for our insurance operating subsidiaries are funds generated from underwriting operations  investment income  and maturities of investments 
the primary uses of cash are payments of claims and operating expenses  purchases of investments  and payments of dividends to the parent holding company  which are subject to state insurance laws and regulations 
our insurance subsidiaries had total cash and fixed maturity securities of million maturing within the next months at december  we believe that our subsidiaries liquidity needs over the next months will be met with cash from operations  investment income  and maturing investments 
we purchase reinsurance to protect us against the costs of severe claims and catastrophic events 
on july   we entered into a new reinsurance program that is effective through june  the reinsurance program consists of one treaty covering excess of loss and catastrophic loss events in five layers of coverage 
our reinsurance coverage is million in excess of our million retention on a per occurrence basis  subject to a million annual aggregate deductible and certain exclusions 
we believe that our reinsurance program meets our needs and that we are sufficiently capitalized for the above described retention 
our insurance subsidiaries are required by law to maintain a certain minimum level of surplus on a statutory basis 
surplus is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total admitted assets 
the amount of capital in our insurance subsidiaries is maintained relative to standardized capital adequacy measures such as risk based capital rbc  as established by the national association of insurance commissioners 
the rbc standard was designed to provide a measure by which regulators can assess the adequacy of an insurance company s capital and surplus relative to its operations 
an insurance company must maintain capital and surplus of at least of rbc 
each of our insurance subsidiaries had total adjusted capital in excess of the minimum rbc requirements that correspond to any level of regulatory action at december  various state regulations require us to keep securities or letters of credit on deposit with the states in which we do business in depository accounts 
securities having a fair market value of million and million were on deposit at december  and  respectively 
these laws and regulations govern both the amount and type of fixed maturity security that is eligible for deposit 
additionally  certain reinsurance contracts require company funds to be held in trust for the benefit of the ceding reinsurer to secure the outstanding liabilities we assumed 
the fair value of securities held in trust for reinsurance at december  and was million and million  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  we re negotiated the terms of a reinsurance agreement with clarendon national insurance company clarendon  resulting in the release and return of funds held by clarendon to us in the amount of million 
we placed million in trust for the benefit of clarendon to support liabilities under the reinsurance agreement and invested the remaining million 
cash flows we monitor cash flows at both the consolidated and subsidiary levels 
we use trend and variance analyses to project future cash needs  making adjustments to our forecasts as appropriate 
the table below shows our net cash flows for the years ended december cash and cash equivalents provided by used in in thousands operating activities investing activities financing activities decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities increased million for the year ended december   compared to the same period of significant items increasing net cash from operations included decreased funds held of million  including the release of funds held by clarendon  decreased losses and lae paid of million  decreased underwriting and other operating expenses paid of million  including lower premium taxes paid of million  significant items decreasing net cash from operations included decreased net premiums received of million  increased restricted cash and cash equivalents of million  increased commissions paid of million  primarily due to million received from the lpt contingent profit commission in  decreased investment income received of million  and increased income taxes paid of million 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased million in  compared to this decrease was primarily due to increased payments for losses and lae of million and increase payments for underwriting and other operating expenses of million  partially offset by increased net premiums received of million  decreased income taxes paid of million  increased investment income of million  and cash received on the lpt contingent commission of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to cash provided of million in in  we had million of net cash used by investing activities 
the difference in  compared to  was primarily due to the reinvestment of funds from maturities and redemptions in the difference in  compared to  was primarily due to the purchase of amcomp for million in we also used proceeds from maturities and redemptions of investments primarily for the repurchase of our common stock in and net cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to million in in  million of net cash was provided by financing activities 
the majority of cash used in financing activities in was to repurchase million of our common stock and to pay dividends to stockholders 
in  the majority of cash used in financing activities was to repurchase million of our common stock and to pay down million of the line of credit provided by the amended credit facility 
in  cash was provided by proceeds from our amended credit facility  which was later used for the acquisition of amcomp 
investments the amortized cost of our investment portfolio was billion and the fair value was billion as of december  we employ an investment strategy that emphasizes asset quality and considers the durations of fixed maturity securities against anticipated claim payments and expenditures  other liabilities  and capital needs 
our investment portfolio is structured so that investments mature periodically in reasonable relation to current expectations of future claim payments 
currently  we make claim payments from positive cash flow from operations and use excess cash to invest in operations  invest in marketable securities  return capital to our stockholders  and fund our growth strategy 
as of december   our investment portfolio  which is classified as available for sale  consisted of fixed maturity securities whose fair values may fluctuate 
we strive to limit interest rate risk by managing the duration of our fixed maturity securities 
our fixed maturity securities excluding cash and cash equivalents had a duration of at december  to minimize interest rate risk  our portfolio is weighted toward short term and intermediate term bonds  however  our investment strategy balances consideration of duration  yield and credit risk 
our investment guidelines require that the minimum weighted average quality of our fixed maturity securities portfolio shall be aa 
as of december   our fixed maturity securities portfolio had an average quality of aa using ratings assigned by standard poor s with approximately of the market value rated aa or better 
we carry our portfolio of equity securities on our balance sheet at fair value 
we minimize our exposure to equity price risk by investing primarily in the equity securities of mid to large capitalization issuers and by diversifying our equity holdings across several industry sectors 
at december   equity securities represented of our investment portfolio 
given the economic uncertainty and continued market volatility  we believe our asset allocation best meets our strategy to preserve capital for policyholders  to provide sufficient income to support insurance operations  and to effectively grow book value over a long term investment horizon 
we seek to maximize total investment returns within the constraints of prudent portfolio management 
the asset allocation is reevaluated by the finance committee of the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
we employ conning asset management conning to act as our independent investment manager 
conning follows our written investment guidelines based upon strategies approved by the board of directors 
in addition to the construction and management of the portfolio  we utilize the investment advisory services of conning 
these services include investment accounting and company modeling using dynamic financial analysis dfa 
the dfa tool is utilized to develop portfolio targets and objectives  which in turn are used in constructing an optimal portfolio

we regularly assess individual securities as part of our ongoing portfolio management  including the identification of other than temporary declines in fair value 
our other than temporary assessment includes reviewing the extent and duration of declines in fair value of investments below amortized cost  historical and projected financial performance and near term prospects of the issuer  the outlook for industry sectors  credit rating  and macro economic changes 
we also make a determination as to whether it is not more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the security before its fair value recovers above cost  or to maturity 
for the year ended december   we recognized an impairment of thousand in the fair value of one of our fixed maturity holdings as a result of an anticipated sale of this security due to a strategic rebalancing in our investment portfolio and not from credit impairment 
none of our equity securities were impaired in we determined that the unrealized losses on equity securities at december  were not considered to be other than temporary due to the financial condition and the near term prospects of the issuers 
we also determined that the remaining unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities were primarily the result of prevailing interest rates and not the credit quality of the issuers 
for the year ended december   we recognized an impairment of million in the fair value of equity securities in our investment portfolio 
the impairment was recognized as a result of the severity and duration of the decline in the market values of these securities primarily due to market conditions

the losses and lae reserves are presented gross of our reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses  which were as follows for each of the periods presented above recoveries due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands reinsurance recoverables estimated losses and lae reserve payment patterns have been computed based on historical information 
our calculation of loss and lae reserve payments by period is subject to the same uncertainties associated with determining the level of reserves and to the additional uncertainties arising from the difficulty of predicting when claims including claims that have not yet been reported to us will be paid 
for a discussion of our reserving process  see critical accounting policies reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
actual payments of losses and lae by period will vary  perhaps materially  from the above table to the extent that current estimates of losses and lae reserves vary from actual ultimate claims amounts due to variations between expected and actual payout patterns 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires both the use of estimates and judgment relative to the application of appropriate accounting policies 
our accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  but we believe that the following matters are particularly important to an understanding of our financial statements because changes in these estimates or changes in the assumptions used to make them could have a material impact on the results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
reserves for losses and lae accounting for workers compensation insurance requires us to estimate the liability for the expected ultimate cost of unpaid losses and lae loss reserves as of a balance sheet date 
loss reserve estimates are inherently uncertain because the ultimate amount we pay for many of the claims we have incurred as of the balance sheet date will not be known for many years 
our estimate of loss reserves is intended to equal the difference between the expected ultimate losses and lae of all claims that have occurred as of a balance sheet date and amounts already paid 
we establish loss reserves based on our own analysis of emerging claims experience and environmental conditions in our markets and review of the results of various actuarial projections 
our aggregate carried reserve for unpaid losses and lae is the sum of our reserves for each accident year point estimate and represents our best estimate of outstanding loss reserves 
the amount by which estimated losses in the aggregate  measured subsequently by reference to payments and additional estimates  differ from those previously estimated for a specific time period is known as reserve development 
reserve development is unfavorable when losses ultimately settle for more than the amount reserved or subsequent estimates indicate a basis for reserve increases on open claims  causing the previously estimated loss reserves to be deficient 
reserve development is favorable when estimates of ultimate losses indicate a decrease in established reserves  causing the previously estimated loss reserves to be redundant 
development is reflected in our operating results through an adjustment to incurred losses and lae during the period in which it is recognized 
although claims for which reserves are established may not be paid for several years or more  we do not discount loss reserves in our financial statements for the time value of money 
the three main components of our reserves for unpaid losses and lae are case reserves  incurred but not reported ibnr reserves  and lae reserves 
when losses are reported to us  we establish  individually  estimates of the ultimate cost of the claims case reserves 
these case reserves are continually monitored and revised in response to new information and for amounts paid 
ibnr is an actuarial estimate of future payments on claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to us 
in addition to this provision for late reported claims  we also estimate  and make a provision for  the extent to which the case reserves on known claims may develop and for additional payments on closed claims  known as reopening 
ibnr reserves apply to the entire body of claims arising from a specific time period  rather than a specific claim 
most of our ibnr reserves relate to estimated future claim payments on recorded open claims 
workers compensation claims are generally reported to the employer and to the insurance company relatively quickly and relatively small amounts are paid on claims that have already been closed 
consequently  late reporting and reopening of claims are a less significant part of ibnr for our insurance subsidiaries 
lae reserves are our estimate of the future expenses of investigating  administering  and settling claims  including legal expenses that will be paid to manage claims that have occurred 
lae reserves are established in the aggregate  rather than on a claim by claim basis 
a portion of our obligations for losses and lae are ceded to unaffiliated reinsurers 
the amount of reinsurance that will be recoverable on our losses and lae reserves includes both the reinsurance recoverable from our excess of loss reinsurance policies  as well as reinsurance recoverable under the terms of the lpt agreement 
our reserve for unpaid losses and lae gross and net of reinsurance  including the main components of such reserves  were as follows as of december in thousands case reserves ibnr lae gross unpaid losses and lae less reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses and lae  gross net unpaid losses and lae actuarial methodologies are used by workers compensation insurance companies  including us  to analyze and estimate the aggregate amount of unpaid losses and lae 
as mentioned above  management considers the results of various actuarial projection methods and their underlying assumptions  among other factors  in establishing reserves for unpaid losses and lae 
judgment is required in the actuarial estimation of loss reserves  including the selection of various actuarial methodologies to project the following the ultimate cost of claims  the selection of projection parameters based on historical company data  industry data  and other benchmarks  the identification and quantification of potential changes in parameters from historical levels to current and future levels due to changes in future claims development expectations  and the weighting of differing reserve indications resulting from alternative methods and assumptions 
the adequacy of our ultimate loss reserves is inherently uncertain and represents a significant risk to our business 
we attempt to mitigate this risk through our claims management process and by monitoring and reacting to statistics relating to the cost and duration of claims 
we retain an independent actuarial consulting firm consulting actuary to perform comprehensive studies of our losses and lae liability on a semi annual basis 
the role of our consulting actuary is to conduct sufficient analyses to produce a range of reasonable estimates  as well as a point estimate  of our unpaid losses and lae liability  and to present those results to our actuarial staff and to management 
in  we changed our consulting actuary 
prior to this change  the consulting actuary based its point estimate for eicn strictly on the basis of paid loss development methods 
beginning in  our new consulting actuary determined its point estimate for eicn based on a combination of methodologies  similar to those utilized for our other insurance subsidiaries  as described below 
while such a determination  based on a combination of methodologies is valid  this change in methodologies prevents any direct year over year comparison of the consulting actuaries point estimates 
the new consulting actuary has provided us with a separate calculation for eicn that is based strictly on the historically utilized paid loss methods for and this calculation in combination with th e new consulting actuary s point estimate for our other insurance subsidiaries allows for comparability of our overall carried reserves  relative to the previous consulting actuary s calculations 
management believes that using strictly paid loss methods for nevada losses is the preferred approach given our depth of knowledge of nevada losses and the consistency of paid data over time resulting from and related to the statutory prohibition of entering into full and final settlements of nevada claims 
we compile and aggregate our claims data by grouping the claims according to the year or quarter in which the claim occurred accident year or accident quarter when analyzing claim payment and emergence patterns and trends over time 
additionally  claims data is aggregated and compiled separately for different types of claims or claimant benefits  or for different states or groups of states in which we do business  or both 
our internal actuaries and the consulting actuary prepare reserve estimates for all accident years using our own historical claims data and many of the generally accepted actuarial methodologies for estimating loss reserves  such as paid loss development methods  incurred loss development methods  and bornhuetter ferguson methods 
these methods vary in their responsiveness to different information  characteristics and dynamics in the data  and the results assist the actuary in considering these characteristics and dynamics in the historical data 
the methods employed for each segment of claims data  and the relative weight accorded to each method  vary depending on the nature of the claims segment and on the age of the claims 
each actuarial methodology requires the selection and application of various parameters and assumptions 
the key parameters and assumptions include the pattern with which our aggregate claims data will be paid or will emerge over time  claims cost inflation rates  the effects of legislative benefit changes and or judicial changes  and trends in the frequency of claims  both overall and by severity of claim 
we believe the pattern with which our aggregate claims data will be paid or emerge over time and claims cost inflation rates are the most important parimeters and assumptions 
in nevada  one method involves adjusting historical data for inflation 
the inflation rates used in the analysis are judgmentally selected based on historical year to year movements in the cost of claims observed in our insurance subsidiaries data and industry wide data  as well as on broader inflation indices 
the results of this method would differ if different inflation rates were selected 
in projections using december  data  the method that uses explicit medical cost inflation assumptions included medical cost inflation assumptions ranging from to 
the selection of medical cost inflation assumptions used has been based on observed recent and longer term historical medical cost inflation in our claims data and in the us economy more generally 
the rate of medical cost inflation  as reflected in our historical medical payments per claim  has averaged approximately over the past ten years 
the rate of medical cost inflation in the general us economy  as measured by the consumer price index medical care  has averaged approximately over the past ten years 
management along with internal actuarial staff and the consulting actuary separately analyze lae and estimate unpaid lae 
these analyses rely primarily on examining the relationship between the aggregate amounts that have been spent on lae historically  compared with the volume of claims activity for the corresponding historical calendar periods 
the portion of unpaid lae that will be recoverable from reinsurers is estimated based on the contractual reinsurance terms 
the range of estimates of loss reserves produced by the consulting actuary is intended to represent the range in which it is most likely that the ultimate losses will fall 
this range is narrower than the range of indications produced by the individual methods applied because it is not likely that the high or low result will emerge for every claim segment and accident year 
the consulting actuary s point estimate of loss reserves is based on a judgmental selection for each claim segment from within the range of results indicated by the different actuarial methods 
management formally establishes loss reserves for financial statement purposes on a quarterly basis 
in doing so  we make reference to the most current analyses of our consulting actuary  including a review of the assumptions and the results of the various actuarial methods used 
comprehensive studies are conducted as of june and december by both internal actuarial staff and the consulting actuary 
on the alternate quarters  the preceding study results are updated for actual claim payment activity during the quarter 
the aggregate carried reserve calculated by management represents our best estimate of our outstanding unpaid losses and lae 
we believe that we should be conservative in our reserving practices due to the long tail nature of workers compensation claims payouts  the susceptibility of those future payments to unpredictable external forces such as medical cost inflation and other economic conditions  and the actual variability of loss reserve adequacy that we have observed in the workers compensation insurance industry 
in establishing management s best estimate of unpaid losses and lae at december for the last three years  management and internal actuarial staff reviewed and considered the following a the consulting actuary assumptions  point estimate  and range  b the inherent uncertainty of workers compensation liabilities for unpaid losses and lae  and c the particular uncertainties associated with the potential for legislative and or judicial reversal of california and florida reforms  and the degree of movement observed in eicn prior years projections of losses and lae in nevada following premium and market share reductions 
management did not quantify a specific loss reserve increment for each uncertainty  but rather established an overall provision for loss reserves that represented management s best estimate of unpai d losses and lae in light of the historical data  actuarial assumptions  point estimate and range  and current facts and circumstances 
management continued to use a range and point estimate for eicn  based on paid loss methods  which our experience in nevada indicates is more appropriate 
management s best estimate of unpaid losses and lae  net of reinsurance  was million  million  and million above the value calculated based on the historically utilized paid loss methods for eicn and a combination of methodologies for our other insurance subsidiaries at december    and  respectively 
the table below provides the actuarial range of estimated liabilities for net unpaid losses and lae and our carried reserves as of december in thousands low end of actuarial range carried reserves high end of actuarial range each of the actuarial methods used in the analysis and estimation of loss reserves depend in part on the selection of an expected pattern with which the aggregate claims data will be paid or will emerge over time  and the assumption that this expected pattern will prevail into the future 
we select relevant patterns as part of the periodic review and projection of unpaid losses and lae 
in selecting these patterns  we examine long and short term historical data for our insurance subsidiaries  benchmarks based on industry data  and forecasts made by industry rating bureaus regarding the effect of legislative benefit changes on these patterns 
the following table reconciles the beginning and ending loss reserves as of december in thousands unpaid losses and lae  gross of reinsurance  at beginning of period less reinsurance recoverable  excluding bad debt allowance  on unpaid losses and lae unpaid losses and lae net unpaid losses and lae at beginning of period losses and lae  net of reinsurance  acquired in business combination losses and lae  net of reinsurance  incurred in current year prior years total net losses and lae incurred during the period deduct payments for losses and lae  net of reinsurance  related to current year prior years total net payments for losses and lae during the period ending unpaid losses and lae  net of reinsurance reinsurance recoverable  excluding bad debt allowance  on unpaid losses and lae unpaid losses and lae unpaid losses and lae  gross of reinsurance  at end of period estimates of incurred losses and lae attributable to insured events for prior years have decreased due to continued favorable development in such prior accident years 
the major sources of favorable development include actual paid losses that have been less than expected and the impact of new information on selected patterns of claims emergence and payment used in the projection of future loss payments 
new information includes our own data regarding patterns of claims emergence  development and payment that have been observed in the most recent periods  and external information regarding the workers compensation environments in the states in which we operate 
as of december   california and nevada represented approximately of our reserves for unpaid losses and lae on our consolidated balance sheet 
in california  where our operations began in  the actuaries and management initial expectations of the ultimate level of losses and patterns of loss emergence and payment were based on benchmarks derived from analyses of historical insurance industry data in california 
no historical data from our california insurance subsidiary existed prior to july   however  some historical data was available for the prior years for some of the market segments we entered in california  but was limited as to the number of loss reserve evaluation points available 
the industry based benchmarks were judgmentally adjusted for the anticipated impact of significant environmental changes  specifically the enactment of major changes to the statutory workers compensation benefit structure and the manner in which claims are administered and adjudicated in california 
the actual emergence and payment of claims by our california insurance subsidiary has been more favorable than those initial expectations through  due at least in part to the impact of enactment of the major changes in the california workers compensation environment  however  our recent loss experience  beginning in  indicates an upward trend in medical costs that is reflected in our loss reserves 
we assume that increasing medical cost trends will continue and will impact our long term claims costs and loss reserves 
at each evaluation date  the projected claim activity underlying prior loss reserves is replaced by actual claim activity  and the expectation of future emergence and payment of california claims underlying the actuarial projections is reevaluated based on our insurance subsidiaries emerging experience and on updating the benchmarks that are derived from observing and analyzing the insurance industry data for california workers compe nsation 
we have also seen a significant improvement in claims emergence and payment patterns in nevada in recent years  and have given these improved patterns significant weight in establishing loss reserves for our nevada business 
if future emergence in nevada more closely resembles long term historical patterns of the nevada state industrial insurance system the fund  our current loss reserves could develop unfavorably over time 
additionally  the impact  if any  of the recession on our claim costs is not yet known 
we will continue to evaluate our estimate of loss reserves to reflect the most current data and judgments 
in nevada  we have compiled a lengthy history of workers compensation claims payment patterns based on the business of the fund and eicn  but the emergence and payment of claims in recent years has been more favorable than in the long term history in nevada with the fund 
the expected patterns of claim payments and emergence used in the projection of our ultimate claim payments are based on both long and short term historical data 
in recent evaluations  claim patterns have continued to emerge in a manner consistent with short term historical data 
consequently  our selection of claim projection patterns has relied more heavily on patterns observed in recent years 
our insurance subsidiaries have been operating in a period of drastically changing environmental conditions in our major markets  entry into new markets  and operational changes 
during periods characterized by such changes  at each evaluation  the actuaries and management must make judgments as to the relative weight to accord to long term historical and recent company data  external data  evaluations of environmental and operational changes  and other factors in selecting the methods to use in projecting ultimate losses and lae  the parameters to incorporate in those methods  and the relative weights to accord to the different projection indications 
at each evaluation  management has given weight to new data  recent indications  and evaluations of environmental conditions and changes that implicitly reflect management s expect ation as to the degree to which the future will resemble the most recent information and most recent changes  compared with long term claim payment  claims emergence  and claim cost inflation patterns 
more than of our claims payments during the three years ended december  related to medical care for injured workers 
the utilization and cost of medical services in the future is a significant source of uncertainty in the establishment of loss reserves for workers compensation 
our loss reserves are established based on reviewing the results of actuarial methods  some of which do not contain explicit medical claim cost inflation rates  however  because medical care may be provided to an injured worker over many years  and in some cases decades  the pace of medical claim cost inflation has a significant impact on our ultimate claim payments 
for example  if the rate of medical claim cost inflation increases by above the inflation rate that is implicitly included in the loss reserves at december   we estimate that future medical costs over the lifetime of current claims would increase by approximately million on a net of reinsurance basis 
our reserve estimates reflect expected increases in the costs of contested claims  but do not assume any losses resulting from significant new legal liability theories 
our reserve estimates also assume that there will not be significant future changes in the regulatory and legislative environment 
in the event of significant new legal liability theories or new regulation or legislation  we will attempt to quantify its impact on our business 
the range of estimates of unpaid losses and lae produced by our actuarial reviews of medical cost inflation data provide some indication of the potential variability of future losses and lae payments  however  the full range of potential variation is difficult to estimate because our insurance subsidiaries do not have a lengthy operating history in many of the states in which we now operate 
if the actual unpaid losses and lae were at the high or the low end of the actuarial range  the impact on our financial results would have been as follows december  increase decrease in reserves in thousands at low end of range at high end of range increase decrease in equity and net income  net of income tax effect at low end of range at high end of range actual losses are affected by a more complex combination of forces and dynamics than any one model or actuarial methodology can represent  and each methodology is an approximation of these complex forces and dynamics 
none of the methods are designed or intended to produce an indication that is systematically higher or lower than the other methods 
at any given evaluation date  some of the actuarial projection methods produce indications outside the consulting actuary s selected range 
accordingly  we believe that the range of potential outcomes is considerably wider than the actuarially estimated range of the most likely outcomes 
we have decreased our prior years reserves for unpaid losses and lae million  million  and million as of december    and  respectively  illustrating that changes in estimates of loss reserves can be significant from year to year 
we have no basis for anticipating whether actual future payments of losses and lae may be either greater than or less than the reserve for unpaid losses and lae on our current balance sheet 
reinsurance recoverables reinsurance recoverables represent a amounts currently due from reinsurers on paid losses and lae  b amounts recoverable from reinsurers on case basis estimates of reported losses  and c amounts recoverable from reinsurers on actuarial estimates of ibnr for losses and lae 
these recoverables are based on our current estimates of the underlying losses and lae  and are reported on our consolidated balance sheets separately as assets  as reinsurance does not relieve us of our legal liability to policyholders 
we bear credit risk with respect to the reinsurers  which can be significant considering that some of the unpaid losses and lae remain outstanding for an extended period of time 
reinsurers may refuse or fail to pay losses that we cede to them  or they might delay payment 
we are required to pay losses even if a reinsurer refu ses or fails to meet its obligations under the applicable reinsurance agreement 
we continually monitor the financial condition and rating agency ratings of our reinsurers 
no material amounts due from reinsurers have been written off as uncollectible since our inception in  and we believe that amounts currently reflected in our consolidated financial statements will similarly not require any material prospective adjustment 
under the lpt agreement  the fund initially ceded billion in liabilities for the incurred but unpaid losses and lae related to claims incurred prior to july   for consideration of million in cash 
the estimated remaining liabilities subject to the lpt agreement were million as of december  losses and lae paid with respect to the lpt agreement totaled million at december  we account for the lpt agreement as retroactive reinsurance 
entry into the lpt agreement resulted in a deferred reinsurance gain that was recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as a liability 
this deferred gain is being amortized using the recovery method  whereby the amortization is determined by the proportion of actual reinsurance recoveries to total estimated recoveries  and the amortization is reflected in l osses and lae 
in addition  we are entitled to receive a contingent commission under the lpt agreement 
changes in the estimated contingent commission are reflected in our commission expense in the period that the estimate is revised 
recognition of premium revenue premium revenue is recognized over the period of the contract in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided 
at the end of the policy term  payroll based premium audits are performed on substantially all policyholder accounts to determine net premiums earned for the policy year 
earned but unbilled premiums include estimated future audit premiums based on our historical experience 
these estimates are subject to changes in policyholders payrolls  economic conditions  and seasonality  and are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops or new information becomes known 
any such adjustments are included in current operations 
no material adjustments have been made to our accrual for earned but unbilled premium since our inception in although considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  we bel ieve that amounts currently reflected in our consolidated financial statements will similarly not require any material prospective adjustment 
income taxes our accounting for income taxes considers the current and deferred tax consequences of all transactions that have been recognized in the financial statements using the provisions of enacted tax laws 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from a tax rate change affects our net income or loss in the period that includes the enactment date of the tax rate change 
our income tax returns are subject to audit by the internal revenue service and various state tax authorities 
significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the ti ming and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions because of differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations 
we periodically evaluate our exposures associated with tax filing positions 
although we believe our positions comply with applicable laws  we record liabilities based upon estimates of the ultimate outcomes of these matters 
in assessing whether our deferred tax assets will be realized  we consider whether it is more likely than not that we will generate future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies  and projected future taxable income in making this assessment 
if necessary  we establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
in  we reversed million of a remaining liability for unrecognized tax benefits  including million in interest  as certain statutory periods had expired 
the reversal of the liability caused a decrease in our tax expense and effective tax rate in valuation of investments our investments in fixed maturity and equity securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in a separate component of equity  net of deferred taxes  as a component of net accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
realized gains and losses on sales of investments are recognized in operations on the specific identification basis

impairment of an investment security results in a reduction of the carrying value of the security and the realization of a loss when the fair value of the security declines below our cost or amortized cost  as applicable  and the impairment is deemed to be other than temporary 
we regularly review our investment portfolio to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other than temporary declines in the fair value of our investments 
we consider various factors in determining if a decline in the fair value of an individual security is other than temporary 
some of the factors we consider include how long and by how much the fair value of the security has been below its cost or amortized cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer of the security  including any specific events that may affect its operations or earnings  the outlook for industry sectors and macro economic changes  that it is not more likely than not that we will not be required to sell the securities until its fair value recovers above cost  or to maturity  any downgrades of the security by a rating agency  any reduction or elimination of dividends  or nonpayment of scheduled interest payments  and our intent to hold or sell the security 
the amount of any write downs is determined by the difference between cost or amortized cost of the investment and its fair value at the time the other than temporary decline was identified 
goodwill and other intangible assets we prepare a valuation analysis for goodwill and other intangible assets  whereby we identify whether events have occurred that may impact the carrying value of these assets and make assumptions regarding future events  such as cash flows and profitability 
differences between the assumptions used to prepare these valuations and actual results could materially impact the carrying amount of these assets and our operating results 
new accounting standards as of december   there was recently issued accounting guidance that we either implemented during the year or will implement in future periods 
none of this guidance that has been implemented had  or is expected to have  a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operation  however  we have not yet determined the effect certain pronouncements that will be implemented in future periods will have on our financial statements 
see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the major components of market risk affecting us are credit risk  interest rate risk  and equity price risk 
credit risk our fixed maturity securities portfolio is exposed to credit risk  which we attempt to manage through issuer and industry diversification 
our investment guidelines include limitations on the minimum rating of fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio  as well as restrictions on investments in fixed maturity securities of a single issuer 
we also bear credit risk with respect to the reinsurers  which can be significant considering that some of the unpaid losses and lae remain outstanding for an extended period of time 
we are required to pay losses even if a reinsurer refuses or fails to meet its obligations under the applicable reinsurance agreement 
we continually monitor the financial condition and rating agency ratings of our reinsurers 
interest rate risk investments the fair value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk  the risk of loss in fair value resulting from changes in prevailing interest rates  which we strive to limit by managing duration 
our investments excluding cash and cash equivalents had a duration of at december  to minimize interest rate risk  our portfolio is weighted toward short term and intermediate term bonds  however  our investment strategy balances consideration of duration  yield and credit risk 
we continually monitor the impact of interest rate changes on our liquidity obligations 
sensitivity analysis the fair values or cash flows of market sensitive instruments are subject to potential losses in future earnings resulting from changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices 
our sensitivity analysis model uses a hypothetical change in market rates that reflects what we believe are reasonably possible near term changes in those rates covering a period of time going forward up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from the hypothetical change in market rates assumed in this disclosure 
this sensitivity analysis does not reflect the results of any action that we may take to mitigate such hypothetical losses in fair value 
we use fair values to measure our potential loss in this model  which includes fixed maturity securities and short term investments 
for invested assets  we use modified duration modeling to calculate changes in fair values 
durations on invested assets are adjusted for call  put  and interest rate reset features 
invested asset portfolio durations are calculated on a market value weighted basis  excluding accrued investment income  using holdings as of december  the estimated changes in fair values on our fixed maturity securities including short term investments  valued at billion as of december   based on specific changes in interest rates are as follows changes in interest rates estimated increase decrease in fair value in thousands  except percentages basis point rise basis point rise basis point rise basis point decline basis point decline this model produces a predicted pre tax loss in fair value of market sensitive instruments of million  or  resulting from a basis point increase in interest rates as of december  the most significant assessment of the effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on investment income would be based on fasb guidance related to accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases  which requires amortization adjustments for mortgage backed securities 
the rates at which the mortgages underlying mortgage backed securities are prepaid  and therefore the average life of mortgage backed securities  can vary depending on changes in interest rates for example  mortgages are prepaid faster and the average life of mortgage backed securities falls when interest rates decline 
adjustments for changes in amortization are based on revised average life assumptions and would have an impact on investment income if a significant portion of our mortgage backed securities were purchased at significant discounts or premiums to par value 
as of december   the par value of our mortgage backed securities holdings was million 
amortized cost is of par value 
since a majority of our mortgage backed securities were purchased at a premium or discount that is significant as a percentage of par  an adjustment could have a significant effect on investment income  however  given the current econom ic conditions and prevailing interest rate environment  the rate of prepayments is unlikely to accelerate 
the mortgage backed securities portion of the portfolio totaled of total investments as of december  agency backed mortgage pass throughs totaled million  or  of the mortgage backed securities portion of the portfolio  and of the total portfolio as of december  equity price risk equity price risk is the risk that we may incur losses in the fair value of the equity securities we hold in our available for sale investment portfolio 
adverse changes in the market prices of the equity securities we hold in our investment portfolio would result in decreases in the fair value of our total assets 
we minimize our exposure to equity price risk by investing primarily in the equity securities of mid to large capitalization issuers and by diversifying our equity holdings across several industry sectors 
at december   equity securities had a fair value of million  or of our investment portfolio 
the table below shows the sensitivity of our equity securities to price changes as of december  cost fair value fair value decrease pre tax impact on total equity securities fair value increase pre tax impact on total equity securities in thousands total domestic equities effects of inflation inflation could impact our financial statements and results of operations 
our estimates for losses and lae include assumptions about future payments for closure of claims and claims handling expenses  such as medical treatments and litigation costs 
to the extent inflation causes these costs to increase above established reserves  we will be required to increase those reserves for losses and lae  reducing our earnings in the period in which the deficiency is identified 
we consider inflation in the reserving process by reviewing cost trends and our historical reserving results 
we also consider an estimate of increased costs in determining the adequacy of our rates  particularly as it relates to medical and hospital rates where historical inflation rates have exceeded general inflation rates 
fluctuations in rates of inflation also influence interest rates  which in turn impact the market value of our investment portfolio and yields on new investments 
operating expenses  including payrolls  are also impacted to a certain degree by inflation
