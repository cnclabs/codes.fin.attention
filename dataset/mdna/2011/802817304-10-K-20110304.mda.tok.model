table of contents rhucin recombinant human c inhibitor is a recombinant version of the human protein c inhibitor  which is produced using proprietary transgenic technology 
in december  our licensing partner  pharming group nv  or pharming  submitted a biologics license application  or bla  to the us food and drug administration  or fda  seeking approval to market rhucin for the treatment of acute attacks of hereditary angioedema  or hae  an orphan disease 
on february   based on prior discussions with the fda  pharming announced initiation of a placebo controlled  double blind phase iiib clinical study with approximately patients to provide additional data in support of the u kg dose 
on february   pharming announced receipt of a refusal to file letter from the fda for the rhucin bla 
in the letter the fda indicated that the bla was not sufficiently complete to enable a critical medical review and indicated that the fda will provide additional feedback on the design of the ongoing phase iiib clinical study 
in addition  the fda requested that the results of the phase iiib clinical study be included in any future bla submission for rhucin 
both we and pharming intend to meet with the fda at the earliest opportunity to discuss the issues raised in the fda letter and to reach a more comprehensive understanding of what would be required for the bla to be accepted for review 
in addition  a phase ii proof of concept study is planned to evaluate recombinant human c inhibitor for the treatment of early antibody mediated rejection  or amr  in renal transplant patients 
we have rights to rhucin in the us  canada and mexico under our under license and supply agreements with pharming

we have rights to rifamycin sv mmx in the us under a strategic collaboration with cosmo 
san anti vla antibody is a novel early stage anti vla monoclonal antibody  or mab  development compound that we initially expect to develop for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis 
we are planning to begin a single center  randomized  placebo controlled  single dose  dose escalation phase i clinical study with san in march april we have worldwide rights to san under a license agreement with biogen idec ma  or biogen  and in connection with our acquisition of covella pharmaceuticals  inc  or covella

in addition  we have licensed certain exclusive rights to norgine bv  or norgine  to develop  manufacture and commercialize prescription immediate release omeprazole products in specified markets in europe and in israel 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

table of contents principles of consolidation our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of santarus and its wholly owned subsidiary  covella 
we do not have any interest in variable interest entities 
all material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 
in september  we acquired the worldwide rights to san through the acquisition of covella pursuant to the terms of a merger agreement 
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement  covella survived as our wholly owned subsidiary 
business combinations we accounted for the acquisition of covella in accordance with the revised authoritative guidance for business combinations 
this guidance establishes principles and requirements for recognizing and measuring the total consideration transferred to and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquired target in a business combination 
the consideration paid to acquire covella was required to be measured at fair value and included cash consideration  the issuance of our common stock and contingent consideration  which includes our obligation to make clinical and regulatory milestone payments based on success in developing product candidates in addition to a royalty on net sales of any commercial products resulting from the anti vla mab technology 
after the total consideration transferred was calculated by determining the fair value of the contingent consideration plus the upfront cash and stock consideration  we assigned the purchase price of covella to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
this allocation of the purchase price resulted in recognition of intangible assets related to in process research and development  or ipr d  and goodwill 
the determination and allocation of the consideration transferred requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at the acquisition date with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration 
the key assumptions in determining the fair value were the discount rate and the probability assigned to the potential milestone or royalty being achieved 
we remeasure the fair value of the contingent consideration at each reporting period  with any change in its fair value being recorded in the current period s operating expenses 
changes in the fair value may result from either the passage of time or events occurring after the acquisition date  such as changes in the estimate of the probability of achieving the milestone or royalty 
intangible assets and goodwill our intangible assets are comprised primarily of acquired ipr d and license agreements 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired from business combinations 
we periodically assess the carrying value of our intangible assets and goodwill  which requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the future cash flows of these assets 
the assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances the asset s ability to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset s  and the impact of significant negative industry  regulatory or economic trends 
ipr d will not be amortized until the related development process is complete and goodwill is not amortized 
license agreements and other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value is determined by a combination of third party sources and forecasted discounted cash flows 
in addition  we base the useful lives and related amortization expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used 
we also periodically review the lives assigned to our intangible assets to ensure that our initial estimates do not exceed any revised estimated periods from which we expect to realize cash flows from the technologies 
a change in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates could result in an impairment charge which could negatively impact our results of operations 
we have not recognized any impairment charges on our intangible assets or goodwill through december  
table of contents inventories and related reserves inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market net realizable value 
cost is determined by the first in  first out method 
inventories consist of finished goods and raw materials used in the manufacture of cycloset tablets  zegerid capsules and the related authorized generic product and zegerid powder for oral suspension 
also included in inventories are product samples of the glumetza products which we purchase from depomed under our promotion agreement 
we provide reserves for potentially excess  dated or obsolete inventories based on an analysis of inventory on hand and on firm purchase commitments compared to forecasts of future sales 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  title has passed  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
product sales  net 
we sell our cycloset and zegerid products primarily to pharmaceutical wholesale distributors 
we are obligated to accept from customers products that are returned within six months of their expiration date or up to months beyond their expiration date 
we authorize returns for expired or damaged products in accordance with our return goods policy and procedures 
we issue credit to the customer for expired or damaged returned product 
we rarely exchange product from inventory for returned product 
at the time of sale  we record our estimates for product returns as a reduction to revenue at full sales value with a corresponding increase in the allowance for product returns liability 
actual returns are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for product returns liability at sales value with a corresponding decrease in accounts receivable for credit issued to the customer 
we recognize product sales net of estimated allowances for product returns  estimated rebates in connection with contracts relating to managed care  medicare  and patient coupons  and estimated chargebacks from distributors  wholesaler fees and prompt payment and other discounts 
we establish allowances for estimated product returns  rebates and chargebacks based primarily on the following qualitative and quantitative factors the number of and specific contractual terms of agreements with customers  estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel  estimated remaining shelf life of products  analysis of prescription data gathered by a third party prescription data provider  direct communication with customers  historical product returns  rebates and chargebacks  anticipated introduction of competitive products or generics  anticipated pricing strategy changes by us and or our competitors  and the impact of state and federal regulations 
in our analyses  we utilize prescription data purchased from a third party data provider to develop estimates of historical inventory channel pull through 
we utilize a separate analysis which compares historical product shipments less returns to estimated historical prescriptions written 
based on that analysis  we develop an estimate of the quantity of product in the distribution channel which may be subject to various product return  rebate and chargeback exposures 
our estimates of product returns  rebates and chargebacks require our most subjective and complex judgment due to the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual future payments for returns  rebates  chargebacks and other discounts exceed the estimates we made at the time of sale  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would be negatively impacted 
our allowance for product returns was million as of december  and million as of december  we recognize product sales at the time title passes to our customers  and we provide for an estimate of future product returns at that time based upon historical product returns trends  analysis of product expiration dating and estimated inventory levels in the distribution channel  review of returns trends for similar products  if available  and the other factors discussed above 
there may be a significant time lag between the date we determine the estimated allowance and when we receive the product return and issue credit to a customer 
due 
table of contents to this time lag  we record adjustments to our estimated allowance over several periods  which can result in a net increase or a net decrease in our operating results in those periods 
we have been tracking our zegerid product returns history by individual production batches from the time of our first commercial product launch of zegerid powder for oral suspension mg in late  taking into consideration product expiration dating and estimated inventory levels in the distribution channel 
we launched cycloset in november and have not experienced any returns through december  we have provided for an estimate of cycloset product returns based upon our review of returns trends for similar products and taking into consideration our zegerid product returns history 
our allowance for rebates  chargebacks and other discounts was million as of december  and million as of december  these allowances reflect an estimate of our liability for rebates due to managed care organizations under specific contracts  rebates due to various organizations under medicare contracts and regulations  chargebacks due to various organizations purchasing our products through federal contracts and or group purchasing agreements  and other rebates and customer discounts due in connection with wholesaler fees and prompt payment and other discounts 
we estimate our liability for rebates and chargebacks at each reporting period based on a combination of the qualitative and quantitative assumptions listed above 
in each reporting period  we evaluate our outstanding contracts and apply the contractual discounts to the invoiced price of wholesaler shipments recognized 
although the total invoiced price of shipments to wholesalers for the reporting period and the contractual terms are known during the reporting period  we project the ultimate disposition of the sale eg future utilization rates of cash payors  managed care  medicare or other contracted organizations 
this estimate is based on historical trends adjusted for anticipated changes based on specific contractual terms of new agreements with customers  anticipated pricing strategy changes by us and or our competitors and the other qualitative and quantitative factors described above 
there may be a significant time lag between the date we determine the estimated allowance and when we make the contractual payment or issue credit to a customer 
due to this time lag  we record adjustments to our estimated allowance over several periods  which can result in a net increase or a net decrease in our operating results in those periods 
in late june  we began selling an authorized generic version of our prescription zegerid capsules under a distribution and supply agreement with prasco 
prasco has agreed to purchase all of its authorized generic product requirements from us and pays a specified invoice supply price for such products 
we recognize revenue from shipments to prasco at the invoice supply price and the related cost of product sales when title transfers  which is generally at the time of shipment 
we are also entitled to receive a percentage of the gross margin on sales of the authorized generic products by prasco  which we recognize as an addition to product sales  net when prasco reports to us the gross margin from the ultimate sale of the products 
any adjustments to the gross margin related to prasco s estimated sales discounts and other deductions are recognized in the period prasco reports the amounts to us 
promotion  royalty and other license revenue 
we analyze each element of our promotion and licensing agreements to determine the appropriate revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on upfront payments over the period of significant involvement under the related agreements unless the fee is in exchange for products delivered or services rendered that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process and no further performance obligation exists under the contract 
we recognize milestone payments upon the achievement of specified milestones if the milestone is substantive in nature  and the achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement and the fees are nonrefundable 
any milestone payments received prior to satisfying these revenue recognition criteria are recognized as deferred revenue 
sales milestones  royalties and promotion fees are based on sales and or gross margin information  which may include estimates of sales discounts and other deductions  received from the relevant alliance agreement partner 
sales milestones  royalties and promotion fees are recognized as revenue when earned under the agreements  and any adjustments related to estimated sales discounts and other deductions are recognized in the period the alliance agreement partner reports the amounts to us 
stock based compensation we estimate the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan rights granted using the black scholes valuation model 
this estimate is affected by our stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the expected volatility of our stock price  the expected term of the stock option  the risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
in determining our volatility factor  we perform an analysis of our historical volatility since our initial public offering in april in addition  we 
table of contents consider the expected volatility of similar entities 
in evaluating similar entities  we consider factors such as industry  stage of development  size and financial leverage 
in determining the expected life of the options  we use the simplified method 
under this method  the expected life is presumed to be the mid point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
we will continue to use the simplified method until we have sufficient historical exercise data to estimate the expected life of the options 
the fair value of options granted is amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the awards  which is generally the vesting period ranging from one to four years 
pre vesting forfeitures were estimated to be approximately for  and as the majority of options granted contain monthly vesting terms 
in  certain stock options were granted to employees at or above the vice president level that vest upon the attainment of specific financial performance targets 
the measurement date of stock options containing performance based vesting is the date the stock option grant is authorized and the specific performance goals are communicated 
compensation expense is recognized based on the probability that the performance criteria will be met 
the recognition of compensation expense associated with performance based vesting requires judgment in assessing the probability of meeting the performance goals  as well as defined criteria for assessing achievement of the performance related goals 
the continued assessment of probability may result in additional expense recognition or expense reversal depending on the level of achievement of the performance goals 
we recorded compensation expense of approximately  in related to stock options containing performance based vesting 
there was no compensation expense associated with these options in the following table includes stock based compensation recognized in our consolidated statements of operations in thousands years ended december  cost of product sales research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring charges total as of december   total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options was approximately million  and the weighted average period over which it was expected to be recognized was years 
income taxes we provide for income taxes under the liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements 
we provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit or if future deductibility is uncertain 
on january   we adopted the authoritative guidance relating to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
this guidance clarifies the recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap 
there are also areas in which our management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
please see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued authoritative guidance that amends existing revenue recognition accounting pronouncements related to multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the new guidance provides accounting principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangement should be separated  and how the consideration should be allocated 
this guidance expands the methods under which a company can establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
the new guidance is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  in december  the fasb issued authoritative guidance concerning the recognition and classification of the new annual fee payable by branded prescription drug manufacturers and importers on branded prescription drugs which was mandated under the health care reform legislation enacted in the us in march under this new authoritative guidance  the annual fee should be estimated and recognized in full as a liability upon the first qualifying commercial sale with a corresponding deferred cost that is amortized to operating expenses using a straight line method unless another method better allocates the fee over the calendar year in which it is payable 
this new guidance is effective for calendar years beginning on or after december   when the fee initially becomes effective 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and product sales  net 
product sales  net were million for  million for and million for and consisted of sales of zegerid capsules and zegerid powder for oral suspension 
in  product sales  net also consisted of sales of the authorized generic version of zegerid capsules under our distribution and supply agreement with prasco and sales of cycloset which we launched in november the million decrease in product sales  net from to was comprised of approximately million related to a decrease in sales volume comprised primarily of our zegerid products  including the authorized generic products  offset by approximately million related to increased average selling prices 
these decreases in volume resulted from par pharmaceutical  inc s  or par s  commencement of its commercial sale of its generic version of our zegerid capsules prescription products in late june the million increase in product sales  net from to was comprised of approximately million related to an increase in the sales volume of our zegerid products  primarily driven by zegerid capsules  as well as approximately million related to increased average selling prices 
promotion revenue 
promotion revenue was million for  million for and million for promotion revenue included fees earned under our promotion agreement with depomed of approximately million in  million in and million in we began promoting glumetza under the promotion agreement with depomed in october promotion revenue for was negatively impacted by depomed s voluntary recall and supply interruption of glumetza mg which resulted in the unavailability of this dosage strength from june through early january in  promotion revenue also included co promotion fees earned under our agreements with victory pharma  inc  or victory  pursuant to which we co promoted naprelan naproxen sodium controlled release tablets and with cb fleet company  incorporated  or fleet  pursuant to which we co promoted the fleet phospho soda ez prep bowel cleansing system 
in july  we and victory mutually agreed to terminate our co promotion agreement previously entered into in june we ended all promotional efforts under the agreement as of september  we entered into our co promotion agreement with fleet in august  which was subsequently amended in may effective as of october   our co promotion agreement expired in accordance with its terms 

table of contents royalty revenue 
royalty revenue was million for and was comprised primarily of royalty revenue earned under our license agreement with merck for zegerid otc 
merck commenced commercial sales of zegerid otc in march there was no royalty revenue for or other license revenue 
other license revenue was  for  million for and million for significant components of our other license revenue are described below in october  we received a nonrefundable million upfront payment in connection with our license agreement with norgine 
the million upfront payment was amortized over a three month period through early january  which represented the period during which we had significant responsibilities under the agreement 
in december  we received a million one time nonrefundable milestone payment from merck following the approval of the new drug application  or nda  submitted by merck for zegerid otc omeprazole mg sodium bicarbonate mg capsules 
in june  we received a million nonrefundable milestone payment from merck relating to fda acceptance for filing of the nda submitted by merck for zegerid otc 
we recognized the milestone payments of million and million in other license revenue in and  respectively  due to the substantive nature of the milestones achieved 
in november  we received a nonrefundable million upfront license fee in connection with our license agreement with merck 
the million upfront payment was amortized to revenue on a straight line basis over a month period through the end of  which represented the period during which we had significant responsibilities under the agreement 
in december  we received a nonrefundable million upfront payment in connection with our license agreement with gsk 
to support gsk s initial launch costs  we agreed to waive the first million of aggregate royalties payable to us 
of the total million upfront payment  the million in waived royalty obligations was recorded as deferred revenue and is being recognized as royalty revenue as the royalties are earned 
the remaining million was also recorded as deferred revenue and was amortized to revenue on a straight line basis over an month period through may  which represented the period during which we had significant obligations under the agreement 
in october  we received a nonrefundable million upfront payment in connection with our non exclusive agreement with otsuka america pharmaceutical inc  or otsuka america  under which otsuka america had been co promoting zegerid capsules and zegerid powder for oral suspension 
the million upfront payment initially was being amortized to revenue on a straight line basis over the month contractual term through the end of on may   we agreed to terminate the co promotion agreement effective as of june  and amortized the remaining balance of the million up front payment 
we recognized other license revenue associated with this amortization of million in cost of product sales 
cost of product sales was million for  million for and million for  or approximately  and of net product sales  respectively 
cost of product sales consists primarily of raw materials  third party manufacturing costs  freight and indirect personnel and other overhead costs associated with the sales of our cycloset and zegerid prescription products as well as shipments to prasco of the authorized generic version of zegerid capsules 
cost of product sales also includes reserves for excess  dated or obsolete commercial inventories based on an analysis of inventory on hand and on firm purchase commitments compared to forecasts of future sales 
the increase in our cost of product sales as a percentage of net product sales from to was primarily attributable to a reserve of approximately million recognized in against on hand inventories of our zegerid products in connection with the launch of generic and authorized generic versions of prescription zegerid capsules and our related decision to cease promotion of zegerid 
license fees and royalties 
license fees and royalties were million for  million for and million for license fees and royalties consist of royalties due to the university of missouri based upon net product sales of our zegerid prescription products  sales of zegerid otc by merck under our license agreement and products sold by gsk under our license agreement 
in addition  license fees and royalties include milestone payments and upfront fees expensed or amortized under license agreements  as well as changes in the fair value of contingent consideration related to business combinations 
the million increase in license fees and royalties 
table of contents from to was primarily due to the million upfront fee we paid to pharming in connection with the license and supply agreements we entered into in september and a million accrual related to the one time million sales milestone due to depomed based on glumetza net product sales in excess of million during the month period ending january the increase in license fees and royalties was also attributable to a milestone payment to cosmo based on the achievement of both of the primary endpoints in the european union  or eu  and us phase iii studies for budesonide mmx with statistical significance and demonstrated adequate safety 
cosmo elected to receive payment through the issuance of  shares of our common stock 
the fair value of the shares issued to cosmo was approximately million 
the million decrease in license fees and royalties from to resulted primarily from the upfront cash payment of million and the fair value of  shares of our common stock issued to cosmo of approximately million under our license agreement  stock issuance agreement and registration rights agreement entered into in december the total of approximately million was included in license fees and royalties in in  license fees and royalties also included royalties due to otsuka america under our co promotion agreement based on our net product sales 
following the termination of our co promotion agreement effective as of june   we were no longer obligated to pay royalties to otsuka america 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million for  million for and million for the million increase in our research and development expenses from to was primarily attributable to costs associated with our phase iii clinical program evaluating rifamycin sv mmx in patients with travelers diarrhea  which was initiated in the second quarter of  start up costs associated with our phase ii proof of concept study evaluating recombinant human c inhibitor in early amr in renal transplant patients and increased compensation costs associated with an increase in research and development personnel and annual merit increases 
these increases were offset in part by a decrease in our research and development expenses related to the budesonide mmx phase iii clinical program 
the million increase in our research and development expenses from to was primarily attributable to the budesonide mmx phase iii clinical program 
in addition  the increase in our research and development expenses from to was attributable to increased compensation costs associated with an increase in research and development personnel and annual merit increases  and payment of the user fee associated with the submission of our b nda to the fda for our immediate release omeprazole prescription product in a tablet formulation 
these increases in our research and development expenses from to were offset in part by a decrease in manufacturing development costs associated with the tablet formulation 
we have determined not to commercialize the tablet product at this time 
research and development expenses have historically consisted primarily of costs associated with clinical studies of our products under development as well as clinical studies designed to further differentiate our products from those of our competitors  development of and preparation for commercial manufacturing of our products  compensation and other expenses related to research and development personnel and facilities expenses 
in connection with our strategic collaboration with cosmo entered into in december  we are developing two product candidates targeting gastrointestinal  or gi  conditions 
budesonide mmx is a corticosteroid in a novel oral tablet formulation  dosed one tablet once a day  which utilizes proprietary mmx colonic delivery technology and is being developed for the treatment of ulcerative colitis 
we have announced statistically significant top line results from two phase iii clinical studies which evaluated budesonide mmx mg for the induction of remission of mild or moderate active ulcerative colitis 
we plan to submit an nda for budesonide mmx to the fda by the end of rifamycin sv mmx is a broad spectrum  semi synthetic antibiotic in a novel oral tablet formulation  which utilizes proprietary mmx colonic delivery technology and is being developed for the treatment of patients with travelers diarrhea and potentially for other diseases that have an infectious component in the intestine 
rifamycin sv mmx mg oral tablets taken twice daily times mg per dose  mg total daily dose is currently being investigated in a phase iii clinical program in patients with travelers diarrhea 
we have acquired rights to rhucin under license and supply agreements with pharming 
rhucin is a recombinant version of the human protein c inhibitor  which is produced using proprietary transgenic technology 
in december  pharming submitted a bla to the fda seeking approval to market rhucin for the treatment of acute attacks of hae  an orphan disease 
on february   based on prior discussions with the fda  
table of contents pharming announced initiation of a placebo controlled  double blind phase iiib clinical study with approximately patients to provide additional data in support of the u kg dose 
on february   pharming announced receipt of a refusal to file letter from the fda for the rhucin bla 
in the letter the fda indicated that the bla was not sufficiently complete to enable a critical medical review and indicated that the fda will provide additional feedback on the design of the ongoing phase iiib clinical study 
in addition  the fda requested that the results of the phase iiib clinical study be included in any future bla submission for rhucin 
both we and pharming intend to meet with the fda at the earliest opportunity to discuss the issues raised in the fda letter and to reach a more comprehensive understanding of what would be required for the bla to be accepted for review 
in addition  a phase ii proof of concept study is planned to evaluate recombinant human c inhibitor for the treatment of early amr in renal transplant patients 
we have acquired the exclusive worldwide rights to san through the acquisition of covella and a related license agreement with biogen 
san is an inhibitor of vla  also known as integrin  and has shown activity in multiple preclinical models of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases 
we believe that san may have potential application as a drug candidate in multiple inflammatory and autoimmune diseases  including rheumatoid arthritis  inflammatory bowel disease  psoriasis and organ transplantation 
we expect to begin a single dose  dose escalation phase i clinical study in march april we are unable to estimate with any certainty the research and development costs that we may incur in the future 
we have also committed  in connection with the approval of our ndas for zegerid powder for oral suspension  to evaluate the product in pediatric populations  including pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic  or pk pd  and safety studies 
we have not yet commenced any of the studies and have requested a waiver of this requirement from the fda 
in the future  we may conduct additional clinical studies to further differentiate our marketed products and products under development  as well as conduct research and development related to any future products that we may in license or otherwise acquire 
although we are currently focused primarily on the advancement of the budesonide mmx  rhucin  rifamycin sv mmx and san development stage products  we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which development projects to pursue and how much funding to direct to each project on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific  clinical and commercial merits of each project 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for  million for and million for the million decrease in our selling  general and administrative expenses from to was primarily attributable to a decrease in compensation  benefits and related employee costs and a decrease in zegerid promotional spending related to our decision to cease promotion of our zegerid prescription products and implement a corporate restructuring in the third quarter of the decrease in our selling  general and administrative expenses was also attributable to a decrease in legal fees associated with the patent infringement litigation against par and a decrease in glumetza promotional spending 
these decreases in selling  general and administrative expenses were offset in part by an increase in advertising and promotional spending related to the launch of cycloset 
the million decrease in our selling  general and administrative expenses from to was primarily attributable to decreases in costs associated with advertising and promotional activities related to our zegerid products and a decrease in the number of sales representatives under our contract sales organization agreement 
these decreases in our selling  general and administrative expenses were offset in part by an increase in legal fees primarily due to the patent infringement litigation against par  costs associated with the advertising and promotion of the glumetza products and increased compensation costs resulting from annual merit increases 
restructuring charges 
as a result of our restructuring plan  we recorded a restructuring charge of million in  consisting of million in one time termination benefits including pay during the worker adjustment and retraining notification act  or warn  notice period in lieu of work  severance and healthcare benefits  million in contract termination costs and  of non cash stock based compensation 
our decision to cease promotion of our zegerid prescription products and implement a corporate restructuring resulted from par s decision to launch a generic version of our zegerid prescription products in late june the corporate restructuring included a workforce reduction of approximately  or employees  in our commercial organization and certain other operations

in addition  our cash requirements will depend on market acceptance of any other products that we may market in the future  the success of our strategic alliances  the resources we devote to researching  developing  formulating  manufacturing  commercializing and supporting our products  and our ability to enter into third party collaborations 
in connection with our corporate restructuring announced in late june  we recorded significant restructuring charges relating to employment termination benefits and contract termination costs in the third quarter of however  we may not be able to sustain the cost savings and other anticipated benefits from our restructuring  and we cannot guarantee that any of our restructuring efforts will be successful  or that we will not have to undertake additional restructuring activities 
while we have retained approximately sales representatives to promote both glumetza and cycloset  this reduced commercial presence may not be adequate to grow sales of these type diabetes products 
in addition  with reduced resources  other components of our strategic plans may be negatively impacted  such as reduced capacity to evaluate  negotiate and fund the acquisition or license of additional specialty pharmaceutical products 
our 
table of contents workforce and expense reduction efforts may have an adverse impact on our ability to retain key personnel due to the perceived risk of future workforce and expense reductions 
these employees  whether or not directly affected by the reduction  may seek future employment with our business partners or competitors 
even if we are able to realize the expected cost savings from our restructuring activities  our operating results and financial condition may continue to be adversely affected by declining product revenues 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and use of our line of credit will be sufficient to fund our current operations through at least the next twelve months  however  our projected revenue may decrease or our expenses may increase and that would lead to our cash resources being consumed earlier than we expect 
although we do not believe that we will need to raise additional funds to finance our current operations through at least the next twelve months  we may pursue raising additional funds in connection with licensing or acquisition of new products or the continued development of our product candidates 
sources of additional funds may include funds generated through equity and or debt financings or through strategic collaborations or licensing agreements 
in november  we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission  which was declared effective in december the universal shelf registration statement replaced our previous universal shelf registration statement that expired in december the universal shelf registration statement may permit us  from time to time  to offer and sell up to an additional approximately million of equity or debt securities 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such offerings of securities 
factors influencing the availability of additional financing include the progress of our commercial and development activities  investor perception of our prospects and the general condition of the financial markets  among others 
in july  we entered into our loan agreement with comerica  which was subsequently amended in july  pursuant to which we may request advances in an aggregate outstanding amount not to exceed million 
in december  we drew down million under the loan agreement 
the revolving loan bears interest at a variable rate of interest  per annum  most recently announced by comerica as its prime rate plus  which as of december  was 
interest payments on advances made under the loan agreement are due and payable in arrears on the first calendar day of each month during the term of the loan agreement 
on august   we entered into an amendment with comerica that extends the maturity date of the revolving line from july  to july  amounts borrowed under the loan agreement may be repaid and re borrowed at any time prior to july   and any outstanding principal drawn during the term of the loan facility is due and payable on july  there is a non refundable unused commitment fee equal to per annum on the difference between the amount of the revolving line and the average daily balance outstanding thereunder during the term of the loan agreement  payable quarterly in arrears 
the loan agreement will remain in full force and effect for so long as any obligations remain outstanding or comerica has any obligation to make credit extensions under the loan agreement 
amounts borrowed under the loan agreement are secured by substantially all of our personal property  excluding intellectual property 
under the loan agreement  we are subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants  including limitations on our ability to undergo certain change of control events  convey  sell  lease  license  transfer or otherwise dispose of assets  create  incur  assume  guarantee or be liable with respect to certain indebtedness  grant liens  pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments  and make investments 
in addition  under the loan agreement  we are required to maintain a cash balance with comerica in an amount of not less than million and to maintain any other cash balances with either comerica or another financial institution covered by a control agreement for the benefit of comerica 
we are also subject to specified financial covenants with respect to a minimum liquidity ratio and  in specified limited circumstances  minimum ebitda requirements 
we believe we have currently met all of our obligations under the loan agreement 
we cannot be certain that our existing cash and marketable securities resources and use of our line of credit will be adequate to sustain our current operations 
to the extent we require additional funding  we cannot be certain that such funding will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity or convertible securities  our stockholders ownership will be diluted 
any debt financing we enter into may involve covenants that restrict our operations 
if adequate funds are not available on terms acceptable to us 
table of contents at that time  our ability to continue our current operations or pursue new product opportunities would be significantly limited 
in addition  our results of operations could be materially affected by economic conditions generally  both in the us and elsewhere around the world 
continuing concerns over inflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market and a declining residential real estate market in the us have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets going forward 
these factors  combined with volatile oil prices  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment  have precipitated an economic recession 
domestic and international equity markets continue to experience heightened volatility and turmoil 
these events and the continuing market upheavals may have an adverse effect on us 
in the event of a continuing market downturn  our results of operations could be adversely affected by those factors in many negative ways  including making it more difficult for us to raise funds if necessary  and our stock price may further decline 
in addition  we maintain significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents at one or more financial institutions that are in excess of federally insured limits 
given the current instability of financial institutions  we cannot be assured that we will not experience losses on these deposits 
in march  the president signed the patient protection and affordable care act  which makes extensive changes to the delivery of healthcare in the us this act includes numerous provisions that affect pharmaceutical companies  some of which are effective immediately and others of which will be taking effect over the next several years 
for example  the act seeks to expand healthcare coverage to the uninsured through private health insurance reforms and an expansion of medicaid 
the act will also impose substantial costs on pharmaceutical manufacturers  such as an increase in liability for rebates paid to medicaid  new drug discounts that must be offered to certain enrollees in the medicare prescription drug benefit  an annual fee imposed on all manufacturers of brand prescription drugs in the us  and an expansion of an existing program requiring pharmaceutical discounts to certain types of hospitals and federally subsidized clinics 
the act also contains cost containment measures that could reduce reimbursement levels for healthcare items and services generally  including pharmaceuticals 
it also will require reporting and public disclosure of payments and other transfers of value provided by pharmaceutical companies to physicians and teaching hospitals 
these measures could result in decreased net revenues from our pharmaceutical products and decreased potential returns from our development efforts 
as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk under the terms of our loan agreement with comerica bank  or comerica  the interest rate applicable to any amounts borrowed by us under the credit facility will be  at our election  indexed to either comerica s prime rate or the libor rate 
if we elect comerica s prime rate for all or any portion of our borrowings  the interest rate will be variable  which would expose us to the risk of increased interest expense if interest rates rise 
if we elect the libor rate for all or any portion of our borrowings  such libor rate will remain fixed only for a specified  limited period of time after the date of our election  after which we will be required to repay the borrowed amount  or elect a new interest rate indexed to either comerica s prime rate or the libor rate 
the new rate may be higher than the earlier interest rate applicable under the loan agreement 
as of december   the balance outstanding under the credit facility was million  and we had elected the prime rate plus interest rate option  which was as of december  under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in the interest rate under the loan agreement would not materially affect our interest expense at our current level of borrowing 
in addition to market risk related to our loan agreement with comerica  we are exposed to market risk primarily in the area of changes in us interest rates and conditions in the credit markets  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term marketable securities 
we do not have any material foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments 
our short term investment securities have consisted of corporate debt securities  
table of contents government agency securities and us treasury securities which are classified as available for sale and therefore reported on the consolidated balance sheet at estimated market value 
our results of operations could be materially affected by economic conditions generally  both in the us and elsewhere around the world 
continuing concerns over inflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the us mortgage market and a declining residential real estate market in the us have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets going forward 
these factors  combined with volatile oil prices  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment  have precipitated an economic recession
