overview zion oil is an initial stage oil and gas exploration company with a history of over years of oil and gas exploration in israel 
we currently have no revenues or operating income and we are classified as an exploration stage company 
we are headquartered in dallas  texas  have an engineering satellite office in pennsylvania and a field office in caesaria  israel 
the company currently holds two petroleum exploration licenses  named the joseph license and the asher menashe license  covering approximately  acres of land onshore northern israel 
to date  we have completed drilling two exploratory wells and are currently drilling our third exploratory well in the joseph license area and have partly completed drilling one exploratory well in the asher menashe license area 
in february  we submitted to the petroleum commissioner applications for two additional exploration licenses and an application for a preliminary exploration permit 
one of the license applications and the application for the preliminary exploration permit cover substantially all of the area covered by our previous issachar zebulun permit  which expired on february  we named one license application with respect to part of the previous issachar zebulun permit the jordan valley license application and the preliminary exploration permit applied for with respect to substantially the balance of such area the zebulun permit 
we named the other license application the dead sea license application as it relates to areas within the vicinity of the dead sea 
we anticipate that the jordan valley license application will be considered by the petroleum commissioner in march and both the zebulun permit application and dead sea license application in mid summer to fall of no assurance can be provided that our license and permit applications will ultimately be granted 
our work program calls for the drilling of the ma anit joseph well to a depth of approximately  feet  meters on the joseph license 
we anticipate reaching the permian age target depth in late april  assuming that we do not encounter any further technical difficulties 
we will then test select intervals if any that have hydrocarbon bearing potential 
depending on the results  we may then need to drill an offset appraisal well to the ma anit joseph well 
as of march   the drilling of the ma anit joseph well had reached a depth of approximately  feet  meters 
financing activities to date  we have funded our operations through the issuance of our securities 
our recent financings are discussed below 
between october  and january   we raised from a follow on public offering gross proceeds of  from the sale of units of our securities  of which  was for debt conversion 
each unit offered in the follow on offering consisted of i one share of common stock  par value 
per share and ii one warrant to purchase one share of common stock at a per share exercise price equal to 
in june  we raised gross proceeds of million from a rights offering to common stockholders of up to million shares of our common stock 
the rights offering was fully subscribed  resulting in our distribution of all of the million shares that were offered 
in november  we raised an additional million from a rights offering to common stockholders of up to million shares of our common stock 
the rights offering was fully subscribed  resulting in our distribution of all of the million shares that were offered 
in july  utilizing a shelf registration statement  we raised approximately million from rights offering to common stockholders of up to million shares of our common stock 
the rights offering resulted in our distribution of  shares 
in december  utilizing the shelf registration statement  we raised an approximately million from a fourth rights offering to common stockholders of up to  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock 
the rights offering was subscribed for a total of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock 
between january  and march  we raised approximately  from the exercise of our publicly traded warrants trading under the symbol znwaw that we previously issued to investors in connection with our follow on public offering which we completed in january we reduced the exercise price of these warrants  for a limited time period extending from january  through march   to from an original per share exercise price of 
in addition  between january  to march   we raised an additional  from the exercise of the warrants that we issued in december in connection with our last completed rights offering that trade under the symbol znwaz 
principal components of our cost structure our operating and other expenses primarily consist of the following impairment of unproved oil and gas properties impairment expense is recognized if a determination is made that a well will not be able to be commercially productive 
the amounts include amounts paid in respect of the drilling operations as well as geological and geophysical costs and various amounts that were paid to israeli regulatory authorities 
general and administrative expenses overhead  including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff  costs of managing our exploratory operations  audit and other professional fees  and legal compliance are included in general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense also includes non cash stock based compensation expense  investors relations related expenses  lease and insurance and related expenses 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion 
the systematic expensing of the capital costs incurred to explore for natural gas and oil 
as a full cost company  we capitalize all costs associated with our exploration  and apportion these costs to each unit of production  if any  through depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
as we have yet to have production  the costs of abandoned wells are written off immediately versus being included in this amortization pool 
going concern basis our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business 
since we are in the development stage  we have limited capital resources  no revenue to date and a loss from operations 
the appropriateness of using the going concern basis is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional financing or equity capital and  ultimately  to achieve profitable operations 
the uncertainty of these conditions in the past has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
critical accounting policies management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expense during the reporting period 
we have identified the accounting principles which we believe are most critical to the reported financial status by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex of subjective decisions or assessment 
we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
accordingly  all costs associated with acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas reserves  including directly related overhead costs  are capitalized 
all capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  including the estimated future costs to develop proved reserves  are amortized on the unit of production method using estimates of proved reserves 
investments in unproved properties and major development projects are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs 
if the results of an assessment indicate that the properties are impaired  the amount of the impairment is included in income from continuing operations before income taxes and the adjusted carrying amount of the unproved properties is amortized on the unit of production method 
the company s oil and gas property represents an investment in unproved properties and two major development projects on that property 
these costs are excluded from the amortized cost pool until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired 
all costs excluded are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred 
the amount of any impairment is charged to expense since a reserve base has not yet been established 
a further impairment requiring a charge to expense may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results  relinquishing drilling rights or other information  but has not occurred since july abandonment of properties is accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs 
the net capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test which limits such costs to the aggregate of the estimated present value of future net revenues from proved reserves discounted at ten percent based on current economic and operating conditions  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties 
the recoverability of amounts capitalized for oil and gas properties is dependent upon the identification of economically recoverable reserves  together with obtaining the necessary financing to exploit such reserves and the achievement of profitable operations 
in june  following the analysis of the results of the testing of our ma anit well workover and an evaluation of the mechanical condition of the well  we determined that the well was incapable of producing oil and or gas in commercial quantities 
in order to optimize drilling operations on the company s planned ma anit rehoboth well  we ceased operations on the ma anit well and  as required by the petroleum law  formally relinquished the ma anit joseph license 
as planned  we used the ma anit wellbore  down to approximately  feet  meters  as the upper part of the wellbore for the ma anit rehoboth well 
as a result of the abandonment of the ma anit well and formal relinquishment of the ma anit joseph license  the company recorded in june an impairment of  to its unproved oil and gas properties 
we ultimately drilled the ma anit rehoboth well to a depth of  feet  meters 
our testing procedures conclusively determined in april that the well was at the time incapable of producing oil and or gas in commercial quantities  so we temporarily suspended operations on the well and recorded a non cash impairment charge of  to our unproved oil and gas properties for the quarter ending june  although both our properties and our principal operations are in israel  we report all our transactions in united states dollars 
certain of the dollar amounts in the financial statements may represent the dollar equivalent of other currencies 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to the amount that we believe  is likely to be realized in the future 
in assessing the need for the valuation allowance we have considered not only future taxable income but also feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
in the event that we were to determine that it would be likely that we would  in the future  realize our deferred tax assets in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be made 
in the period that such a determination was made  the adjustment to the deferred tax asset would produce an increase in our net income 
we do not participate in  nor have we created  any off balance sheet special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing 
in addition  we do not enter into any derivative financial instruments 
we record a liability for asset retirement obligation at fair value in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived assets 
results of operations the following table sets forth our statements of operations data for the years ended december st 
all data is in thousands general and administrative expenses legal and professional salaries other impairment of unproved oil and gas properties interest income net loss for the year ended december  compared to december  revenue 
we currently have no revenue generating operations as we are still a development stage company 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses in compared to is primarily attributable to the impairment charge of  recorded during the three months ended june  in respect of the ma anit rehoboth well

we believe that our currently available cash resources will be sufficient to enable us to meet our operating requirements in carrying out our plans through december  including completing the ma anit joseph well and any production testing and other analyses that may be required 
as of march  we had outstanding publicly traded warrants exercisable through december  and trading under the symbol znwaz at a per share exercise price of  for potential aggregate cash proceeds payable to us of approximately  additionally  as of march  had outstanding publicly traded warrants exercisable through january  and trading under the symbol znwaw at a per share exercise price of  for potential aggregate cash proceeds payable to us of approximately  unless we receive significant proceeds during from the exercise of these publicly traded warrants of which no assurance can be provided  we anticipate needing to raise additional funds to maintain operations beyond that date and in order to realize our multi well drilling plan and acquire a majority working interest in an onshore deep drilling rig in israel 
we anticipate that we can raise funds by attracting additional investment in our company or additional parties to join our drilling operations 
finally  we can raise up to approximately million from additional sales of our securities under an existing shelf registration statement 
we have no commitments for any such financing or participation and no assurance can be provided that we will be successful in attracting any such investment 
contractual obligations in addition to our capital expenditure program  we are committed to making cash payments in the future on three types of contracts drilling commitments  employment agreements and operating leases 
as of december   we do not have any off balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
the table below provides estimates of the timing of future payments that we are obligated to make based on agreements in place at december  the following summarizes our contractual financial obligations for continuing operations at december  and their future maturities 
payment due by period in thousands thereafter total drilling commitments operating leases employment agreements off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently use any off balance sheet arrangements to enhance our liquidity or capital resource position  or for any other purpose

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is a broad term for the risk of economic loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of a financial instrument 
these changes may be the result of various factors  including interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices and or equity prices 
in the normal course of doing business  we are exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risks 
a portion of our expenses  primarily labor expenses and certain supplier contracts  are nominated in new israeli shekels nis 
as a result  we have significant exposure to the risk of fluctuating exchange rates with the us dollar  our primary reporting currency 
the recent weakness of the us dollar in the international markets has been equally reflected against nis and this may continue in the future 
since december   and  to the current date  the us dollar has devalued by approximately nil  and respectively against the nis 
continuing devaluation of the us dollar against the nis will result in higher operating costs from nis denominated expenses 
we do not currently hedge against currency exchange rate risks 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk relates to our cash and investments 
we maintain an investment portfolio of short term bank deposits and money market funds 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  and are  due to their very short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
because of the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that a change in market interest rates would have a significant negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio except for reduced income in a low interest rate environment 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term bank deposits of approximately  the weighted average annual interest rate related to our cash and cash equivalents for the year ended december  was approximately 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest our excess cash in short term bank deposits and money market funds that may invest in high quality debt instruments
