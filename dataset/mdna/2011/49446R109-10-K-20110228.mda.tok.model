critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements of the company include the accounts of the company  its wholly owned subsidiaries and all entities in which the company has a controlling interest  including where the company has been determined to be a primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity in accordance with the consolidation guidance of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc 
the company applies these provisions to each of its joint venture investments to determine whether the cost  equity or consolidation method of accounting is appropriate 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financ ial statements  management has made its best estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
these estimates are based on  but not limited to  historical results  industry standards and current economic conditions  giving due consideration to materiality 
the most significant assumptions and estimates relate to revenue recognition and the recoverability of trade accounts receivable  depreciable lives  valuation of real estate and intangible assets and liabilities  valuation of joint venture investments  marketable securities and other investments  realizability of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions 
application of these assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties  and  as a result  actual results could materially differ from these estimates 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties  investments in joint ventures  marketable securities and other investments 
the company s reported net earnings is directly affected by management s estimate of impairments and or valuation allowances 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable base rental revenues from rental property are recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the related leases 
certain of these leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the lessee 
these percentage rents are recorded once the required sales level is achieved 
operating expense reimbursements are recognized as earned 
rental income may also include payments received in connection with lease termination agreements 
in addition  leases typically provide for reimbursement to the company of common area maintenance  real estate taxes and other operating expenses 
the company makes estimates of the uncollectability of its accounts receivable related to base rents  straight line rent  expense reimbursements and other revenues 
the company analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt levels  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition  tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed and estimates are made in connection with the expected recovery of pre petition and post petition claims 
the company s reported net earnings is directly affected by management s estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable 
real estate the company s investments in real estate properties are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
significant renovations and replacements  which improve and extend the life of the asset  are capitalized 
upon acquisition of real estate operating properties  the company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land  building  building improvements and tenant improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and below market leases  in place leases and tenant relationships  assumed debt and redeemable units issued at the date of acquisition  based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date 
based on these estimates  the company allocates the estimated fair value to the applicable assets and liabilities 
fair value is determined based on an exit price approach  which contemplates the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
if  up to one year from the acquisition date  information regarding fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is rece ived and estimates are refined  appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation on a retrospective basis 
the company expenses transaction costs associated with business combinations in the period incurred 
depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  as follows buildings and building improvements to years fixtures  leasehold and tenant improvements terms of leases or useful including certain identified intangible assets lives  whichever is shorter the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net earnings 
real estate under development on the company s consolidated balance sheets represents ground up development of neighborhood and community shopping center projects which may be subsequently sold upon completion or which the company may hold as long term investments 
these assets are carried at cost 
the cost of land and buildings under development includes specifically identifiable costs 
the capitalized costs include pre construction costs essential to the development of the property  development costs  construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes  salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved and other costs incurred during the period of development 
the company ceases cost capitalization when the property is held available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements  but no later than one year from the completion of major construction activity 
a gain on the sale of these assets is g enerally recognized using the full accrual method in accordance with the provisions of the fasb s real estate sales guidance provided that various criteria relating to terms of the sale and subsequent involvement by the company with the property are met 
on a continuous basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators  including property operating performance and general market conditions  that the value of the real estate properties including any related amortizable intangible assets or liabilities may be impaired 
a property value is considered impaired only if management s estimate of current and projected operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the property over its remaining useful life is less than the net carrying value of the property 
such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to an amount to reflect the estimated fair value of the property 
when a real estate asset is identified by management as held for sale  the company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price of such asset net of selling costs 
if  in management s opinion  the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of such asset  an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property 
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures the company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as the company exercises significant influence  but does not control  these entities 
these investments are recorded initially at cost and are subsequently adjusted for cash contributions and distributions 
earnings for each investment are recognized in accordance with each respective investment agreement and  where applicable  are based upon an allocation of the investment s net assets at book value as if the investment was hypothetically liquidated at the end of each reporting period 
the company s joint ventures and other real estate investments primarily consist of co investments with institutional and other joint venture partners in neighborhood and community shopping center properties  consistent with its core business 
these joint ventures typically obtain non recourse third party financing on their property investments  thus contractually limiting the company s exposure to losses to the amount of its equity investment  and  due to the lender s exposure to losses  a lender typically will require a minimum level of equity in order to mitigate its risk 
the company s exposure to losses associated with its unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily limited to its carrying value in these investments 
the company  on a limited selective basis  obtained unsecured financing for certain joint ventures 
these unsecured financings are guaranteed by the company with guarantees from the joint ventur e partners for their proportionate amounts of any guaranty payment the company is obligated to make 
on a continuous basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators  including property operating performance and general market conditions  that the value of the company s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired 
an investment s value is impaired only if management s estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment and such difference is deemed to be other than temporary 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment 
the company s estimated fair values are based upon a discounted cash flow model for each specific property that includes all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period and where applicable  any estimated debt premiums 
capitalization rates  discount rates and credit spreads utilized in these models are based upon rates that the company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for each respective property 
marketable securities the company classifies its existing marketable equity securities as available for sale in accordance with the fasb s investments debt and equity securities guidance 
these securities are carried at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income oci 
gains or losses on securities sold are based on the specific identification method 
all debt securities are generally classified as held to maturity because the company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity 
held to maturity securities are stated at amortized cost  adjusted for any amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
debt securities which contain conversion features are generally classified as available for sale 
these securities are carried at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as a component of oci 
on a continuous basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the company s marketable securities may be impaired 
a marketable security is impaired if the fair value of the security is less than the carrying value of the security and such difference is deemed to be other than temporary 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss shall be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the security over the estimated fair value in the security 
realizability of deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions the company is subject to federal  state and local income taxes on the income from its activities relating to its trs activities and subject to local taxes on certain non us investments 
the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized based on future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted 
a reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required  if based on the evidence available  it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than percent that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company considers all available evidence  both positive and negative  to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  a valuation allowance is needed 
information about an enterprise current financial position and its results of operations for the current and preceding years is supplemented by all currently available information about future years 
future realization of the tax benefit of an existing deductible temporary difference or carryforward ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character for example  ordinary income or capital gain within the carryback or carryforward period available under the tax law 
the company must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
the more negative evidence that exists a the more positive evidence is necessary and b the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion or all of the deferred tax asset 
the company believes  when evaluating deferred tax assets within its taxable reit subsidiaries  special consideration should be given to the unique relationship between the company as a reit and its taxable reit subsidiaries 
this relationship exists primarily to protect the reit s qualification under the code by permitting  within certain limits  the reit to engage in certain business activities in which the reit cannot directly participate 
as such  the reit controls which and when investments are held in  or distributed or sold from  its taxable reit subsidiaries 
this relationship distinguishes a reit and taxable reit subsidiary from an enterprise that operates as a single  consolidated corporate taxpayer 
the company primarily utilizes a twenty year projection of pre tax book income and taxable income as positive evidence to overcome its significant negative evidence of a three year cumulative pretax book loss 
although items of income and expense utilized in the projection are objectively verifiable there is also significant judgment used in determining the duration and timing of events that would impact the projection 
based upon the company s analysis of negative and positive evidence the company will make a determination of the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets 
if future income projections do not occur as forecasted  the company will reevaluate the need for a valuation allowance 
in addition  the company can employ additional strategies to realize its deferred tax assets including transferring a greater portion of its property management business to the trs  sale of certain built in gain assets  and further reducing intercompany debt see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the company recognizes and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions which requires significant judgment from management 
although the company believes it has adequately reserved for any uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in the company s income tax expense in the period in which a change is made  which could have a material impact on operating results see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k

the company accounts for its preferred equity investments under the equity method of accounting 
as of december   the company s net investment under the preferred equity program was approximately million relating to properties

additionally  during july  the company invested approximately million of preferred equity capital in a portfolio comprised of net leased properties which are divided into master leased pools with each pool leased to individual corporate operators 
these properties consist of a diverse array of free standing restaurants  fast food restaurants  convenience and auto parts stores 
as of december   these properties were encumbered by third party loans aggregating approximately million with interest rates ranging from to with a weighted average interest rate of and maturities ranging from one year to years 
during june  the company acquired a equity participation interest in an existing leveraged lease of properties 
the properties are leased under a long term bond type net lease whose primary term expires in  with the lessee having certain renewal option rights 
the company s cash equity investment was approximately million 
this equity investment is reported as a net investment in leveraged lease in accordance with the fasb s lease guidance 
the net investment in leveraged lease reflects the original cash investment adjusted by remaining net rentals  estimated unguaranteed residual value  unearned and deferred income and deferred taxes relating to the investment 
as of december   of these leveraged lease properties were sold  whereby the proceeds from the sales were used to pay down the mortgage debt by approximately million 
as of december   the remaining properties were encumbered by third party non recourse debt of approximately million that is scheduled to fully amortize during the primary term of the lease from a portion of the periodic net rents receivable under the net lease 
as an equity participant in the leveraged lease  the company has no recourse obligation for principal or interest payments on the debt  which is collateralized by a first mortgage lien on the properties and collateral assignment of the lease 
accordingly  this debt has been offset against the related net rental receivable under the lease 
effects of inflation many of the company leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants gross sales above pre determined thresholds  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
in addition  many of the company leases are for terms of less than years  which permits the company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal 
most of the company leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance costs  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
the company periodically evaluates its exposure to short term interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and will  from time to time  enter into interest rate protection agreements and or foreign currency hedge agreements which mitigate  but do not eliminate  the effect of changes in interest rates on its floating rate debt and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
market and economic conditions  real estate and retail shopping sector in the us  economic and market conditions have stabilized 
credit conditions have continued to improve from the prior year with increased access and availability to secured mortgage debt and the unsecured bond and equity markets 
however  there remains concern over high unemployment rates and an uncertain economic recovery in europe 
these conditions have contributed to slow growth in the us and international economies 
historically  real estate has been subject to a wide range of cyclical economic conditions that affect various real estate markets and geographic regions with differing intensities and at different times 
different regions of the united states have and may continue to experience varying degrees of economic growth or distress 
adverse changes in general or local economic conditions could result in the inability of some tenants of the company to meet their lease obligations and could otherwise adversely affect the company s ability to attract or retain tenants 
the company s shopping centers are typically anchored by two or more national tenants who generally offer day to day necessities  rather than high priced luxury items 
in addition  the company seeks to reduce its operating and leasing risks through ownership of a portfolio of properties with a diverse geographic and tenant base 
the company monitors potential credit issues of its tenants  and analyzes the possible effects to the financial statements of the company and its unconsolidated joint ventures 
in addition to the collectability assessment of outstanding accounts receivable  the company evaluates the related real estate for recoverability as well as any tenant related deferred charges for recoverability  which may include straight line rents  deferred lease costs  tenant improvements  tenant inducements and intangible assets 
the retail shopping sector has been negatively affected by recent economic conditions  particularly in the western united states primarily california 
these conditions may result in the company s tenants delaying lease commencements or declining to extend or renew leases upon expiration 
these conditions also have forced some weaker retailers  in some cases  to declare bankruptcy and or close stores 
certain retailers have announced store closings even though they have not filed for bankruptcy protection 
however  any of these particular store closings affecting the company often represent a small percentage of the company s overall gross leasable area and the company does not currently expect store closings to have a material adverse effect on the company s overall performance
