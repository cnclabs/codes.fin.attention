overview and outlook we benefit from a diversified and balanced business  serving both commercial and government markets 
this diversification and balance was an important attribute that helped support the performance of our company during while our government systems business saw a modest revenue decline this year  our commercial systems business achieved a percent increase in sales and a basis point increase in segment operating margins 
the reduction in government systems sales during was primarily due to the adverse impact of a change in government spending priorities and the lingering effects from the delay in ratification of the us department of defense appropriations bill 
in response to the challenging market conditions and projected decrease in sales for our government systems business  we redeployed resources and implemented a restructuring plan which  along with other cost savings initiatives  will better align our resources with this new economic environment 
our commercial systems business realized revenue growth from increased sales of our avionics systems to original equipment manufacturers oems for new commercial and business aircraft 
this business also benefited from increased aftermarket sales to customers who remain focused on increasing the efficiency of their aircraft 
a continued focus on operating efficiency  strong incremental margin performance from our commercial systems business  higher share repurchases and lower tax expense drove a percent increase in diluted earnings per share  which includes an after tax gain of million resulting from the divestiture of a non core product line and an after tax charge of million related to certain restructuring and asset impairment charges 
we generated the following results for sales of billion diluted earnings per share of operating cash flow of million invested in research and development r d at percent of sales we believe our company has proven its ability to both react quickly to changing business conditions and to execute its business plans 
our fundamental strategies continue to serve us well the balance between our commercial and government businesses  the diversification of our customer base and product offerings  the integration of our business through our shared service operating model  our focus on innovation through r d 
balance we feel our business is characterized by its balance  in terms of market segment  geographic regions and product and customer sales mix 
we strive to maintain a balance between our government and commercial systems businesses  believing that the segments are complementary to one another 
diversification our business derives its revenue streams from a large number of customers  products  solutions  geographic regions and markets 
our government systems business executes against numerous programs every year for a variety of customers  including the us department of defense  state and local governments  other government agencies  civil agencies  defense contractors and foreign ministries of defense 
our commercial systems business serves customers ranging from the world largest aircraft manufacturers to individual aircraft owners within the general aviation marketplace 
this diversification of revenue sources enables us to pursue numerous growth opportunities as business conditions vary across our portfolios 
integration we have a highly integrated business reliant upon a shared services operating platform 
the integrated nature of our business allows us to leverage product and service capabilities across our segments in a manner we believe is unique in our industry 
this integration is evidenced by our product and technology centers of excellence in areas such as displays  communication  navigation and surveillance  through which we apply our core competencies to solutions in both government and commercial systems 
innovation a well funded and comprehensive r d program is a foundational aspect of our company 
our focus on developing unique solutions to our customers needs is evidenced by the large investment we dedicate towards r d programs 
it is this spending profile that has allowed us to successfully pursue and capture customer programs and that will continue to be the growth engine for our company 
looking forward to  we believe the strong revenue growth expected in our commercial systems business should more than offset the modest decline anticipated in our government systems business 
despite the revenue decline that is expected to continue in government systems  we believe diluted earnings per share will increase at more than three times the rate of overall revenue growth 
we expect to achieve this growth from incremental margins on higher anticipated commercial systems sales  continued improvements in operating efficiency and enhanced share repurchases funded through cash flow from operations and the incurrence of approximately million of debt in highlights of our earnings guidance are as follows total sales in the range of billion to billion  or about a percent to percent increase over diluted earnings per share in the range of to cash provided by operating activities in the range of million to million capital expenditures of about million total company and customer funded r d expenditures of about million  or about percent of total sales see the following sections for further discussion of and anticipated results of operations

consolidated financial results sales dollars in millions us    non us    total    percent increase sales are attributed to geographic region based on country of destination 
sales for compared to total sales increased million  or percent  in compared to  primarily due to a million increase in commercial systems sales partially offset by a million reduction in government systems sales 
incremental sales from acquisitions  principally the december acquisition of ar group  inc air routing  contributed million  or less than percentage point of revenue growth 
a more detailed discussion of sales by segment in and is found in the government systems and commercial systems financial results sections below 
domestic sales increased million  or percent  in compared to  primarily attributable to higher commercial systems sales to boeing and increased sales of our aftermarket products and services to commercial airlines and other domestic customers  including incremental service sales from the air routing acquisition  partially offset by lower sales to the us government resulting from the adverse market conditions described in the government systems sales section below 
non us sales increased by million  or percent  in compared to  primarily due to the combined impact of higher commercial systems sales to non us business oems such as bombardier and increased aftermarket revenues to commercial customers outside the us sales for compared to total sales increased million  or percent  in compared to  primarily due to a million increase in government systems sales partially offset by a million reduction in commercial systems sales 
incremental sales from the may acquisition of datapath  the december acquisition of air routing and the november acquisition of seos group limited seos  contributed a total of million in revenue  or percentage points of revenue growth 
a more detailed discussion of sales by segment in and is found in the government systems and commercial systems financial results sections below 
domestic sales increased million  or percent  in compared to  primarily attributable to sales growth in our government systems segment driven by higher product and service sales from the datapath acquisition and increased sales to the us government 
in addition  higher commercial systems sales to boeing and incremental service sales from the air routing acquisition were partially offset by decreased sales to domestic business jet oems 
non us sales decreased by million  or percent  in compared to  primarily due to lower commercial systems sales impacted by reduced production rates at non us business and regional jet oems  partially offset by incremental sales to regions outside the us from the datapath and seos acquisitions 
cost of sales dollars in millions total cost of sales   percent of total sales cost of sales consists of all costs incurred to design and manufacture our products and includes r d  raw material  labor  facility  product warranty  depreciation  amortization and other related expenses 
cost of sales for compared to total cost of sales increased million  or percent  in compared to  primarily due to the following million increase resulted from the million of net sales growth discussed in the commercial systems and government systems financial results sections below million increase was attributable to higher employee incentive compensation expenses 
for  million of employee incentive compensation expense was included in cost of sales 
for  million of employee incentive compensation expense was included in cost of sales million increase resulted from the restructuring and asset impairment charges recorded in which were classified within cost of sales  as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements the above items were partially offset by a million reduction to cost of sales attributable to lower defined benefit pension expense 
as discussed in the retirement plans section below  the reduction in pension expense was primarily due to a change in the period of time over which actuarial gains and losses are amortized 
for  pension income reduced cost of sales by million  compared to million of pension expense included within cost of sales for cost of sales for compared to total cost of sales increased million  or percent  in compared to  primarily due to the following incremental product and service cost of sales from the datapath  air routing and seos acquisitions totaling million million increase attributable to higher employee incentive compensation expenses 
for  million of employee compensation expense was included in cost of sales 
for  no employee incentive compensation was awarded 
in addition  a favorable adjustment to reduce cost of sales by million occurred during resulting from lower than expected compensation payments made to employees in for incentive awards earned in million increase attributable to higher defined benefit pension expense 
as discussed in the retirement plans section below  the increase in pension expense was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of a decrease in the discount rate used to measure our us pension expense from percent in to percent in for  million of pension expense was included within cost of sales  compared to million of pension income during million benefit due to the absence of restructuring and asset impairment charges recorded in primarily related to the closure of our facility in san jose  california the remaining variance was primarily related to a million increase in cost of sales associated with the organic sales growth in government systems  partially offset by a million net reduction in other cost of sales that was largely driven by the lower organic commercial systems sales volume 
see the government systems and commercial systems financial results sections below for further discussion r d expense is included as a component of cost of sales and is summarized as follows dollars in millions customer funded government systems commercial systems total customer funded company funded government systems commercial systems total company funded total research and development expense percent of total sales customer funded r d expenditures are incurred pursuant to contractual arrangements and are typically accounted for as contract costs within cost of sales with the reimbursement accounted for as a sale in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  customer funded r d expense also includes amortization of pre production engineering costs 
this amortization totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
company funded r d expense consists primarily of payroll related expenses of employees engaged in r d activities  engineering related product materials and equipment and subcontracting costs 
total r d expense increased million from to the customer funded portion of r d expense increased million from to  primarily due to a million increase within government systems that was largely attributable to effort on new development programs such as the kc a tanker  e special mission aircraft and the common range integrated instrumentation system criis programs 
an additional million increase resulted from commercial systems  driven by increased effort on various business and regional jet platforms 
the million increase in company funded r d was primarily within commercial systems and was largely driven by increased effort towards development of next generation avionics for business aircraft and incremental effort related to our content on the boeing aircraft 
total r d expense increased million from to the customer funded portion of r d expense increased million from to  primarily due to a million increase within government systems from customer funded development efforts on a european fixed wing aircraft program and a public safety vehicle electronics integration program 
the increase in customer funded r d was partially offset by a million decrease in company funded r d 
commercial systems company funded r d decreased million  primarily from lower spending as certain projects neared completion and the timing of other efforts were delayed as we continued to manage our cost structure and adjust to market demands 
this decrease was partially offset by an million increase in company funded r d expense within government systems  primarily related to the datapath acquisition and increased spending on other programs 
looking forward to  total r d expense is expected to be approximately million  or about percent of anticipated total company sales 
we expect customer funded r d within government systems to decrease as a result of recent program terminations 
we expect this decrease to be partially offset by an increase in company funded r d within commercial systems as we continue to apply our recently certified pro line fusion architecture to certain next generation flight decks for business aircraft 
selling  general and administrative expenses dollars in millions selling  general and administrative expenses percent of total sales selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of personnel  facility and other expenses related to employees not directly engaged in manufacturing or r d activities 
these activities include marketing and business development  finance  legal  information technology and other administrative and management functions 
total sg a expenses increased million  or percent  in compared to  primarily due to the following million from higher employee incentive compensation costs and merit pay increases million increase resulting from the combined impact of pursuing international business opportunities including the opening and staffing of new offices in paris  china and the middle east  higher bid and proposal costs and an increase in other selling costs and activities million of incremental sg a expense from acquisitions  primarily air routing total sg a expenses increased million  or percent  in compared to  primarily due to the following million increase due to the combined impact of incremental sg a expense from the datapath  air routing and seos acquisitions  and higher employee incentive compensation costs million decrease in sg a expense primarily comprised of reductions in employee headcount and other cost savings interest expense in millions interest expense interest expense decreased by million in compared to interest expense increased by million in compared to  primarily due to a full year of interest expense associated with the million of long term debt issued may  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item below for more detail regarding outstanding debt

income tax expense from continuing operations dollars in millions income tax expense effective income tax rate the effective income tax rate differed from the us statutory tax rate as detailed below statutory tax rate state and local income taxes research and development credit domestic manufacturing deduction tax settlements other effective income tax rate the difference between our effective income tax rate in and the statutory tax rate is primarily due to the tax benefits derived from the federal research and development tax credit federal r d tax credit  which provides a tax benefit on certain incremental r d expenditures  and the domestic manufacturing deduction under section dmd  which provides a tax benefit on us based manufacturing 
the effective income tax rate in decreased from primarily due to the retroactive reinstatement of the federal r d tax credit which had previously expired on december  on december   the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of was enacted which reinstated and extended the federal r d tax credit from january  to december  and reduced our effective income tax rate by about percent 
the effective income tax rate in decreased from primarily due to the favorable impact of the internal revenue service irs completing its examination of the taxable years ended september  and  partially offset by differences in the availability of the federal r d tax credit which expired december  the effective income tax rates for  and include a tax benefit related to the dmd 
the dmd tax benefit available in and was being phased in by statute and was therefore lower than the full dmd tax benefit which became effective beginning in fiscal year management believes a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is not necessary because it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be fully realized  except for million of deferred tax assets which have been fully reserved related to foreign net operating losses in sweden and the united kingdom which are not subject to expirations

the increase in net income and diluted earnings per share was primarily the result of higher earnings from commercial systems as discussed in the commercial systems financial results section below  partially offset by a reduction in government systems earnings as discussed in the government systems financial results section below 
the impact of the restructuring and asset impairment charge was included in income from continuing operations while the gain on sale of the divested rollmet business was included in discontinued operations 
the increase in diluted earnings per share was greater than the increase in net income due to the positive impact of our share repurchase program 
net income for decreased percent to million from net income of million for diluted earnings per share decreased percent to for compared to for the decrease in net income and diluted earnings per share was primarily the result of higher expense from increased pension and employee incentive compensation costs and lower earnings from reduced commercial systems sales volume as discussed in the commercial systems financial results section 
these items were partially offset by higher earnings from increased government systems sales volume as discussed in the government systems financial results section  a reduction to the effective income tax rate as discussed in the income taxes section and the absence of restructuring and asset impairment charges which occurred in the restructuring and asset impairment charge primarily related to the closure of a facility in san jose  california and totaled million after income taxes  or million before income taxes 
segment financial results government systems overview and outlook our government systems business provides avionics  communication products  surface solutions and navigation products to the us department of defense  state and local governments  other government agencies  civil agencies  defense contractors and foreign ministries of defense around the world 
these systems  products and services support airborne fixed and rotary wing  ground and shipboard applications 
the short and long term performance of our government systems business is affected by a number of factors  including the amount and prioritization of defense spending by the us and us governments  which is generally based on the security environment and underlying political landscape resulting from budget deficits 
we expect global baseline defense budgets to be constrained as we move into fiscal year we also anticipate our government customers will have reduced procurement budgets and the available funding for r d will decline 
factors driving this decline include reductions in supplemental appropriations that are expected to put further pressure on procurement budgets  as well as the adverse impact resulting from program cancellations and the potential for further cuts to the us department of defense budget caused by the deficit reduction act and a volatile political landscape 
in this market environment  we continue to believe high priority military transformation initiatives and customer demand for cost effective solutions to modernize and extend the life of current systems or to replace systems returning from deployment will lead to funding support for our military communications and electronics equipment 
risks affecting future performance of our government systems business include  but are not limited to potential impact of geopolitical and economic events overall funding and prioritization of the us and us defense budgets delayed  reduced or canceled funding for programs we have won our ability to win new business  successfully develop products and execute on programs pursuant to contractual requirements we expect government systems sales to decrease by low single digits in compared to  driven primarily by the following million reduction from lower production rates for legacy global positioning system gps products as troop deployments wind down in afghanistan and iraq million unfavorable impact from three programs that were terminated by the us government for convenience during lower joint tactical radio system program revenue for the ground mobile radio variant fewer deliveries of iforce public safety vehicle systems the majority of the unfavorable items above are anticipated to be experienced in the first half of fiscal year we expect the above items to be partially offset by sales growth experienced over the full year in the following areas tanker and transport avionics fighter avionics and services hardware for international targeting integration systems simulation and training systems we project government systems segment operating margins will be comparable to the percent segment operating margin reported in as the benefits of restructuring actions and a more favorable contract mix should offset the adverse impact of lower revenue

commercial systems overview and outlook our commercial systems business supplies aviation electronics systems  products and services to customers located throughout the world 
the customer base is comprised of oems of commercial air transport  business and regional aircraft  commercial airlines and business aircraft operators 
the near and long term performance of our commercial systems business is impacted by general worldwide economic health  commercial airline flight hours  corporate profits and the financial condition of airlines worldwide 
we are experiencing positive trends in the commercial markets that we serve 
our air transport oem customers enter fiscal year with a strong backlog and recent order activity that has prompted further increases in their planned aircraft production rates 
we expect the strength of our positions on these platforms to benefit us in the planned production rate increases by the air transport oems also represent a positive sign that airlines expect to see continued favorable traffic trends as we move into additionally  the market for new business jets has begun to recover with some increased demand and build rates anticipated for certain high end and mid sized aircraft classes 
demand for business aircraft at the low end of the market continues to lag as buyers remain cautious to commit capital towards the purchase of new aircraft 
we expect deliveries of business and regional jets in to increase as compared to we expect a favorable commercial aftermarket environment due to continued increases in air transport passenger traffic  business jet utilization and airline capacity 
the entry into service of the boeing and aircraft is expected to drive additional demand for our aftermarket products and services as airlines provision initial spares in anticipation of aircraft delivery 
additionally  stronger airline and corporate profitability is expected to drive increases in demand for our retrofit and spare products 
risks to the commercial systems business include  among other things turbulence in global economic and financial markets could have a significant impact on demand for air travel  airline demand for new aircraft and the availability of financing for new aircraft occurrence of an unexpected geopolitical event  or pandemic  that could have a significant impact on demand for air travel and airline demand for new aircraft potential negative impact that fuel prices could have on the profitability of airline and other aircraft operator customers our ability to develop products and execute on programs pursuant to contractual requirements development and market acceptance of our products and systems potential adverse impact from delays in aircraft production rate schedules at the oems  including delays in the entry into service date for new aircraft we expect commercial systems sales to increase by low double digits in compared to  primarily due to the following sales to aircraft oems are expected to increase in the low teens as a result of the entry into service and ramp up in production of the boeing and and the bombardier global and gulfstream g aircraft  as well as planned production rate increases across both air transport and business jet manufacturers aftermarket sales are expected to experience growth in the low teens due to continued increases in air transport passenger traffic and business jet utilization  as well as increased retrofit and initial sparing activities in the air transport market as airlines take delivery of next generation aircraft the above items are expected to be partially offset by an estimated reduction of million in sales of wide body in flight entertainment ife products and services due to our decision in to cease investing in this product area we project commercial systems operating margins will expand by approximately basis points above the percent reported in  driven primarily by the anticipated revenue increase

the decrease in pension expense in compared to was primarily due to the change in amortization period of actuarial gains and losses from years in to years in the higher pension expense in compared to was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of a decrease in the discount rate used to measure pension expense from percent in to percent in during  the funded status of our pension plans went from a deficit of  million at september  to a deficit of  million at september   primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate used to measure our us pension obligations from percent at september  to percent at september  in addition  the funded status was adversely impacted by a reduction in plan assets during during  the funded status of our pension plans went from a deficit of  at september  to a deficit of  million at september   primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate used to measure our us pension obligations from percent at september  to percent at september   partially offset by an increase in plan assets driven by improved market returns in we expect defined benefit pension income of million in  compared to million of pension income in the expected million reduction in pension income from to is primarily due to an increase in the amortization of net actuarial losses driven by the unfavorable impact of low discount rates and declines in asset values over recent years  partially offset by lower interest costs due to the decrease in the discount rate used to calculate pension expense 
our objective with respect to the funding of our pension plans is to provide adequate assets for the payment of future benefits 
pursuant to this objective  we will fund our pension plans as required by governmental regulations and may consider discretionary contributions as conditions warrant 
we believe our strong financial position continues to provide us the opportunity to make contributions to our pension fund without inhibiting our ability to pursue strategic investments 
in october  subsequent to our year end  we made a million contribution to our us qualified pension plan 
we plan to contribute an additional million in for a total million contribution  which we anticipate will fully satisfy the minimum statutory funding requirements for any additional future contributions necessary to satisfy the minimum statutory funding requirements are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rates 
we may elect to make additional discretionary contributions during to further improve the funded status of this plan 
contributions to our non us plans and our non us non qualified plan are expected to total million in other retirement benefits we have historically provided retiree medical and life insurance benefits to substantially all of our employees 
we have undertaken two major actions over the past several years with respect to these benefits that have lowered both the current and future costs of providing these benefits in july of  the pre and post retiree medical plans were amended to discontinue benefits for employees hired after september  and establish a fixed company contribution 
additional premium contributions will be required from participants for all costs in excess of this fixed contribution amount 
this amendment eliminated the risk to us related to health care cost escalations for retiree medical benefits going forward as additional contributions will be required from retirees for all costs in excess of our fixed contribution amount as a result of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  we amended our retiree medical plans on june  to discontinue post prescription drug coverage effective january  post retirees have the option of receiving these benefits through medicare 
we believe the medicare prescription drug benefit is generally better than the benefit that was provided by our discontinued post drug plan other retirement benefits expense for the years ended september   and was million  million and million  respectively 
we expect other retirement benefits expense of approximately million in financial condition and liquidity cash flow summary our ability to generate significant cash flow from operating activities coupled with our expected ability to access the credit markets enables us to execute our growth strategies and return value to our shareowners 
the timing of our cash inflows is historically heavily weighted towards the second half of our fiscal year  particularly to our fourth quarter 
we expect this trend to continue in the future 
during  we made million of pension plan contributions and also made significant cash expenditures aimed at future growth and enhanced shareowner value  as shown below million of cash payments for share repurchases million of capital expenditures million of dividend payments million related to the acquisitions of blue ridge simulation  inc and computing technologies for aviation  inc 
operating activities in millions cash provided by operating activities the million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in compared to was primarily due to the following payments for inventory and other operating costs increased million to  million in compared to  million in the increase was primarily due to increased costs associated with the higher sales volume in discussed in the results of operations section above and an increase in inventory  primarily driven by i higher pre production engineering costs  as explained in greater detail within the critical accounting policies section below  and resulting from increased effort on programs such as the airbus a  various bombardier platforms in the business jet market  and several international rotary and fixed wing programs within government systems ii higher inventory resulting from the adverse impact of delayed funding authorizations from the us government  an increase to accommodate a transitional period of relocating certain production effort to other existing facilities  and increased component parts purchased to mitigate supply chain risks in light of the earthquake and tsunami in japan payments for employee incentive pay increased million in compared to incentive pay is expensed in the year it is incurred and paid in the first fiscal quarter of the following year 
during  million was paid for employee incentive pay costs incurred during no incentive pay costs were incurred for the full year  accordingly  there was no payment for incentive pay the above items were partially offset by an increase in cash receipts from customers of million to  million in compared to  million in  primarily due to the higher sales volume in as discussed in the results of operations section above and higher collections of receivables from customers  including higher progress payments received in advance of revenue recognition payments for income taxes decreased million to million in compared to million in primarily due to the timing of cash tax payments related to the retroactive extension of the federal r d tax credit the million increase in cash provided by operating activities in compared to was primarily due to the following payments for employee incentive pay decreased million in compared to incentive pay is expensed in the year it is incurred and paid in the first fiscal quarter of the following year 
during  million was paid for employee incentive pay costs incurred during no incentive pay costs were incurred for the full year  accordingly  there was no payment for incentive pay cash receipts from customers increased million to  million in compared to  million in  primarily due to the higher sales volume in as discussed in the results of operations section above and higher advances from government related contracts for financing of inventory payments for income taxes decreased million to million in compared to million in primarily due to lower estimated taxable income in pension contributions decreased million in compared to the above items were partially offset by a million increase in payments for inventory and other operating costs to  million in compared to  million in the increase was primarily due to increased costs associated with the higher sales volume in discussed in the results of operations section above and inventory purchases for anticipated production volume in cash provided by operating activities is expected to be in the range of million to million 
the projected range of cash provided by operating activities accommodates a million expected contribution to our us qualified defined benefit pension plan and a projected million net increase in pre production engineering costs 
we expect a majority of the projected operating cash flow to be generated in the second half of our fiscal year 
investing activities in millions cash used for investing activities the million reduction in cash used for investing activities in compared to was primarily due to the following in we received million in proceeds from the divestiture of the rollmet business and million in proceeds from the disposition of property compared to million received from the disposition of property in in we acquired blue ridge simulation  inc and computing technologies for aviation  inc for million compared to the acquisition of air routing for million we received million from the sale of a short term investment of excess cash in germany in which was purchased for million in the above items were partially offset by a million increase in property additions in compared to in addition  we entered into an agreement with bombardier  inc in april to provide them million of cash on a short term basis in connection with their global vision aircraft program 
bombardier repaid the amount in full in june of  in accordance with the terms of our agreement the million reduction in cash used for investing activities in compared to was primarily due to the following in we acquired air routing for million compared to the acquisitions of datapath and seos for million million reduction in property additions in compared to the above items were partially offset by million of short term investments purchased in by a non us subsidiary financing activities in millions cash used for financing activities the million increase in cash used for financing activities in compared to was primarily due to the following cash repurchases of common stock increased million to million in from million in repayment of short term borrowings increased by million in as short term debt of million outstanding at the end of was repaid during cash proceeds from stock option exercises decreased million to million in from million in the million increase in cash used for financing activities in compared to was primarily due to the following cash repurchases of common stock increased million to million in from million in the above item was mostly offset by changes in other financing activities  including higher cash proceeds and tax benefits from stock option exercises share repurchase program strong cash flow from operations provided funds for repurchasing our common stock under our share repurchase program as follows in millions  except per share amounts amount of share repurchases number of shares repurchased weighted average price per share approximately and million of the and share repurchases reflected in the table above are included within accounts payable at september  and  respectively  and are reflected as a non cash transaction in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
dividends we declared and paid cash dividends of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
based on our current dividend policy  we will pay quarterly cash dividends which  on an annual basis  will equal per share 
we expect to fund dividends using cash generated from operations 
the declaration and payment of future dividends is at the sole discretion of the board of directors 
financial condition and liquidity we have historically maintained a capital structure characterized by conservative levels of debt outstanding that enables us sufficient access to credit markets 
when combined with our ability to generate strong levels of cash flow from our operations  this capital structure provides the strength and flexibility necessary to pursue strategic growth opportunities and to return value to our shareowners 
a comparison of key elements of our financial condition as of september  and are as follows september dollars in millions cash and cash equivalents short term investments short term debt long term debt  net net debt total equity   debt to total capitalization net debt to total capitalization calculated as total of short term and long term debt  net total debt  less cash and cash equivalents and short term investments calculated as total debt divided by the sum of total debt plus total equity calculated as net debt divided by the sum of net debt plus total equity we primarily fund our contractual obligations  capital expenditures  small to medium sized acquisitions  dividends and share repurchases from cash generated from operating activities 
approximately half of our cash and cash equivalents resides at non us locations and may not be readily accessible for use in the us due to potential adverse income tax implications and other statutory limitations 
due to the fluctuations of cash flows  we supplement our internally generated cash flow from time to time by issuing short term commercial paper 
under our commercial paper program  we may sell up to million face amount of unsecured short term promissory notes in the commercial paper market 
the commercial paper notes have maturities of not more than days from the date of issuance 
at september   there were no short term commercial paper borrowings outstanding 
the maximum amount of short term borrowings outstanding during was million and was primarily the result of borrowings to fund a million cash advance we provided to bombardier  inc in april that was repaid in full in june  in accordance with the terms of our agreement with bombardier 
we provided the cash advance to bombardier to assist them by offsetting some delays they experienced in receiving customer advance payments on their global vision aircraft program 
at september   there were no outstanding short term commercial paper borrowings 
in the event our access to the commercial paper markets is impaired  we have access to an million revolving credit facility through a network of banks that matures in  with options to further extend the term for up to two one year periods and or increase the aggregate principal amount up to billion 
these options are subject to the approval of the lenders 
our only financial covenant under the revolving credit facility requires that we maintain a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio of not greater than percent  excluding the accumulated other comprehensive loss equity impact related to defined benefit retirement plans 
our debt to total capitalization ratio at september  based on this financial covenant was percent 
we had no borrowings at september  under our revolving credit facility 
in addition  alternative sources of liquidity could include funds available from the issuance of equity securities  debt securities and potential asset securitization strategies 
we have a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission pursuant to which we can publicly offer and sell securities from time to time 
this shelf registration covers an unlimited amount of debt securities  common stock and preferred stock or warrants that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of sale 
to date  we have not raised capital through the issuance of equity securities as we prefer to use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase our return on shareowners equity 
to fund share repurchases  we plan to incur million of additional debt in credit ratings are a significant factor in determining our ability to access short term and long term financing as well as the cost of such financing in terms of interest rates 
our strong credit ratings have enabled continued access to both short and long term credit markets 
if our credit ratings were to be adjusted downward by the rating agencies  the implications of such actions could include impairment or elimination of our access to credit markets and an increase in the cost of borrowing 
the following is a summary of our credit ratings as of september  credit rating agency short term rating long term rating outlook fitch ratings f a stable moody s investors service p a stable standard poor s a a stable we were in compliance with all debt covenants at september  and september  off balance sheet arrangements as of september   other than operating leases  we had no material off balance sheet arrangements  including guarantees  retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities  derivative instruments indexed to our stock and classified in shareowners equity on our consolidated statement of financial position or variable interests in entities that provide financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to our company 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes certain of our contractual obligations as of september   as well as when these obligations are expected to be satisfied payments due by period less than in millions total year years years thereafter long term debt interest on long term debt non cancelable operating leases purchase obligations purchase orders purchase contracts total  interest payments under long term debt obligations exclude the potential effects of the related interest rate swap contracts 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
we lease certain office and manufacturing facilities as well as certain machinery and equipment under various lease contracts with terms that meet the accounting definition of operating leases 
our commitments under these operating leases  in the form of non cancelable future lease payments  are not reflected as a liability on our consolidated statement of financial position 
purchase obligations include purchase orders and purchase contracts 
purchase orders are executed in the normal course of business and may or may not be cancelable 
purchase contracts include agreements with suppliers under which there is a commitment to buy a minimum amount of products or pay a specified amount regardless of actual need 
generally  items represented in purchase obligations are not reflected as liabilities on our consolidated statement of financial position 
the table excludes obligations with respect to pension and other post retirement benefit plans see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
we plan to contribute million to our us qualified pension plan in  which will fully satisfy the minimum statutory funding requirements for in october  subsequent to fiscal year end  million of this amount was contributed to the plan 
for years beyond  the actual amounts required to be contributed to our us qualified pension plan are dependent upon  among other things  interest rates and underlying asset returns 
due to the current uncertainty of the amounts used to compute our expected pension plan funding  we believe it is not practicable to reasonably estimate such future funding for periods in excess of one year 
with the exception of certain bargaining unit plans  payments due under other post retirement benefit plans are funded as the expenses are incurred 
in addition  the table excludes liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits  which totaled million at september   as we cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of cash settlements to the respective taxing authorities see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
the following table reflects certain of our commercial commitments as of september  amount of commitment expiration by period total amount less than in millions committed year years years thereafter letters of credit see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below for a discussion of letters of credit 
in addition to the obligations disclosed above  we occasionally enter into offset agreements  required by certain customers in some non us countries  as a condition to obtaining contract awards for our products and services 
these agreements  which generally extend over several years  are customary in our industry and are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the country in which our customers operate 
these commitments may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash  including transfer of technology  providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in country projects  strategic alliances and transactions conducted by third parties eg  our vendors 
these agreements may also be satisfied through our use of cash for activities such as placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies and or services  building or leasing facilities for in country operations  in country employment of a non us country citizen and other forms of assistance in the applicable country 
the offset rules and regulations  as well as the underlying contracts  may differ from one country to another 
we typically do not commit to offset agreements until contract awards for our products or services are definitive 
should we be unable to meet the offset obligations we may be subject to contractual penalties  and our chances of receiving additional business from the applicable customers could be reduced or  in certain cases  eliminated 
we historically have not been required to pay material penalties related to offset obligations and are currently in compliance with our offset commitments 
at september   we had outstanding offset obligations totaling approximately million that extend through the amounts ultimately applied against our offset requirements are based on negotiations with the customer and the cost to fulfill the obligation is typically only a fraction of the original obligation above

critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect our financial condition and results of operations that are reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as well as the related disclosure of assets and liabilities contingent upon future events 
understanding the critical accounting policies discussed below and related risks is important in evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are critical to our financial condition and results of operations as they involve a significant use of management judgment on matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results differ significantly from management estimates  there could be a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
management regularly discusses the identification and development of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
accounting for long term contracts a substantial portion of our sales to government customers and certain of our sales to commercial customers are made pursuant to long term contracts requiring development and delivery of products over several years and often contain fixed price purchase options for additional products 
certain of these contracts are accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
sales and earnings under the percentage of completion method are recorded either as products are shipped under the units of delivery method for production effort  or based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to total estimated costs expected to be incurred related to the contract under the cost to cost method for development effort 
the percentage of completion method of accounting requires management to estimate the profit margin for each individual contract and to apply that profit margin on a uniform basis as sales are recorded under the contract 
the estimation of profit margins requires management to make projections of the total sales to be generated and the total costs that will be incurred under a contract 
these projections require management to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as the complexity of design and related development costs  performance of subcontractors  availability and cost of materials  labor productivity and cost  overhead and capital costs and manufacturing efficiency 
these contracts often include purchase options for additional quantities and customer change orders for additional or revised product functionality 
sales and costs related to profitable purchase options are included in our estimates only when the options are exercised while sales and costs related to unprofitable purchase options are included in our estimates when exercise is determined to be probable 
sales related to change orders are included in profit estimates only if they can be reliably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured 
purchase options and change orders are accounted for either as an integral part of the original contract or separately depending upon the nature and value of the item 
anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which losses become probable and estimable 
estimates of profit margins for contracts are typically reviewed by management on a quarterly basis 
assuming the initial estimates of sales and costs under a contract are accurate  the percentage of completion method results in the profit margin being recorded evenly as revenue is recognized under the contract 
changes in these underlying estimates due to revisions in sales and cost estimates  the combining of contracts or the exercise of contract options may result in profit margins being recognized unevenly over a contract as such changes are accounted for on a cumulative basis in the period estimates are revised 
significant changes in estimates related to accounting for long term contracts may have a material effect on our results of operations in the period in which the revised estimate is made 
program investments we defer certain pre production engineering costs in inventories  net and record up front sales incentives in intangible assets collectively referred to as program investments 
these program investments are amortized over their estimated useful lives  up to a maximum of years 
estimated useful lives are limited to the amount of time we are virtually assured to earn revenues through a contractually enforceable right included in long term supply arrangements with our customers 
this provides the best matching of expense over the related period of benefit 
the following provides an overview of the program investments september in millions pre production engineering costs up front sales incentives total program investments we defer the cost of certain pre production engineering costs incurred during the development phase of a program in connection with long term supply arrangements that contain contractual guarantees for reimbursement from customers 
these customer guarantees generally take the form of a minimum order quantity with quantified reimbursement amounts if the minimum order quantity is not taken by the customer 
these costs are deferred in inventories  net to the extent of the contractual guarantees and are amortized over their estimated useful lives  up to years  using a units of delivery method 
this amortization expense is included as a component of cost of sales  within customer funded research and development expense 
amortization is based on our expectation of delivery rates on a program by program basis and begins when we start recognizing revenue as we deliver equipment for the program 
the estimated useful life is limited to the amount of time we are virtually assured to earn revenues through a contractually enforceable right included in long term supply arrangements with our customers 
pre production engineering costs in excess of the contractual guarantee  and costs incurred pursuant to supply arrangements that do not contain customer guarantees for reimbursement  are expensed as incurred 
we also provide up front sales incentives prior to delivering products or performing services to certain commercial customers in connection with sales contracts 
up front sales incentives are recorded as a customer relationship intangible asset and are amortized over the period we have received a contractually enforceable right related to the incentives  up to years  using a units of delivery method 
amortization is based on our expectation of delivery rates on a program by program basis 
amortization begins when we start recognizing revenue as we deliver equipment for the program 
up front sales incentives consisting of cash payments or customer account credits are amortized as a reduction of sales  whereas incentives consisting of free products are amortized as cost of sales 
risks inherent in recovering the value of our program investments include  but are not limited to  the following changes in market conditions may affect product sales under a program 
in particular  the commercial aerospace market has been historically cyclical and subject to downturns during periods of weak economic conditions  which could be prompted or exacerbated by political or other domestic or international events bankruptcy or other significant financial difficulties of our customers our ability to produce products could be impacted by the performance of subcontractors  the availability of specialized materials and other production risks we evaluate the carrying amount of program investments for recovery at least annually or when potential indicators of impairment exist  such as a change in the estimated number of products to be delivered under a program 
no impairment charges related to program investments were recorded in  or while we believe our program investments are recoverable over time  the cancellation of a program by a customer would represent the most significant impairment factor related to program investments 
due to the long term nature of the procurement cycle and the significant investment required to bring a program to market in the aerospace and defense industry  we believe the likelihood of a customer abruptly canceling a program is remote 
we also evaluate our amortization of program investments quarterly based on our expectation of delivery rates on a program by program basis 
the impact of changes in expected delivery rates on the program investments amortization is adjusted as needed on a prospective basis 
there were no significant changes in the rate of program investment amortization and no significant cumulative adjustments recorded in  and amortization expense for pre production engineering costs and up front sales incentives for  and was as follows in millions amortization of pre production engineering amortization of up front sales incentives total amortization of program investments as disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the weighted average amortization period for pre production engineering costs is approximately years 
as disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the weighted average amortization period for up front sales incentives is approximately years 
anticipated amortization expense for program investments for fiscal years and beyond is summarized below in millions thereafter anticipated amortization expense for pre production engineering costs anticipated amortization expense for up front sales incentives total anticipated amortization for program investments pre production engineering costs comprise percent of our total inventory balance at september   compared to percent in the prior year 
pre production engineering costs have increased million from september  to september   attributable to a million increase within commercial systems and an additional million increase within government systems 
additionally  up front sales incentives to commercial systems customers increased million from september  to september  this recent growth in our program investments was driven primarily by the expanded market share our company successfully captured over the past several years 
commercial systems has secured positions on several key platforms in the air transport market  including the boeing  boeing and airbus a in the business and regional jet market  our pro line fusion avionics system has been selected by customers around the globe  including bombardier  embraer  gulfstream  and mitsubishi 
our customers have provided us a contractual guarantee for reimbursement on several of these new programs  as such  our capitalized pre production engineering costs have increased for these programs as the company continues development efforts 
our government systems business has also contributed to the recent growth in pre production engineering costs  as we begin to ramp up efforts on several international rotary and fixed wing programs that we recently won 
we expect the long term supply arrangements resulting from these recent program wins to deliver significant revenues and profits to us over the next several years  continuing over the life of the aircraft platforms which can range from ten to twenty years  as such  we believe our program investments are recoverable 
we expect the balance of our capitalized program investment costs will continue to increase over the next several years  through at least fiscal year we primarily fund our program investments with cash generated from operating activities 
looking forward to  we expect cash provided by operating activities to be in the range of million to million 
this guidance accommodates an anticipated million increase in pre production engineering costs net of amortization  primarily attributable to commercial systems effort on the airbus a and across multiple bombardier platforms 
income taxes at the end of each quarterly reporting period  we estimate an effective income tax rate that is expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year 
the estimate of our effective income tax rate involves significant judgments resulting from uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations across many jurisdictions  implementation of tax planning strategies and estimates as to the jurisdictions where income is expected to be earned 
these estimates may be further complicated by new laws  new interpretations of existing laws and rulings by taxing authorities 
due to the subjectivity and complex nature of these underlying issues  our actual effective income tax rate and related tax liabilities may differ from our initial estimates 
differences between our estimated and actual effective income tax rates and related liabilities are recorded in the period they become known or as our estimates are revised based on additional information 
the resulting adjustment to our income tax expense could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period the adjustment is recorded 
a one percentage point change in our effective income tax rate would change our annual income from continuing operations by approximately million 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for tax carryforwards and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
the future realization of our deferred tax assets ultimately depends on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character for example  ordinary income or capital gains within the carryback and carryforward periods available under the tax law and  to a lesser extent  our ability to execute successful tax planning strategies 
management believes it is more likely than not that the current and long term deferred tax assets will be realized through the reduction of future taxable income  except for deferred tax assets which have been fully reserved and relate to foreign net operating losses 
a change in the ability of our operations to continue to generate future taxable income  or our ability to implement desired tax planning strategies  could affect our ability to realize the future tax deductions underlying our net deferred tax assets  and require us to provide a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
the recognition of a valuation allowance would result in a reduction to net income and if significant  could have a material impact on our effective tax rate  results of operations and financial position in any given period 
as part of the determination of our tax liability  management exercises considerable judgment in evaluating tax positions taken by us in determining the income tax provision and establishes reserves for tax contingencies in accordance with the income taxes topic of the fasb accounting standards codification 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below for further detail regarding unrecognized tax benefits  deferred taxes and the factors considered in evaluating deferred tax asset realization 
goodwill as of september   we had million of goodwill related to various business acquisitions 
we perform impairment tests on goodwill on an annual basis during the second quarter of each fiscal year  or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that impairment has occurred 
goodwill is potentially impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit that contains the goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
the fair values of our reporting units are determined using a combination of an income approach  which estimates fair value based upon future discounted cash flows  and a market approach  which estimates fair value using market multiples  ratios and valuations of a set of comparable public companies within our industry 
the valuation methodology and underlying financial information that is used to estimate the fair value of our reporting units requires significant judgments to be made by management 
these judgments include  but are not limited to  the long term projections of future financial performance and the selection of appropriate discount rates used to present value future cash flows 
our five year strategic operating plan serves as the basis for these valuations and represents our best estimate of future business conditions in our industry as well as our ability to compete 
discount rates are determined based upon the weighted average cost of capital for a set of comparable companies adjusted for risks associated with our different operations 
our goodwill impairment tests that were performed in the second quarter of  and yielded no impairments 
in addition  based upon the results of our impairment testing  none of our reporting units were at risk of their carrying value of net assets exceeding their respective fair value 
if there were a significant downturn in our business  we could incur a goodwill impairment 
warranty accrued liabilities are recorded on our consolidated statement of financial position to reflect our contractual obligations relating to warranty commitments to our customers 
we provide warranty coverage of various lengths and terms to our customers depending on standard offerings and negotiated contractual agreements 
we record an estimate for warranty expense at the time of sale based on historical warranty return rates and repair costs 
we believe our primary source of warranty risk relates to extended warranty terms 
as shown in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below  the carrying amount of accrued product warranty costs has declined million from a balance of million at september   to a balance of million at september  this trend is driven by a variety of factors 
within commercial systems  sales declined in and  resulting in a lower provision for product warranty expenses 
in addition  a primary source of warranty risk for commercial systems in the past related to sales of wide body in flight entertainment products and systems 
as discussed in the commercial systems results of operations section above  sales related to wide body ife have declined significantly over the past several years due to the company previously announced decision to cease investing in this product area 
as sales volumes related to wide body ife continue to decline and warranty periods on these legacy products expire  our warranty reserve balance has also been reduced 
product reliability improvements have also favorably impacted incurred warranty costs within commercial systems  contributing to a lower warranty reserve 
the remaining decrease in our accrued warranty balance is primarily attributable to certain favorable adjustments recorded by government systems in and to reduce warranty reserves for changes in estimate  as discussed in the government systems results of operations section above 
should future warranty experience differ materially from our historical experience  we may be required to record additional warranty liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the period in which these additional liabilities are required 
pension benefits we historically provided retirement benefits to most of our employees in the form of defined benefit pension plans 
accounting standards require the cost of providing these pension plans be measured on an actuarial basis 
these accounting standards will generally reduce  but not eliminate  the volatility of pension expense as actuarial gains and losses resulting from both normal year to year changes in valuation assumptions and the differences from actual experience are deferred and amortized 
the application of these accounting standards requires management to make numerous assumptions and judgments that can significantly affect these measurements 
critical assumptions made by management in performing these actuarial valuations include the selection of discount rates and expectations on the future rate of return on pension plan assets 
discount rates are used to determine the present value of our pension obligations and also affect the amount of pension expense recorded in any given period 
we estimate this discount rate based on the rates of return of high quality  fixed income investments with maturity dates that reflect the expected time horizon that benefits will be paid see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
changes in the discount rate could have a material effect on our reported pension obligations and would also impact the related pension expense 
the expected rate of return is our estimate of the long term earnings rate on our pension plan assets and is based upon both historical long term actual and expected future investment returns considering the current investment mix of plan assets 
differences between the actual and expected rate of return on plan assets can impact our expense for pension benefits 
holding all other factors constant  the estimated impact on pension income and pension benefit obligation for our us plans caused by hypothetical changes to key assumptions is as follows in millions change in assumption assumption basis point increase basis point decrease pension projected benefit pension projected benefit pension obligation discount rate obligation decrease obligation increase decrease to pension expected long term rate of return on plan assets additional pension income income as disclosed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item below  beginning in  actuarial gains and losses including those resulting from a change in the pension obligation discount rate are amortized over the expected future life expectancy of inactive participants  or about years 
in  actuarial gains and losses were amortized over the average remaining service period of active participants  or about years 
this change in pension amortization period was the primary factor impacting the million decrease in pension expense from to this change in amortization period also resulted in our pension expense income being less sensitive to changes in the discount rate assumption 
an increase or decrease of basis points in the pension obligation discount rate would impact pension income by less than million 
inventory valuation reserves inventory valuation reserves are recorded in order to report inventories at the lower of cost or market value on our consolidated statement of financial position 
the determination of inventory valuation reserves requires management to make estimates and judgments on the future salability of inventories 
valuation reserves for excess  obsolete and slow moving inventory are estimated by comparing the inventory levels of individual parts to both future sales forecasts or production requirements and historical usage rates in order to identify inventory that is unlikely to be sold above cost 
other factors that management considers in determining these reserves include overall market conditions and other inventory management initiatives 
management can generally react to reduce the likelihood of severe excess and slow moving inventory issues by changing purchasing behavior  although abrupt changes in market conditions can limit our ability to react quickly 
management believes its primary source of risk for excess and obsolete inventory is derived from life time buy inventory 
life time buy inventory consists of inventory that is typically no longer being produced by our vendors but for which we purchase multiple years of supply in order to meet production and service requirements over the life span of a product 
total life time buy inventory on hand at september  was million 
excluding pre production engineering costs and progress payments  we had million of gross inventory on hand at september  with million of inventory valuation reserves 
although management believes these reserves are adequate  any abrupt changes in market conditions may require us to record additional inventory valuation reserves which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which these additional reserves are required 
pre production engineering costs are discussed in the program investments section of our critical accounting policies above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in addition to using cash provided by normal operating activities  we utilize a combination of short term and long term debt to finance operations 
our operating results and cash flows are exposed to changes in interest rates that could adversely affect the amount of interest expense incurred and paid on debt obligations in any given period 
in addition  changes in interest rates can affect the fair value of our debt obligations 
such changes in fair value are only relevant to the extent these debt obligations are settled prior to maturity 
we manage our exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt and when considered necessary  we may employ financial instruments in the form of interest rate swaps to help meet this objective 
at september   we had million of percent fixed rate long term debt obligations outstanding with a carrying value of million and a fair value of million 
in november we converted million of this fixed rate debt to floating rate debt bearing interest at six month libor less 
percent by executing receive fixed  pay variable interest rate swap contracts 
at september   we also had million of percent fixed rate long term debt obligations outstanding with a carrying value of million and a fair value of million
