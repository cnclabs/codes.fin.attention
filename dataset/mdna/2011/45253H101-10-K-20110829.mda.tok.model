item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since our inception  we have been principally engaged in the development of novel  targeted therapeutics for the treatment of cancer using our expertise in cancer biology  monoclonal antibodies  highly potent cytotoxic  or cell killing  agents  and the design of linkers that enable these agents to be stably attached to the antibodies while in the blood stream and released in their fully active form after delivery to a cancer cell 
an anticancer compound made using our targeted antibody payload  or tap  technology consists of a monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to an antigen target found on cancer cells with multiple copies of one of our proprietary cell killing agents attached using one of our engineered linkers 
its antibody component enables a tap compound to bind specifically to cancer cells that express a particular target antigen  the highly potent cytotoxic agent serves to kill the cancer cell  and the engineered linker controls the release and activation of the cytotoxic agent inside the cancer cell 
our tap technology is designed to enable the creation of highly effective  well tolerated anticancer products 
all of our and our collaborative partners tap compounds currently in preclinical and clinical testing contain either dm or dm as the cytotoxic agent 
both dm and dm  collectively dmx  are our proprietary derivatives of a naturally occurring substance called maytansine 
we also use our expertise in antibodies and cancer biology to develop naked  or non conjugated  antibody anticancer product candidates 
we have entered into collaborative agreements that enable companies to use our tap technology to develop commercial product candidates to specified targets 
we have also used our proprietary tap technology in conjunction with our in house antibody expertise to develop our own anticancer product candidates 
under the terms of our collaborative agreements  we are generally entitled to upfront fees  milestone payments  and royalties on any commercial product sales 
in addition  under certain 
table of contents agreements we are entitled to research and development funding based on activities performed at our collaborative partner request 
we are reimbursed for our direct and a portion of overhead costs to manufacture preclinical and clinical materials and  under certain collaborative agreements  the reimbursement includes a profit margin 
currently  our collaborative partners include amgen  bayer healthcare  biotest  novartis  roche and sanofi 
we expect that substantially all of our revenue for the foreseeable future will result from payments under our collaborative arrangements 
details for some of our major and recent collaborative agreements can be found in this form k under item business 
to date  we have not generated revenues from commercial product sales and we expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future 
as of june   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents compared to million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of june  we anticipate that future cash expenditures will be partially offset by collaboration derived proceeds  including milestone payments  royalties and upfront fees 
accordingly  period to period operational results may fluctuate dramatically based upon the timing of receipt of the proceeds 
we believe that our established collaborative agreements  while subject to specified milestone achievements  will provide funding to assist us in meeting obligations under our collaborative agreements while also assisting in providing funding for the development of internal product candidates and technologies 
however  we can give no assurances that such collaborative agreement funding will  in fact  be realized in the time frames we expect  or at all 
should we or our partners not meet some or all of the terms and conditions of our various collaboration agreements  we may be required to secure alternative financing arrangements and or defer or limit some or all of our research  development and or clinical projects 
however  we cannot provide assurance that any such opportunities presented by additional strategic partners or alternative financing arrangements will be entirely available to us  if at all 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our collaborative agreements  inventory and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we enter into licensing and development agreements with collaborative partners for the development of monoclonal antibody based anticancer therapeutics 
the terms of these agreements contain multiple deliverables which may include i licenses  or options to obtain licenses  to our tap technology  ii rights to future technological improvements  iii research activities to be performed on behalf of the collaborative partner  and iv the manufacture of preclinical or clinical materials for the collaborative partner 
payments to us under these agreements may include non refundable license fees  option fees  exercise fees  payments for research activities  payments for the manufacture of preclinical or clinical materials  payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones and royalties on product sales 
we follow the provisions of asc topic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  and asu no 
 revenue recognition milestone method  in accounting for these agreements 
effective july   we adopted asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  which amends asc topic in order to account for these agreements  we must 
table of contents identify the deliverables included within the agreement and evaluate which deliverables represent separate units of accounting based on whether certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has standalone value to the collaborator 
the consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
at june   we had the following three types of agreements with the parties identified below exclusive development and commercialization licenses to use our tap technology and or certain other intellectual property to develop compounds to a single target antigen exclusive licenses amgen two single target licenses bayer healthcare one single target license biotest one single target license roche  through its genentech unit five single target licenses sanofi license to multiple individual targets option research agreement for a defined period of time to secure development and commercialization licenses to use our tap technology to develop anticancer compounds to a limited number of targets on established terms broad option agreement amgen sanofi novartis non exclusive license to our humanization technology sanofi there are no performance  cancellation  termination or refund provisions in any of our arrangements that contain material financial consequences to us 
exclusive licenses the deliverables under an exclusive license agreement generally include the exclusive license to our tap technology  and may also include deliverables related to rights to future technological improvements  research activities to be performed on behalf of the collaborative partner and the manufacture of preclinical or clinical materials for the collaborative partner 
generally  exclusive license agreements contain non refundable terms for payments and  depending on the terms of the agreement  provide that we will i at the collaborator request  provide research services which are reimbursed at a contractually determined rate  ii at the collaborator request  manufacture and provide to them preclinical and clinical materials which are reimbursed at our cost  or  in some cases  cost plus a margin  iii earn payments upon the achievement of certain milestones and iv earn royalty payments  generally until the later of the last applicable patent expiration or to years after product launch 
royalty rates may vary over the royalty term depending on our intellectual property rights 
we may provide technical assistance and share any technology improvements with our collaborators during the term of the collaboration agreements 
we do not directly control when any collaborator will request research or manufacturing services  achieve milestones or become liable for royalty payments 
as a result  we cannot predict when we will recognize revenues in connection with any of the foregoing 

table of contents in determining the units of accounting  management evaluates whether the exclusive license has standalone value  from the undelivered elements  to the collaborative partner based on the consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances for each arrangement 
factors considered in this determination include the research capabilities of the partner and the availability of tap technology research expertise in the general marketplace 
if we can conclude that the license has stand alone value and therefore will be accounted for as a separate unit of accounting  we then determine the estimated selling prices of the license and all other units of accounting based on market conditions  similar arrangements entered into by third parties  and entity specific factors such as the terms of our previous collaborative agreements  recent preclinical and clinical testing results of therapeutic products that use our tap technology  our pricing practices and pricing objectives  the likelihood that technological improvements will be made  the likelihood that technological improvements made will be used by our collaborators and the nature of the research services to be performed on behalf of our collaborators and market rates for similar services 
upfront payments on single target licenses are deferred if facts and circumstances dictate that the license does not have standalone value 
the determination of the length of the period over which to defer revenue is subject to judgment and estimation and can have an impact on the amount of revenue recognized in a given period 
our employees are generally available to assist our collaborators during the development of their products 
we generally estimate this development phase to begin at the inception of the collaboration agreement and conclude at the end of non pivotal phase ii testing 
we believe this period of involvement is  depending on the nature of the license  on average six and one half years 
quarterly  we reassess our periods of substantial involvement over which we amortize our upfront license fees and make adjustments as appropriate 
in the event a collaborator elects to discontinue development of a specific product candidate under a single target license  but retains its right to use our technology to develop an alternative product candidate to the same target or a target substitute  we would cease amortization of any remaining portion of the upfront fee until there is substantial preclinical activity on another product candidate and its remaining period of substantial involvement can be estimated 
in the event that a single target license were to be terminated  we would recognize as revenue any portion of the upfront fee that had not previously been recorded as revenue  but was classified as deferred revenue  at the date of such termination 
upfront payments on single target licenses may be recognized upon delivery of the license if facts and circumstances dictate that the license has standalone value from the undelivered elements  which generally include rights to future technological improvements  research services and the manufacture of preclinical and clinical materials 
we recognize revenue related to research services that represent separate units of accounting as they are performed  as long as there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the related receivable is probable 
we recognize revenue related to the rights to future technological improvements over the estimated period that the rights will be in force 
we may also produce preclinical and clinical materials for our collaborators 
we are reimbursed for our direct costs and a portion of our overhead costs to produce clinical materials 
we recognize revenue on preclinical and clinical materials when the materials have passed all quality testing required for collaborator acceptance and title and risk of loss have transferred to the collaborator 
we may also produce research material for potential collaborators under material transfer agreements 
additionally  we perform research activities  including developing antibody specific conjugation processes  on behalf of our collaborators and potential collaborators during the early evaluation and preclinical testing stages of drug development 
generally  we are reimbursed for certain of our direct and overhead costs of producing these materials or providing these services 
we record the amounts received for the preclinical materials produced or services performed as a component of research and development support revenue 
we also develop conjugation processes for materials for 
table of contents later stage testing and commercialization for certain collaborators 
we are reimbursed for certain of our direct and overhead costs and may receive milestone payments for developing these processes which are recorded as a component of research and development support revenue 
our license agreements have milestone fees which generally meet the criteria of asu no 
revenue recognition milestone method  and accordingly  revenue is recognized when such milestones are achieved 
broad option agreements the accounting for broad option agreements is dependent on the nature of the option granted to the collaborative partner 
for broad option agreements where the option to secure a development and commercialization license to our tap technology is considered substantive  we defer upfront payments received from these agreements and recognize this revenue over the period during which the collaborator could elect to take an option for a development and commercialization license 
these periods are specific to each collaboration agreement 
if a collaborator takes an option to acquire a development and commercialization license under these agreements  any substantive option fee is deferred and recognized over the life of the option  generally to months 
if a collaborator exercises an option and we grant a single target development and commercialization license to the collaborator  we account for any license fee as we would an upfront payment on a single target license  as discussed above 
upon exercise of an option to acquire a development and commercialization license  we would recognize any remaining deferred option fee or exercise fee as we would an upfront payment on a single target license as discussed above 
in the event a broad option research agreement were to be terminated  we would recognize as revenue any portion of the upfront fee that had not previously been recorded as revenue  but was classified as deferred revenue  at the date of such termination 
we recognize revenue related to research activities as they are performed  as long as there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the related receivable is probable 
for broad option agreements where the option to secure a development and commercialization license to our tap technology is not considered substantive  we account for any fees received as we would an upfront payment on a single target license  as discussed above 
we do not directly control when any collaborator will exercise its options for development and commercialization licenses 
as a result  we cannot predict when we will recognize revenues in connection with any of the foregoing 
non exclusive license we received up front payments related to the non exclusive license of our humanization technology and have deferred these payments  and are recognizing the revenue over the term of the agreement 
inventory we review our estimates of the net realizable value of our inventory at each reporting period 
our estimate of the net realizable value of our inventory is subject to judgment and estimation 
the actual net realizable value of our inventory could vary significantly from our estimates 
we consider quantities of raw materials in excess of twelve month projected usage that are not supported by firm  fixed collaborator orders and projections at the time of the assessment to be excess 
during fiscal years and  we obtained additional quantities of dmx from our supplier which amounted to more material than would be required by our collaborators over the next twelve months and as a result  we recorded million and  respectively  of charges to research and development expense related to raw material inventory identified as excess 
we also recorded  to write down certain raw material inventory to its net realizable value  which is also included in research and development 
table of contents expense for the year ended june  no similar costs were recorded during the year ended june  our collaborators estimates of their clinical material requirements are based upon expectations of their clinical trials  including the timing  size  dosing schedule and the maximum tolerated dose likely to be reached for the compound being evaluated 
our collaborators actual requirements for clinical materials may vary significantly from their projections 
significant differences between our collaborators actual manufacturing orders and their projections could result in our actual twelve month usage of raw materials varying significantly from our estimated usage at an earlier reporting period 
reductions in collaborators projections could indicate that we have additional excess raw material inventory and we would then evaluate the need to record further write downs  which would be included as charges to research and development expense 
stock based compensation as of june   the company is authorized to grant future awards under one share based compensation plan  which is the immunogen  inc employee  director and consultant equity incentive plan 
the stock based awards are accounted for under asc topic  compensation stock compensation  pursuant to which the estimated grant date fair value of awards is charged to the statement of operations over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
such amounts have been reduced by our estimate of forfeitures for unvested awards 
the fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
expected volatility is based exclusively on historical volatility data of our stock 
the expected term of stock options granted is based exclusively on historical data and represents the period of time that stock options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the expected term is calculated for and applied to one group of stock options as we do not expect substantially different exercise or post vesting termination behavior amongst our employee population 
the risk free rate of the stock options is based on the us treasury rate in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the stock options 
estimated forfeitures are based on historical data as well as current trends 
stock compensation cost incurred during the years ended june   and was million  million and million  respectively 
during fiscal year  we recorded approximately  of stock compensation cost related to the modification of certain outstanding common stock options in accordance with our former chief executive officer succession plan 
results of operations revenues our total revenues for the year ended june  were million compared with million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the million increase in revenues in fiscal year from fiscal year is attributable to higher revenues from research and development support  license and milestone fees and clinical materials reimbursement  as discussed below 
the million decrease in revenues in fiscal year from fiscal year is attributable to all revenue categories  as discussed below 

table of contents research and development support was million for the year ended june   million for the year ended june   and million for the year ended june  these amounts primarily represent research funding earned based on actual resources utilized under our agreements with our collaborators as shown in the table below 
also included in research and development support revenue are fees for developing antibody specific conjugation processes on behalf of our collaborators and potential collaborators during the early evaluation and preclinical testing stages of drug development 
the amount of research and development support revenue we earn is directly related to the number of our collaborators and potential collaborators  the stage of development of our collaborators product candidates and the resources our collaborators allocate to the development effort 
as such  the amount of development fees may vary widely from quarter to quarter and year to year 
total revenue recognized from research and development support from each of our collaborative partners in the years ended june   and is included in the following table in thousands year ended june  research and development support collaborative partner amgen bayer healthcare biogen idec biotest roche novartis sanofi other total revenue from license and milestone fees for the year ended june  increased approximately  to million from million in the year ended june  revenue from license and milestone fees for the year ended june  was million 
included in license and milestone fees for the year ended june  were a million milestone payment related to the initiation of phase i clinical testing of sar by sanofi and a million milestone payment related to the ind filing of bay by bayer healthcare 
included in license and milestone fees for the year ended june  were million and  of preclinical milestones earned pursuant to our agreements with bayer healthcare and sanofi  respectively  as well as a million milestone related to the initiation of phase i clinical testing of sar by sanofi 
included in license and milestone fees for the year ended june  was a million milestone related to the initiation of phase iii clinical testing of trastuzumab emtansine  or t dm  by roche  a million milestone related to the initiation of phase ii clinical testing of ave by sanofi and a  milestone related to the initiation of phase i clinical testing of bt by biotest 
also during the year ended june   millennium pharmaceuticals and boehringer ingelheim agreed to terminate their licenses with us that were no longer being used to develop products and as a result  we recognized as license and milestone fees  and  respectively  of upfront fees previously deferred 
the amount of license and milestone fees we earn is directly related to the number of our collaborators and potential collaborators  the resources our collaborators allocate to the advancement of the product candidates  the number of clinical trials our collaborators conduct and the speed of enrollment and overall success in those trials 
as such  the amount of license and milestone fees may vary widely from quarter to quarter and year to year 
total revenue recognized from license and milestone fees from each of our 
table of contents collaborative partners in the years ended june   and is included in the following table in thousands year ended june  license and milestone fees collaborative partner amgen bayer healthcare biogen idec biotest boehringer ingelheim janssen biotech roche millennium sanofi total deferred revenue of million at june  represents payments received from our collaborators pursuant to our license agreements  including a million upfront payment received from novartis during the current fiscal year  which we have yet to earn pursuant to our revenue recognition policy 
clinical materials reimbursement increased by approximately million to million in the year ended june  compared to million in the year ended june  we earned clinical materials reimbursement of million during the year ended june  during the years ended june   and  we shipped clinical materials in support of a number of our collaborators clinical trials  as well as preclinical materials in support of certain collaborators development efforts and dmx shipments to certain collaborators in support of development and manufacturing efforts 
the increase in clinical materials reimbursement in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is primarily due to greater clinical material shipped in support of one of our collaborator trials due to advancement of the trial  as well as shipments of preclinical and clinical material to a certain collaborator for future  planned clinical testing 
the decrease in clinical materials reimbursement in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is primarily related to less clinical material shipped in support of two of our collaborators trials due to various factors  including the dosage schedule and speed of enrollment within the trials 
we are reimbursed for certain of our direct and overhead costs to produce clinical materials plus  for certain programs  a profit margin 
the amount of clinical materials reimbursement we earn  and the related cost of clinical materials charged to research and development expense  is directly related to the number of clinical trials our collaborators are preparing or have underway  the speed of enrollment in those trials  the dosage schedule of each clinical trial and the time period  if any  during which patients in the trial receive clinical benefit from the clinical materials  and the supply of clinical grade material to our collaborators for process development and analytical purposes 
as such  the amount of clinical materials reimbursement revenue and the related cost of clinical materials charged to research and development expense may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year 
research and development expenses our net research and development expenses relate to i research to evaluate new targets and to develop and evaluate new antibodies  linkers and cytotoxic agents  ii preclinical testing of our own and  in certain instances  our collaborators product candidates  and the cost of our own clinical trials  
table of contents iii development related to clinical and commercial manufacturing processes and iv manufacturing operations 
our research and development efforts have been primarily focused in the following areas activities pursuant to our development and license agreements with various collaborators  activities related to the process  preclinical and clinical development of our internal product candidates  process improvements related to the production of dm  dm and strain development of their precursor  ansamitocin p  development activities with contract manufacturers for the antibody component of our internal product candidates  and dm  dm and their precursor  ansamitocin p  production costs for the supply of antibody for our internal product candidates  production costs for the supply of dmx for our and our partners preclinical and clinical activities  operation and maintenance of our conjugate manufacturing facility  including production of our own and our collaborators clinical materials  process improvements to our tap technology  evaluation of potential antigen targets  evaluation of internally developed and or in licensed product candidates and technologies  and development and evaluation of additional cytotoxic agents and linkers 
research and development expense for the year ended june  increased million to million from million for the year ended june  research and development expense was million for the year ended june  research and development salaries and related expenses increased by million in the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  and increased by million in the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  the average number of our research personnel increased to for the year ended june  compared to for the year ended june  we had an average of for the year ended june  included in salaries and related expenses for the year ended june  is million of stock compensation costs compared to million and million of stock compensation costs for fiscal years and  respectively 
the higher stock compensation costs in fiscal years and are driven by higher stock prices and increases in the number of annual options granted 
clinical trial costs increased million during fiscal year compared to fiscal year and increased million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year due primarily to higher patient enrollment and increased site management costs driven from expanded sites 
additionally  antibody development and supply expense increased million during fiscal year compared to fiscal year and increased  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year due to the advancement of our internal programs and timing of supply requirements 
we are unable to accurately estimate which potential product candidates  if any  will eventually move into our internal preclinical research program 
we are unable to reliably estimate the costs to develop these products as a result of the uncertainties related to discovery research efforts as well as preclinical and clinical testing 
our decision to move a product candidate into the clinical development phase is predicated upon the results of preclinical tests 
we cannot accurately predict which  if any  of the discovery stage product candidates will advance from preclinical testing and move into our internal clinical development program 
the clinical trial and regulatory approval processes for our product candidates that have advanced or that we intend to advance to clinical testing are lengthy  expensive and uncertain in both timing and outcome 
as a result  the pace and timing of the clinical development 
table of contents of our product candidates is highly uncertain and may not ever result in approved products 
completion dates and development costs will vary significantly for each product candidate and are difficult to predict 
a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control  could cause or contribute to the prevention or delay of the successful completion of our clinical trials  or delay or prevent our obtaining necessary regulatory approvals 
the costs to take a product through clinical trials are dependent upon  among other factors  the clinical indications  the timing  size and design of each clinical trial  the number of patients enrolled in each trial  and the speed at which patients are enrolled and treated 
product candidates may be found to be ineffective or to cause unacceptable side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to progress through clinical trials than anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals or may prove impractical to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable cost or with acceptable quality 
the lengthy process of securing fda approvals for new drugs requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals would materially adversely affect our product development efforts and our business overall 
accordingly  we cannot currently estimate  with any degree of certainty  the amount of time or money that we will be required to expend in the future on our product candidates prior to their regulatory approval  if such approval is ever granted 
as a result of these uncertainties surrounding the timing and outcome of our clinical trials  we are currently unable to estimate when  if ever  our product candidates that have advanced into clinical testing will generate revenues and cash flows 
we do not track our research and development costs by project 
since we use our research and development resources across multiple research and development projects  we manage our research and development expenses within each of the categories listed in the following table and described in more detail below in thousands year ended june  research and development expense research preclinical and clinical testing process and product development manufacturing operations total research and development expense research research includes expenses associated with activities to evaluate new targets and to develop and evaluate new antibodies  linkers and cytotoxic agents for our products and in support of our collaborators 
such expenses primarily include personnel  fees to in license certain technology  facilities and lab supplies 
research expenses increased million to million in fiscal year from fiscal year and  to million in fiscal year from fiscal year the increase in fiscal was principally due to an increase in salaries and related expenses and an increase in contract service expense related to research studies conducted during the year 
the increase in fiscal year was principally the result of an increase in stock compensation costs 
preclinical and clinical testing preclinical and clinical testing includes expenses related to preclinical testing of our own and  in certain instances  our collaborators product candidates  regulatory activities  and the cost of our own clinical trials 
such expenses include personnel  patient enrollment at our clinical testing sites  consultant fees  contract services  and facility expenses 
preclinical and clinical testing expenses increased million to million in fiscal year from fiscal and million to million in fiscal year from fiscal year the increase in fiscal year was primarily the result of an increase in clinical trial costs and an increase in salaries and related expenses 
the increase in fiscal year was primarily the result of an increase in clinical trial costs  an increase in consulting fees for regulatory assistance and preclinical studies conducted  and an 
table of contents increase in salaries and related expenses due to the addition of two executive officers and higher salary levels 
process and product development process and product development expenses include costs for development of clinical and commercial manufacturing processes for our own and collaborator compounds 
such expenses include the costs of personnel  contract services and facility expenses 
total development expenses increased million to million in fiscal year from fiscal year and expenses decreased  to million in fiscal year from fiscal year the increase in fiscal year was primarily the result of an increase in salaries and related expenses  as well as an increase in contract service expense due to increased outsourcing of certain release and stability testing of internal antibodies 
manufacturing operations manufacturing operations expense includes costs to manufacture preclinical and clinical materials for our own and our collaborators product candidates  quality control and quality assurance activities and costs to support the operation and maintenance of our conjugate manufacturing facility 
such expenses include personnel  raw materials for our and our collaborators preclinical studies and clinical trials  development costs with contract manufacturing organizations  manufacturing supplies  and facilities expense 
manufacturing operations expense increased million to million in fiscal year from fiscal year and million to million in fiscal year from fiscal year the increase in fiscal year was primarily the result of i an increase in cost of clinical materials reimbursed for clinical materials shipped to partners during the current period and amounts of dmx written off as excess  ii an increase in antibody development and supply expense  iii an increase in raw materials used in production due to increased manufacturing activity  iv an increase in contract service expense  and v an increase in salaries and related expenses 
partially offsetting these increases  overhead utilization absorbed by the manufacture of clinical materials on behalf of our collaborators increased 
the increase in fiscal year was primarily the result of i a decrease in overhead utilization from the manufacture of clinical materials on behalf of our collaborators  ii an increase in antibody supply and development expenses  and iii an increase in stock compensation costs 
partially offsetting these increases  contract service expense decreased and cost of clinical materials reimbursed decreased 
antibody expense in anticipation of potential future clinical trials  as well as our ongoing trials  was million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and  in fiscal year the process of antibody production is lengthy as is the lead time to establish a satisfactory production process at a vendor 
accordingly  costs incurred related to antibody production and development have fluctuated from period to period and we expect these cost fluctuations to continue in the future 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  increased million to million from million for the year ended june  general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  were million

we anticipate that our current capital resources and expected future collaborator payments under existing collaborations will enable us to meet our operational expenses and capital expenditures through fiscal year however  we cannot provide assurance that such collaborative agreement funding will  in fact  be received 
should we or our partners not meet some or all of the terms and conditions of our various collaboration agreements  we may be required to pursue additional strategic partners  secure alternative financing arrangements  and or defer or limit some or all of our research  development and or clinical projects 
contractual obligations below is a table that presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of june  in thousands payments due by period total less than one year years years more than years waltham lease obligation other operating lease obligations total lease agreement was signed on july  in december  we entered into a sublease for  square feet of our office and laboratory space at winter street  waltham  ma through january we will receive approximately million in minimum rental payments over the remaining term of the sublease  which is not included in the table above 
in addition to the above table  we are contractually obligated to make future success based regulatory milestone payments in conjunction with certain collaborative agreements 
these payments are contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events and  given the nature of these events  it is unclear when  if ever  we may be required to pay such amounts 
therefore  the timing of any future payment is not reasonably estimable 
as a result  these contingent payments have not been included in the table above or recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
as of june   the maximum amount that may be payable in the future under such arrangements is approximately million

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration  interest rate risk is mitigated 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item 
our foreign currency hedging program uses forward contracts to manage the foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations 
the contracts are denominated in euros and have maturities of less than one year 
our foreign currency risk management strategy is principally designed to mitigate the future potential financial impact of changes in the value of transactions  anticipated transactions and balances denominated in foreign currency  resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our market risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates are concentrated primarily in a portfolio of short duration foreign currency forward contracts 
generally  these contracts provide that we receive certain foreign currencies and pay us dollars at specified exchange rates at specified future dates 
although we are exposed to credit and market risk in the event of future nonperformance by a counterparty  management has no reason to believe that such an event will occur
