the following discussion includes forward looking statements that involve numerous risks and uncertainties 
actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth under the risk factors  cautionary notice regarding forward looking statements and business sections in this annual report on form k 
we use words such as anticipate  estimate  plan  project  continuing  ongoing  expect  believe  intend  may  will  should  could  and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
overview we produce  process  and sell coal in the people s republic of china china or prc and also have a financial interest in the bowie mine  a us thermal coal mine located in paonia  colorado 
as of april  our vertically integrated coal operations include four coal mines  three coal washing plans  one coking facility  and a coal wholesale and distribution network in the southwest region of china 
as of april  the results of our annual coal operations are as follows coal mining approximately  tons  coal washing approximately  tons  coal whole sale approximately  tons and coking approximately  tons 
currently  substantially all of our coal mining operations are located in the guizhou and yunnan provinces 
our operations are located in inland and rural areas of china  which are being developed at a faster rate than the coastal areas that have historically received most of the prc s government focus 
we sell the coal we produce  or acquire through wholesalers  both though direct sales to end users in china and through other wholesalers 
we were initially founded in by an american citizen and current chairman and ceo dickson lee and originally focused on consulting services 
in we become a public reporting company and in acquired a majority interest in a coal related air compressor equipment company located in china  which interest we disposed on in in order to focus on growing our coal businesses 
in we commenced our coal operations which now constitute our principal operating business 
we have funded our business to date primarily through investments from our founder and chairman  from private placements  from cash flows from operations and from certain debt financings and arrangements 
we conduct our operations through both wholly owned subsidiaries  majority interests in other entities  and one investment in a us based mine 
as of april   we entered into several agreements with colorado based bowie resources  llc bowie and have loaned a total of about million to bowie 
the loan originally carried an interest rate of nine percent which has since increased to eleven percent 
the total owing to the company as of april   bowie owed us was  under such agreement 
in addition to the loan  the company has secured exclusive rights to market coal from bowie to china  taiwan  japan  and korea details of operation are still being finalized 
bowie has been mining coal since and recently resumed its longwall production 
it produces high quality super compliance thermal coal with high btu  low sulfur  and low ash 
the company is also exploring ports for both import and export  including zhangjiang port in guangdong province  china  and expects to begin shipping in the fall of this year 
we are a united states company incorporated in nevada and headquartered in seattle  wa and have a china operations center is kunming city in yunnan province 
the majority of our management team and board of directors are american citizens  including three of our officers  and many are bilingual 
after being a public reporting company since  we commenced trading on the nasdaq global market in february there are several relevant macro economic factors directly impacting our operating environment in china including gdp growth and inflation 
according to the world bank  china s gdp growth is projected to expand percent in  which is slower than last year s growth of percent 
coupled with projected inflation of percent  the prc has tightened their fiscal policies including letting interest rates rise and capping prices of certain domestically produced commodities like coal not to exceed last year s prices 
the result has been higher demand for coal to fuel gdp growth but coal shortages due to the capping of coal prices 
these coal shortages have been exacerbated by floods in australia and inclement weather in indonesia  both temporarily decreasing coal production in countries that export coal to china 
coal will continue to be a key component of the prc s energy policy 
according to the us energy information administration  coal makes up of china s total primary energy consumption and china is both the largest consumer and producer of coal in the world 
in  china accounted for over of the world s coal consumption 
it is estimated that demand for coal in china will continue to increase for several decades  thus producing a favorable business environment for coal producers and wholesalers 
although china has substantial natural coal resources  the coal mining industry in china is fragmented and inefficient  and includes many small companies who lack the economies of scale and resources needed to maximize production capacity 
historically  mining companies in china have been unable to produce enough coal to meet china s growing coal demands  and as a result the prc has allowed china to become a net importer of coal and has implemented a national policy of consolidation to increase production capacity and improve efficiency and safety at coal mines in china 
beginning with the th year plan  the policy of government mandated consolidation has continued with the current th year plan  which expands and accelerates the consolidation to new provinces including guizhou 
on april   the general office of the government of guizhou province issued document number notifying the guizhou province energy department of guidelines related to accelerating the pace of consolidation through there are three main components to the guidelines production  safety  and efficiency 
first  in addition to increasing individual mine production  the provincial government is mandating that individual mines be consolidated into coal holding companies responsible for a minimum production between  and  tons per year  thus reducing the number of coal holding companies to or less 
second  safety standards will continue to rise as well as increased safety enforcement activity 
for example  a mine accident in a county will now result in a temporary shutdown of all mines operating in that county so that safety inspectors can review the safety of each mine 
third  to improve efficiency  the level of mechanization will increase significantly  both in shaft drilling and coal production 
soon after the distribution of guizhou province s policy  liupanshui city government  which is the local government of pan county where our ping yi and daping mines operate  issued their implementation policy 
we also anticipate and are prepared for the consolidation policy to eventually be implemented and accelerated in yunnan province 
as a result of increasing individual mine production standards and the accelerating consolidation policy  our coal operations have grown significantly in the last five years  primarily through acquisitions  and more recently from expanding production capacity at existing mines 
in we acquired a coal consolidator and wholesaler  kmc wholesale and distribution  with over ten years experience in coal operations 
in  we acquired an interest in l l coal partners  which owns and operates two operating coal mines  the dapuan mine and sutsong mine 
in may  l l coal partners completed the construction of a coal washing plant located at the dapuan mining facility 
in january  we acquired our third coal mine  the ping yi mine  and in june completed the construction of a coal washing plant located near our ping yi mine 
in february  we acquired the zonelin coking operation 
in february  we entered into an exclusive agreement to market coal from a us supplier to asia and in march  we acquired a interest in another coal mine  the daping mine 
our seasoned and experienced management team  coupled with advice from our board who have significant expertise in transportation and commerce  auditing and accounting  and mining 
we are integrating and expanding our production capacity and improving safety practices and efficiency at the four mines we have acquired to date  all of which are being expanded to meet the  tons a year threshold required by the current consolidation policy 
as we develop interests in usmines we will have further access to state of the art mining technology and safety practices which are critical to successful compliance with the consolidation policy but are not commonly available in china 
we believe that the current consolidation policy in china will continue and thus create more acquisition opportunities for us 
focusing on compliance with ever increasing production  safety  and efficiency standards  we plan to continue to expand our coal business two ways first through expansion of our existing mining  washing  coking  and wholesale and distribution operations  and second through continued acquisitions of existing coal operations leveraging the already in place guizhou coal consolidation order 
our business plan calls for acquiring existing mines with good infrastructure and sufficient reserves but lack the capital and management expertise to expand beyond the minimum  tons a year minimum production requirements being mandated by china s accelerated coal consolidation policies 
we will need to raise additional capital to expand our operations  both to fund additional investments in capital equipment and technology to increase production and improve safety at existing facilities and to acquire additional operations 
discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management evaluates its estimates on an on going basis 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from the estimates used 
our actual results have generally not differed materially from our estimates 
however  we monitor such differences and  in the event that actual results are significantly different from those estimated  we disclose any related impact on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
note 
to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k provides a description of our significant accounting policies 
we believe that of these significant accounting policies  the following involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity use of estimates the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base these estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results may differ from management s estimates 
estimate of recoverable coal reserves 
the company capitalizes its mineral rights at fair value when acquired  including amounts associated with any value beyond proven and probable reserves  and amortized to operations as depletion expense using the units of production method over the estimated recoverable coal 
estimate impairment of long lived assets the company applies the provisions of asc topic  property  plant  and equipment  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company evaluates the recoverability of its long lived assets if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
this analysis is performed by comparing the respective carrying values of the assets to the current and expected future cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  to be generated from such assets 
asc requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amounts 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the long lived assets 
loss on long lived assets to be disposed of is determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced for the cost of disposal 
based on its review  the company believes that as of april  and  there was no impairment of its long lived assets 
estimate impairment intangibles the company applies accounting standards codification asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other intangible assets  to record goodwill and intangible assets 
in accordance with asc  certain intangible assets are to be assessed periodically for impairment using fair value measurement techniques 
goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of the end of the company fiscal year  or more frequently when impairment indicators arise 
the company evaluates the recoverability of intangible assets periodically and takes into account events and circumstances which indicate that impairment exists 
the company believes that as of april  and  there was no impairment of its goodwill 
estimate of the fair value measurements for certain of the company s financial instruments  including cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  other receivable  accounts payable and other payables  the carrying amounts approximate their fair values due to their short maturities 
in addition  the company has long term debt with financial institutions 
the carrying amounts of the line of credit and other long term liabilities approximate their fair values based on current rates of interest for instruments with similar characteristics 
asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the company 
asc  financial instruments  defines fair value  and establishes a three level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures 
the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for receivables  certain other current assets and current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest 
the three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows level inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 
level inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
level inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement 
the company did not identify any other non recurring assets and liabilities that are required to be presented in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value in accordance with asc revenue recognition in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin sab topic  revenue recognition  the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
the company must meet all of the following four criteria under sab to recognize revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the sales price is fixed or determinable collection is reasonably assured payments received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied are recorded as advances from customers 
accounts receivable the company s policy is to maintain reserves for potential credit losses on accounts receivable 
management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves 
as of april  and  the company determined that no reserve for accounts receivable was necessary 
no allowance for doubtful accounts or sales returns deemed necessary 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value  as determined on moving average basis 
foreign currency translation the accounts of the company s chinese subsidiaries are maintained in the rmb and the accounts of the us parent company are maintained in the usd 
the accounts of the chinese subsidiaries were translated into usd in accordance with asc topic  foreign currency matters  with the rmb as the functional currency for the chinese subsidiaries 
according to asc  all assets and liabilities were translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date  stockholders equity is translated at historical rates and statement of income items are translated at the weighted average exchange rate for the period 
the resulting translation adjustments are reported under other comprehensive income in accordance with asc topic  comprehensive income 
gains and losses resulting from the translations of foreign currency transactions and balances are reflected in the statements of income 
asset retirement cost and obligation asset retirement costs are accounted for in accordance with asc topic  asset retirement obligations 
pursuant to asc  the company recognizes the fair value of the liability for an asset retirement obligation  which is recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the fair value of the liability is estimated using projected discounted cash flows 
in subsequent periods  the retirement obligation is accreted to its future value  which is the estimate of the obligation at the asset retirement date 
the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated or depleted over the useful lives of the respective assets 
if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount  a gain or loss would be recognized at such time 
income taxes the company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes  under which deferred taxes are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates expected to be in effect during the years in which the basis differences reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
gaap also requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
as of april   income tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold to be recognized 
a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination  with a tax examination being presumed to occur 
the amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized on examination 
for tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test  no tax benefit is recorded 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
no material deferred tax amounts were recorded at april  and  respectively 
gaap also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures and transition 
the charge for taxation is based on the results for the reporting period as adjusted for items  which are non assessable or disallowed 
it is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date 
the company s operating subsidiaries located in prc are subject to prc income tax 
the new chinese enterprise income tax eit law was effective on january  under the new income tax laws of prc  a company is generally subject to income tax at an effective rate of on income reported in the statutory financial statements after appropriated tax adjustments 
stock based compensation the company records stock based compensation in accordance with asc topic  compensation stock compensation 
asc requires companies to measure compensation cost for stock based employee compensation at fair value at the grant date and recognize the expense over the employee s requisite service period by using the black scholes option pricing model 
under asc  the company s volatility is based on the historical volatility of the company s stock or the expected volatility of similar companies 
the expected life assumption is primarily based on historical exercise patterns and employee post vesting termination behavior 
the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
comparison of the fiscal years ended april  and our operating results during the year ended april  compared to the year ended april  reflect strong growth and  in particular  organic expansion of current operations 
in the year ended april   we invested in and increased the capacity of two of our current mines  dapuan and sutsong each from  tons to  tons  and we finished construction of a  ton dms coal washing facility at ping yi mine site 
during the year ended april   we also acquired a majority interest in daping mine  which added additional capacity of  tons per year 
the results of operations attributable to each of our segments coal mining  wholesale coal  coke  and coal washing is discussed in detail below 
coal mining segment the following table is a summary of important year to year operating data for our coal mining segment year ended april  increase decrease coal mining revenue tons sold average price per ton sold coal mining cost of goods sold average coal mining cost of goods sold per ton coal mining selling  general and administrative expense average coal mining selling  general and administrative expense per ton coal mining operating income expense average coal mining operating income per ton coal mining revenue total coal mining revenue increased during the year ended april  compared to the year ended april   primarily as a result of strong organic growth 
revenue from the daping mine generally did not impact revenue in the year ended april   as the acquisition of such mine was completed late in the year strength in our organic coal sales in the year ended april  is chiefly attributable to our investment in mechanization and mine infrastructure  both of which allow us to increase the productivity of our mines 
we also continued to benefit from growth in china s economy and the resultant demand for energy 
in particular  the china central government western development program  a government mandate for additional energy to fuel economic growth  creates significant demand for coal and coal related products in our markets 
average price per ton during the year ended april  remained steady  compared to the year ended april   primarily due to a price freeze implemented by the government 
the company is vertically integrated and was able to manage price volatility in the year ended april   to a certain extent  by selling some production from ping yi coal mine to ping yi coal washing plant the net effect of which is eliminated via inter company sales in our financial statements 
ping yi mine accounted for of the company s total production volume in the year ended april  our coal mining sales in the fourth quarter of the year ended april  decreased relative to the rest of the year  partly due to normal seasonal adjustment coal prices typically fall as the weather gets warmer  and partly due to government mandated shut downs at several of our mines 
we are occasionally obligated to shut down our mines  through no fault of our own  when other mines in our regions experience accidents or safety violations 
there were fatal mining accidents in yunnan province and fatal accidents in pan county of guizhou province during the fourth quarter of the year ended april   and these events prompted several shut downs at our facilities 
none of these accidents or fatalities happened in l l properties coal mining cost of sales total coal mining cost of goods sold increased during the year ended april  compared to the year ended april  and during the year ended april  relative to revenues for the same period 
the relative increase in coal mining cost of sales was primarily due to an increase in the cost of both direct labor wages and direct materials inflation in price of raw materials 
to a lesser extent  we experienced an increase in the direct cost of extraction due to increased direct safety and the maintenance costs in our mining operations 
lastly  the depreciation related to our investments in infrastructure  allocated as a direct expense  increased during the period 
coal mining sg a total coal mining selling  general  and administrative expense increased by approximately million during the year ended april   but was approximately unchanged relative to revenues 
our increase in real dollar fixed cost was related to hiring additional personnel associated with sales  maintenance  safety  and training

wholesale cost of sales wholesale cost of sales increased during the year ended april  compared to the year ended april  this increase was primarily a result of a doubling of tons sold 
wholesale cost of goods sold increased relative to sales due to inflation in the cost of fine coal 
wholesale sg a wholesale sg a increased during the year ended april  compared to the year ended april  this increase was primarily a result of an large increase in sales

coal washing cost of sales coal washing cost of sales increased approximately in the year ended april  compared to the year ended april  this was primarily attributable to the increased capacity added to our ping yi facility 
we were also able to benefit from a slight decrease in our washing cost inputs during the year ended april   including buying coal more cheaply and efficiently  while managing to increase its selling prices 
the average selling price of coal increased over while average direct costs per ton slightly increased about 
the effect was that gross profits increased about per ton during the year 
coal washing sg a coal washing sg a increased approximately million in the year ended april  compared to the year ended april  this was primarily due to our investment in the ping yi facility mentioned above 
depreciation related to the facility increased markedly during the year ended april  because the facility transferred from in process construction status to a fixed asset 
as part of the ramp up to full production capacity  the company also added administrative and safety staff and bought maintenance  safety  and training equipment that  in total  equated to a per ton additional expense

our revenues increased  relative to the prior period  both due to acquisitions and expansion of current operations 
we increased the capacity of dapuan and sutsong mines each to  tons during the year ended april   and we acquired ping yi mine during the third quarter of the fiscal year 
coal mining cost of sales total coal mining cost of goods sold decreased relative to sales 
the positive margin movement was primarily a result of decreased extraction costs  including both labor and direct materials  related to efficiencies and economies of scale in our mines 
coal mining sg a total coal mining selling  general  and administrative expense increased by approximately million during the year ended april   but was down relative to revenues due to operating leverage in our fixed expenses 
our increase in real dollar fixed cost was related to startup costs and hiring personnel associated with sales  maintenance  safety  and training

we acquired a large  new customer in the first quarter of fiscal year who significantly affected revenues and who accounted for of total wholesale revenues for the year 
wholesale cost of sales wholesale cost of goods sold decreased by relative to sales during the year ended april  due to the lowered cost of inputs  particularly fine coal 
wholesale sg a wholesale sg a decreased approximately  or  relative to sales due to lowered warehouse rental and staffing costs

coal washing cost of sales coal washing cogs were of sales during the startup year of operations 
coal washing sg a coal washing sg a reflected startup costs  new administrative and safety staff  and the acquisition of maintenance  safety  and training equipment equating to about per ton expense 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of cash include cash on hand  cash from sales of coal production to our customers  borrowings under credit facilities  proceeds from financing transactions  and occasional sales of non core assets 
we believe the principal indicator of our liquidity is our cash position 
as of april   our cash and cash equivalents was our primary uses of cash include our cash costs of coal production  capital expenditures and related construction in progress  installment payments related to acquisitions  debt service costs interest and principal  and lease obligations in regards to office space and related equipment 
our principal liquidity requirement is working capital to finance our coal production 
we generally fund both our operations and our capital expenditure requirements with cash generated from operations 
cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended april   compared to  from the same period in this decrease is attributable to periodical provincial safety closures in our mines 
for the year ended april   net cash used in investing activities was  compared to  for the year ended april  this decrease was mainly attributable to the company executing fewer acquisitions of new assets in fy compared to fy net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended april   compared to  from the same period in this was a result of a decrease in issuance of common stock 
net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended april   compared to  from the same period in this increase is attributable to cash improvements incurred due to an increase in net income  which was mainly due to the acquisition of hong xing and zone lin 
for the year ended april   net cash used in investing activities was  compared to  for the year ended april  this increase was mainly due to an increase in construction in progress and the purchase of additional property plant and equipment in line with our organic growth plans of acquisitions 
net cash provided by financing activities was  for the year ended april  compared to  during the same period in this was a result of increase in issuance of common stock 
capital expenditures our business is capital intensive and requires substantial capital expenditures for  among other things  developing our mines and purchasing and upgrading equipment 
we also make investments to improve the productivity of our operations and comply with local license and safety regulations 
we have historically funded  and expect to continue to fund  capital expenditures predominantly with cash from operations 
capital expenditures were approximately million for the year ended april  we expect our total capital expenditures will be approximately million for equipment and infrastructure  based on our existing coal operations  for the year ending april  working capital during the year ended april  our accounts receivable increased million  a net use of cash 
the increase in ar balance is primarily attributable to ar increases in both our kmc and tni s subsidiaries 
during the year ended april   our accounts payable increased by million  a net source of cash 
our accounts payable increased during the last fiscal year due to purchase of materials  supplies  and services needed to increase our production capacity 
during the year ended april  our inventories decreased by million in  a net source of cash 
we carried lower inventories partly due to increased through put from our ping yi washing facility 
during fy other payables increased from million to million primarily due to payments outstanding for the acquisition of daping 
construction in progress construction in progress represents the company s in progress  not yet capitalized  investment in infrastructure 
construction in progress for the year ended april  includes mine development  ventilation and electrical system improvements  building of staff quarters  beginning construction of a sewage treatment system  and road expansion 
construction in progress totaled million as of april  management presently believes that cash flow from operations and increasing access to credit will provide the company sufficient capital resources for the infrastructure  mechanization  and safety elements of its business strategy 
to implement its acquisition strategy  in conjunction with the government mandated consolidation of mines  the company may consider the issuance of additional debt or equity securities 
in addition to potential externally raised funds  the company intends to utilize a combination of existing cash on hand  cash flow from operations  and seller paper to finance the acquisition of mines 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements for the fiscal year ended april   and contractual obligations as of april  we were contractually obligated  per our purchase agreements  to inject capital as follows total less than year years years after years dapuan sutsong mines l l yunnan tianneng industry daping coal mine tai fung total during the third quarter of  as part of the acquisitions of tni and pyc  the company assumed two loan agreements with banks in china 
the first loan  related to tni  was for rmb  or approximately  this loan carried an interest rate of per annum and matured on december  and has been paid in full 
the second loan  related to pyc  is for rmb  or approximately  the loan carries an interest rate of per annum and matures february  during the fourth quarter of  as part of the acquisition of daping mine  the company assumed a rmb million bank loan or approximately  with an interest rate of per annum that matures on october  insurance we operate coal mines and related facilities that are inherently dangerous 
we  like other similar companies  have experienced accidents that have caused property damage and personal injuries 
although we have implemented safety measures such as fire training and job specific safety training  and we continuously review our existing operational standards  there can be no assurance that natural disasters and industry related accidents will not occur in the future 
the insurance industry in china is in a developmental stage  and chinese insurance companies offer only limited business insurance products

these laws and regulations impose fees for the discharge of waste substances and pollutants  require the establishment of reserves for reclamation and rehabilitation  impose fines for serious environmental offenses  and authorize the prc government  at its discretion  to close or suspend any facility that it determines has failed to comply with environmental regulations 
the prc government has tightened enforcement of applicable laws and regulations and adopted more stringent environmental and operational standards 
while we believe that our coal mining  washing  and coking operations currently comply in all material respects with existing chinese environmental standards  future environmental related issues could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the results of our operations
