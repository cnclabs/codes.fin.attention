vs 
pacific mercantile bank  filed in may in the california superior court for the county of orange case no 

as previously reported  this lawsuit was initially filed as an individual action by two plaintiffs for alleged violations by the bank of the federal truth in lending act the tila 
the two plaintiffs subsequently amended their complaint on three occasions  between november and may  seeking to convert their individual action into a class action suit and adding additional allegations and seeking rescission of all loans made to the members of the class and damages based on allegations of fraud in the inducement of certain loans  unfair business practices and violations of tila 
in each case  the bank filed demurrers asserting that the plaintiffs had failed to establish a legal basis for any recovery and in each case the trial court sustained the bank s demurrers and dismissed the plaintiffs lawsuit  without prejudice 
plaintiffs subsequently appealed the trial court s rulings 
in january  the appellate court  in a published decision  affirmed the trial court s order dismissing the plaintiffs suit  finding that plaintiffs had no right to assert class wide claims of rescission 
plaintiffs then appealed this decision to the us supreme court which  in may  denied plaintiffs petition for review  effectively sustaining the appellate court s ruling 
plaintiffs  abandoning their claims of fraud and unfair business practices on the part of the bank  then filed a motion with the trial court for class certification limited to the tila and certain related statutory claims 
in january the trial court denied the motion for class certification  finding that plaintiffs had not shown evidence that there were common questions of law or fact to justify certifying a class and had been unable to introduce any admissible evidence establishing that any statutory violations had occurred during the relevant class period 
however  in april  plaintiffs filed an appeal of the trial court s denial of their motion for class certification on the claims under tila and the related statutory claims 
in april the appellate court issued an order certifying plaintiff s class action with respect to the tila claims and remanded the case back to the trial court for further proceedings 
in november  without any admission of any of plaintiffs allegations or any wrongdoing on its part  the bank entered into an agreement with the plaintiffs providing for settlement of all of the claims that were the subject of the class action suit  subject to the approval of the settlement terms by the trial court 
the trial court granted final approval of the settlement on march  the settlement agreement provides for the bank to establish a settlement fund in the amount of  for payment to the members of the class in full settlement of the class action lawsuit 
the settlement agreement further provides that any individual who was eligible to become a member of the class  but elected not to participate in the class action  had the right to receive a payment from the bank in the same amount received by each of the members of the class  provided that the individual submitted a claim form to the class administrator and the claim was accepted by the bank 
a handful of claims were received  but all were rejected by the bank 
no claimant filed an appeal with the court  so the final settlement amount approved by the court remains at  the settlement agreement expressly provided for a complete release of all claims against the bank arising out of the subject matter of the class action suit  except for certain individual claims of the named plaintiffs which were pending in a separate trial proceeding 
the settlement also permitted plaintiffs to apply for an award of attorneys fees and costs 
plaintiffs filed such a motion  and on march   the trial court issued an order requiring the bank to pay fees and costs in the aggregate amount of  notice of this ruling was issued on march   and the bank has a period of days from that date to file an appeal of the trial court s ruling  but has not yet decided whether to do so 
in march  the named plaintiffs agreed to a stipulated settlement of and a complete release of their individual claims against the bank in exchange for the payment to them of an aggregate of  we had previously established reserves in case of an adverse result in the class action suit and  therefore  the settlement payment and attorneys fee award are not expected to materially affect our future operating results or our cash or capital resources 
other legal actions 
we are subject to legal actions that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business 
currently there are no such pending legal proceedings that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

shareholder returns shown in the performance graph are not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance 
dividend policy and share repurchase programs our board of directors has followed the policy of retaining earnings to maintain capital and  thereby  support the growth of the company s banking franchise 
on occasion  the board also considered paying cash dividends out of cash generated in excess of those capital requirements and  in february  the board of directors declared a cash dividend  in the amount of per share of common stock  that was paid on march  the board also authorized share repurchase programs in june and in october  when the board concluded that  at the then prevailing market prices  the company s shares represented an attractive investment opportunity and  therefore  that share repurchases would be a good use of company funds 
in the first quarter of  the board of directors decided that the prudent course of action  in light of the economic recession  was to preserve cash and earnings to enhance the bank s capital position and to be in a position to take advantage of improved economic and market conditions in the future 
in addition  in august  both the bank and the company entered into a written agreement with the federal reserve bank of san francisco  their primary federal banking regulator the frb and the california department of financial institutions  the bank s state banking regulator the dfi 
the written agreement prohibits the payment of cash dividends and share repurchases without the approval of the frb and the dfi 
see item business supervision and regulation pacific mercantile bancorp regulatory action taken by the frb and the dfi 
accordingly  we do not expect to pay dividends or make share purchases at least for the foreseeable future 

table of contents restrictions on the payment of dividends cash dividends from the bank represent the principal source of funds available to the bancorp  which it might use to pay dividends or for other corporate purposes  such as expansion of its business 
therefore  government regulations  including the laws of the state of california  as they pertain to the payment of cash dividends by california state chartered banks  limit the amount of funds that the bank would be permitted to dividend to the bancorp 
as a result  those laws also affect the ability of the bancorp to pay cash dividends to our shareholders or fund other expenditures by the bancorp in the future 
in particular  under california law  cash dividends by a california state chartered bank may not exceed  in any calendar year  the lesser of i the sum of its net income for the year and its retained net income from the preceding two years after deducting all dividends paid during the period  or ii the amount of its retained earnings 
additionally  because the payment of cash dividends has the effect of reducing capital  the capital requirements imposed on bank holding companies and commercial banks often operate  as a practical matter  to preclude the payment  or limit the amount of  cash dividends that might otherwise be permitted by california law  and the federal bank regulatory agencies  as part of their supervisory powers  generally require insured banks to adopt dividend policies which limit the payment of cash dividends much more strictly than do applicable state laws 
as previously discussed above  we are prohibited from paying cash dividends to shareholders without the prior approval of the frb and the dfi and  accordingly  we do not expect to pay cash dividends for at least the foreseeable future 
restrictions on inter company transactions section a of the federal reserve act limits the amounts that a bank may loan to its bank holding company to an aggregate of no more than of the bank subsidiary s capital surplus and retained earnings and requires that such loans be secured by specified assets of the bank holding company see business supervision and regulation restrictions on transactions between the bank and the company and its other affiliates

due to those uncertainties and risks  with respect to the duration and effects of those operating trends and future events on our business  our future financial performance may differ  possibly significantly  from the performance that is currently expected as set forth in the forward looking statements

background the following discussion presents information about our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item of this report 
our principal operating subsidiary is pacific mercantile bank the bank  which is a california state chartered bank and a member of the federal reserve system 
the bank accounts for substantially all of our consolidated revenues and income and assets and liabilities 
accordingly  the following discussion focuses primarily on the bank s operations and financial condition 
overview of fiscal operating results the following table sets forth information comparing our results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  to our results of operations in the years ended december  and year ended december  amount percent change from amount percent change from amount dollars in thousands  except per share data interest income interest expense net interest income provision for loan losses net interest income expense after provision for loan losses noninterest income noninterest expense income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net loss per share data diluted net loss per share diluted weighted average number of diluted shares 
table of contents as the above table indicates  during the year ended december   we made substantial improvements in our operating results  in  including increase in net interest income 
net interest income increased by to million from million in as compared to reductions in provisions made for loan losses 
we were able to reduce the provision we made for loan losses to million  a decrease of million  or  in from million in  due primarily to declines in net loan charge offs and in loan delinquencies and an increase in recoveries of previously charged off loans 
notwithstanding that reduction in the provision for loan losses in  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans outstanding at december  was  unchanged from the ratio at december  increase in noninterest income 
noninterest income increased in by million  or  to million from million in  as our mortgage banking revenue increased to million  or  in from  in as a result of a substantial increase in the volume of mortgage loans originated and sold in the secondary market 
that increase of mortgage banking revenues was partially offset  however  primarily by decreases in deposit and other fee income and in gains on sales of securities in as compared to increase in noninterest expense 
although noninterest expense increased by million  or  in  as compared to  that increase i was largely due to a increase in fdic insurance premiums and increases in expenses incurred in connection with foreclosed real estate and our the collection and foreclosure of non performing loans  and ii was partially offset by reductions totaling approximately  in compensation expense  occupancy costs and data process expenses 
as a result  the million  or  increase in noninterest expense in over  represents a significant improvement over the million  or  increase in such expenses in as compared to in addition  due primarily to the increases in interest income and noninterest income  and the slowing in the growth of noninterest expense in  our efficiency ratio improved to in from in decrease in pre tax loss 
due primarily to the increase in net interest income  the reduction in the provisions made for loan losses  and the increase in noninterest income  we reduced our pre tax loss in by million  or  to million in  from a pre tax loss of million in increase in taxes 
in we recorded income tax expense of million as compared to an income tax benefit of million in the income tax expense recorded in was attributable to a charge recognized  in the third quarter of  to substantially reduce the amount of the deferred tax asset  comprised primarily of tax credit and tax loss carryforwards that we had previously anticipated would be available to reduce our income tax expense in later years 
see critical accounting policies deferred tax asset below in this item of this report 
decline in net loss 
as the table indicates  in we incurred a net loss of million  or per diluted share 
however  million of that net loss was attributable to the increase in the provision for income taxes and  even with that increase in income tax expense  our net loss in was million  or  lower than the net loss we incurred in although we are disappointed by our bottom line results in  we are encouraged by the increase achieved in our revenues in and  if economic conditions improve even modestly  we believe we can achieve a return to profitability in

changes in financial condition in reduction in real estate construction lending 
to reduce our exposure to the deteriorating conditions in the real estate markets  we began reducing the volume of real estate construction loans in the fourth quarter of  while increasing the volume of commercial and business loans that we are making 
as a result  in late we ceased making real estate construction loans and  as of december   such loans had declined to million  or  of the loans in our loan portfolio from million  or  at december  sale of convertible preferred stock and capital ratios 
although we incurred a net loss of million in  the effect of that loss on our shareholders and tangible book value per share was partially offset by million of equity capital that we raised during the first half of from the sale  in a private placement to a limited number of sophisticated investors  of series a convertible cumulative preferred stock the series a shares 
those shares are convertible into common stock at a conversion price of per share 
moreover  although shareholders equity declined by million to million at december   from million at december   the ratio of our consolidated total capital to risk weighted assets  which is the principal federal regulatory measure of the financial strength of banking institutions  was 
as a result  we continued to be classified  under bank regulatory guidelines  as a well capitalized banking institution  which is the highest of the capital standards established under federal banking regulations 
see capital resources below in this item critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap and accounting practices in the banking industry 
certain of those accounting policies are considered critical accounting policies  because they require us to make estimates and assumptions regarding circumstances or trends that could materially affect the value of those assets  such as economic conditions or trends that could impact our ability to fully collect our loans or ultimately realize the carrying value of certain of our other assets 
those estimates and assumptions are made based on current information available to us regarding those economic conditions or trends or other circumstances 
if changes were to occur in the events  trends or other circumstances on which our estimates or assumptions were based  or other unanticipated events were to occur that might affect our operations  we may be required under gaap to adjust our earlier estimates and to reduce the carrying values of the affected assets on our balance sheet  generally by means of charges against income 
our critical accounting policies relate to the determinations of our allowance for loan losses  the fair values of securities available for sale and with respect to the realizability  and hence the valuation  of our deferred tax asset 
allowance for loan losses 
like virtually all banks and other financial institutions  we follow the practice of maintaining an allowance to provide for possible loan losses that occur from time to time as an incidental part of the banking business 
the accounting policies and practices we follow in determining the sufficiency of that allowance require us to make judgments and assumptions about economic and market conditions and trends that can affect the ability of our borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations to us 
in making those judgments  we use historical loss factors  adjusted for current economic and market conditions  other economic indicators and applicable bank regulatory guidelines  to determine losses inherent in our loan portfolio and the sufficiency of our allowance for loan losses 
if unanticipated changes were to occur in those conditions or trends  or the financial condition of borrowers was to deteriorate  actual loan losses could be greater than those that had previously been predicted 
in such events  or if there 
table of contents were changes to the loss factors or regulatory guidelines on which we had based our determinations regarding the sufficiency of the allowance  it could become necessary for us to increase the allowance for loan losses by means of a charge to income referred to in our financial statements as the provision for loan losses 
such an increase would reduce the carrying value of the loans on our balance sheet  and the additional provision for loan losses taken to increase that allowance would reduce our income in the period when it is determined that an increase in the allowance for loan losses is necessary 
during the fourth quarter of  federal bank regulatory agencies adopted new and more stringent guidelines and methodologies for identifying losses in bank loan portfolios and determining the sufficiency of loan loss reserves  as a result of the worsening of the economic recession and the prospects that conditions would not soon improve 
we have been applying those new guidelines and methodologies since the fourth quarter of see the discussion in the subsections entitled provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses and nonperforming loans below 
fair value of securities available for sale 
under applicable accounting principles  we are required to recognize any unrealized loss on the securities we hold for sale 
such an unrealized loss occurs when the fair value of a security held for sale declines below the amortized cost of the security as recorded on our balance sheet 
as a result  we make determinations  on a quarterly basis  of the fair values of such securities in order to determine if there are any unrealized losses in our portfolio of the securities we hold for sale 
when there is an active market for a security  the determination of its fair value is based on market prices 
in the case of securities for which there is not an active trading market  but which do trade from time to time  we rely primarily on quotes we obtain from third party vendors and securities brokers to determine the fair values of those securities 
however  quotes are not always available for some securities and  in order to make determinations of fair value in those instances  it becomes necessary for us to make determinations of fair value based primarily on a variety of industry standard pricing methodologies such as discounted cash flow analyses  matrix pricing  and option adjusted spread models  as well as fundamental analysis of the creditworthiness of the obligors under those securities 
these methodologies require us to make various assumptions relating to such matters as future prepayment speeds  yield  duration  federal reserve board monetary policies and demand and supply for the individual securities 
consequently  if changes were to occur in market or other conditions on which those assumptions or judgments were based  it could become necessary for us to reduce the fair values of such securities  which would result in changes to accumulated other comprehensive income loss on our balance sheet 
moreover  if we conclude that reductions in the fair values of any securities are other than temporary  it will be necessary for us to take an impairment loss directly to our statement of operations 
utilization and valuation of deferred income tax benefits 
we record as a deferred tax asset on our balance sheet an amount equal to the tax credit and tax loss carryforwards and tax deductions tax benefits that we believe will be available to us to offset or reduce income taxes in future periods 
under applicable federal and state income tax laws and regulations  such tax benefits will expire if not used within specified periods of time 
accordingly  the ability to fully use our deferred tax asset to reduce income taxes in the future depends on the amount of taxable income that we generate during those time periods 
at least once each year  or more frequently  if warranted  we make estimates of future taxable income that we believe we are likely to generate during those future periods 
if we conclude  on the basis of those estimates and the amount of the tax benefits available to us  that it is more likely than not that we will be able to fully utilize those tax benefits prior to their expiration  we recognize the deferred tax asset in full on our balance sheet 
on the other hand  if we conclude on the basis of those estimates and the amount of the tax benefits available to us that it has become more likely than not that we will be unable to utilize those tax benefits in full prior to their expiration  then  we would establish or increase any existing valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset on our balance sheet to the amount with respect to which we believe it is still more likely  than not  that we will be able to use to offset or reduce taxes in the future 
the establishment or an increase in that valuation allowance is implemented by recognizing a non cash charge that would have the effect of increasing the provision  or reducing any credit  for income taxes that we would otherwise have recorded in our statements of operations 
the determination of whether and the extent to which we will be able to utilize our deferred tax asset involves significant judgments and assumptions that are subject to period to period changes as a result of changes in tax laws  changes in market or economic conditions that could affect our operating results or variances between our actual operating results and our projected operating results  as well as other factors 
we conducted an assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax asset as of june  based on that assessment and due  in part  to continued weakness in the economy and financial markets  we concluded that it had become more likely  than not  that we would be unable to utilize our remaining tax benefits comprising our deferred tax asset prior to their expiration 
therefore  we recorded an additional valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset in the amount of million by means of a non cash charge to income tax expense in the quarter ended june  in the amount of million 
the provision for income taxes we have recorded in our statement of operations for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to that charge 

table of contents results of operations net interest income one of the principal determinants of a bank s income is its net interest income  which is the difference between i the interest that a bank earns on loans  investment securities and other interest earning assets  on the one hand  and ii its interest expense  which consists primarily of the interest it must pay to attract and retain deposits and the interest that it pays on borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities  on the other hand 
a bank s interest income and interest expense are  in turn  affected by a number of factors  some of which are outside of its control  including national and local economic conditions and the monetary policies of the federal reserve board which affect interest rates  the demand for loans by prospective borrowers  the competition among banks and other lending institutions for loans and deposits and the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations 
net interest income  when expressed as a percentage of total average interest earning assets  is a banking organization s net interest margin 
fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  our net interest income increased by million  or  to million  from million in fiscal that increase was primarily attributable to an million  or  decline in interest expense  which more than offset a  or  decrease in interest income in  as compared to the decline in interest expense was due primarily to continuing interest rate reductions implemented by the federal reserve board  in response to the economic recession  which i enabled us to reduce the rates at which we paid interest on time deposits  and ii led to declines in the interest rates charged on our borrowings 
as a result  the average rate of interest that we paid on our interest bearing liabilities in declined to from in also contributing  to a lesser extent  to the decline in interest expense was a million reduction  during  in average borrowings outstanding 
the decline in interest income also was primarily attributable to the federal reserve board s reductions in interest rates  which reduced the yields that we were able to realize on our loans and investments in and more than offset the positive effect on interest income of a modest increase in the volume of loans outstanding during our net interest margin for fiscal increased to  from in fiscal  because of the aforementioned decrease in interest expense  which was a result of i a decrease in the average interest rate paid on time deposits to in from in  and ii a decrease in the average interest rate that we paid on our borrowings to in  from in fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  our net interest income decreased by million  or  to million  from million in fiscal  primarily as a result of a million  or  decrease in interest income which was only partially offset by a million  or  decrease in interest expense 
the decrease in interest income in over was due primarily to a decrease in the average interest rate earned i on loans to in from in  and ii decrease in the yields on short term investments to in from in those decreases were primarily attributable to interest rate reductions implemented by the federal reserve board during  in response to the economic recession and credit crisis 
those reductions caused interest rates on loans and other interest earning assets to remain at historic lows throughout the average interest rate on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities declined to in from in  primarily due to those same interest rate reductions by the federal reserve board  which enabled us to reduce interest rates on deposits and benefit from reductions in interest rates on our borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities 
our net interest margin for fiscal decreased to in from in fiscal  because the decrease in interest income exceeded the decrease in interest expense in due primarily to the effects on our interest expense of i an increase in the volume of our deposits  and ii a change in the mix of our deposits to a higher proportion of time deposits  on which we pay higher rates of interest than on other deposits  and a lower proportion of non interest bearing deposits

table of contents the following table sets forth changes in interest income  including loan fees  and interest paid in each of the years ended december   and and the extent to which those changes were attributable to changes in i the volumes of or in the rates of interest earned on interest earning assets and ii the volumes of or in the rates of interest paid on our interest bearing liabilities

the above table indicates that the million increase in net interest income in was primarily attributable to declines in interest rates on interest bearing liabilities  which were only partially offset by decreases in interest rates on interest earning assets 
that table also indicates that the million decrease in net interest income in was primarily attributable to declines in interest rates on our interest earning assets which more than offset rate related decreases in the interest we paid on interest bearing liabilities 
provision for loan losses like virtually all banks and other financial institutions  we follow the practice of maintaining an allowance to provide for possible loan losses that occur from time to time as an incidental part of the banking business 
when it is determined that the payment in full of a loan has become unlikely  the carrying value of the loan is reduced written down to what management believes is its realizable value or  if it is determined that a loan no longer has any realizable value  the carrying value of the loan is written off in its entirety a loan charge off 
loan charge offs and write downs are charged against that allowance the allowance for loan losses or the all 
the amount of the all is increased periodically i to replenish the all after it has been reduced due to loan write downs and charge offs  ii to reflect increases in the volume of outstanding loans  and iii to take account of changes in the risk of potential loan losses due to a deterioration in the condition of borrowers or in the value of property securing non performing loans or adverse changes in economic conditions 
see financial condition nonperforming loans and the allowance for loan losses below in this item increases in the all are made through a charge  recorded as an expense in the statement of operations  referred to as the provision for loan losses 
recoveries of loans previously charged off are added back to the all and  therefore  have the effect of increasing the all and reducing the amount of the provision that might otherwise have had to be made to replenish or increase the all 
we employ economic models that are based on bank regulatory guidelines  industry standards and our own historical loan loss experience  as well as a number of more subjective qualitative factors  to determine both the sufficiency of the all and the amount of the provisions that need to be made for potential loan losses 
however  those determinations involve judgments about trends in current economic conditions and other events that can affect the ability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations to us and a weighting among the quantitative and qualitative factors we consider in determining the amount of the all 
moreover  the duration and anticipated effects of prevailing 
table of contents economic conditions or trends can be uncertain and can be affected by number of risks and circumstances that are outside of our ability to control 
see the discussion above in item a of this report under the caption risk factors we could incur losses on the loans we make and the discussion below in this item under the caption financial condition nonperforming loans and the allowance for loan losses 
if changes in economic or market conditions or unexpected subsequent events were to occur  or if changes were made to bank regulatory guidelines or industry standards that are used to assess the sufficiency of the all  it could become necessary to incur additional  and possibly significant  charges to increase the allowance for loan losses  which would have the effect of reducing our income or causing us to incur losses 
in addition  the frb and the dfi  as an integral part of their examination processes  periodically review the adequacy of our all 
these agencies may require us to make additional provisions for possible loan losses  over and above the provisions that we have already made  the effect of which would be to reduce our income or increase any losses we might incur 
in  we were able to reduce the provisions that we made for loan losses to million  a decrease of million  or  from the million in provisions made in that decrease was due primarily to declines in net loan charge offs and in loan delinquencies and  to a lesser extent  an increase in recoveries of previously charged off loans 
notwithstanding that reduction in the provision for loan losses in  the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans outstanding at december  was  unchanged from the ratio at december  the million in provisions for loan losses in were made i to provide for increases in non performing loans and net loan write downs and charge offs totaling nearly million that were primarily the result of the economic recession  increases in unemployment  further declines in real property values and a tight credit market  and ii to increase the allowance for loan losses after giving effect to those loan charge offs and write downs  to approximately million at december  from million at december

table of contents compared to the million  or  increase in noninterest expense in was primarily attributable to i a million  or  increase in fdic insurance premiums  due to the imposition by the fdic of substantially higher insurance premiums on all federally insured depository institutions in order to replenish the bank deposit insurance fund which had been depleted by bank failures  ii a  or  increase in expenses incurred in connection with real properties acquired from borrowers on or in lieu of foreclosures typically referred to as other real estate owned  and iii a  or  increase in professional fees  primarily incurred in collecting and foreclosing non performing loans and restructurings loans for those borrowers who demonstrated an ability to meet their loan obligations on extended or modified terms 
those increases were partially offset by a  decrease in salaries and employee benefits resulting from expense reduction initiatives implemented in compared to the increase in noninterest expense in was primarily attributable to i a million increase in professional fees  primarily due to increased legal fees and costs incurred to manage our increased level of non performing loans  which required us to initiate legal proceeding to recover amounts due us by defaulting borrowers  to foreclose real properties and other assets securing non performing loans  and to implement loan restructurings for those borrowers who demonstrated to us an ability to meet their loan obligations on extended or modified terms  ii a million increase in salaries and employee benefits due principally to the addition of mortgage banking personnel and loan administrators  iii a million increase in fdic insurance premiums  due to the imposition by the fdic of substantially higher insurance premiums on all federally insured depository institutions in order to replenish the bank insurance fund which had been depleted by bank failures  and iv a  increase in in expenses incurred in connection with real properties acquired from borrowers on or in lieu of foreclosures 
a measure of our ability to control noninterest expense is our efficiency ratio  which is the ratio of noninterest expense to net revenue net interest income plus noninterest income 
as a general rule  a lower efficiency ratio indicates an ability to generate increased revenue without a commensurate increase in the staffing and equipment and third party services and  therefore  would be indicative of greater operational efficiencies 
in our efficiency ratio improved to from in  due primarily to an increase of million  or in our net interest income in expense reduction initiatives 
in february  we initiated a number of cost cutting measures that were designed to improve the efficiency of our operations and reduce our noninterest expense 
those measures included a work force reduction  a freeze on salaries  elimination of a bonus program for  and suspension of company k plan contributions  which contributed to the decreases in compensation expense  occupancy expense and data processing costs in income tax expense benefit in we recorded a non cash charge of million to income tax expense in order to increase the valuation allowance to million against our net deferred tax asset on our balance sheet 
the increase in the valuation allowance was made as a result of an assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax asset as of june  based on that assessment and due  in part  to continued weakness in the economy and financial markets  we concluded that it had become more likely  than not  that we would be unable to utilize our remaining tax benefits comprising our deferred tax asset prior to their expiration

table of contents securities available for sale 
securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time  but which may be sold in response to changes in liquidity needs  in interest rates  or in prepayment risks or other similar factors  are classified as securities available for sale 
such securities are recorded on our balance sheet at their respective fair values and increases or decreases in those values are recorded as unrealized gains or losses  respectively  and are reported as other comprehensive income loss on our accompanying consolidated balance sheet  rather than included in or deducted from our earnings

we perform a quarterly assessment of the securities that have an unrealized loss to determine whether the decline in fair value of those securities below their cost is other than temporary 
we adopted asc effective april  and  accordingly  we recognize other than temporary impairment for our available for sale debt securities 
in accordance with asc  when there are credit losses associated with an impaired debt security and i we do not have the intent to sell the security and ii it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis  then  we will separate the amount of impairment that is credit related from the amount thereof related to non credit factors 
the credit related impairment is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
the non credit related impairment is recognized and reflected in other comprehensive income 
through the impairment assessment process  we determined that the investments discussed below were other than temporarily impaired otti at december  we recorded impairment credit losses in earnings on available for sale securities of  for the year ended december  the otti related to factors other than credit losses  in the aggregate amount of million  was recognized as other comprehensive loss in our balance sheet

as a part of our otti assessment process with respect to securities held for sale with unrealized losses  we consider available information about i the performance of the collateral underlying each such security  including credit enhancements  ii historical prepayment speeds  iii delinquency and default rates  iv loss severities  v the age or vintage of the security  and iv rating agency reports on the security 
significant judgments are required with respect to these and other factors in order to make a determination of the future cash flows that can be expected to be generated by the security 
based on our otti assessment process  we determined that there were two different investment securities in our portfolio of securities held for sale that had become or were impaired as of december  an asset backed security  and a non agency collateralized mortgage obligation a cmo 
asset backed securities 
at december   we had one asset backed security in our portfolio of investment securities available for sale 
this security is a multi class  cash flow collateralized bond obligation backed by a pool of trust preferred securities issued by a diversified pool of issuers consisting of us depository institutions and insurance companies at the time of the security s issuance in november this security was part of a million issuance 
the security that we own cusip cae is the mezzanine class b piece that floats with month libor basis points and had a rating of aa aa by moody s and fitch at the time of issuance 
we purchased million face value of this security in november at a price of for a total purchase price of  as of december  the book value of this security was million with a fair value of  for an approximate unrealized loss of million 
currently  the security has a ca rating from moody s and cc rating from fitch and has experienced million in defaults of total current collateral and million in payment deferrals of total current collateral from issuance to december  the security did not pay its scheduled fourth quarter interest payment 
the company is not currently accruing interest on this security 
the company estimates that the security could experience another million in defaults before it would not receive all of its contractual cash flows 
this analysis is based on the following assumptions future default rates of  prepayment rates of until maturity  and recovery of future defaults 
we have recognized impairment losses in earnings of   and million for the years ended december   december   and december  non agency cmo 
through our impairment analysis  we identified one non agency collateralized mortgage obligation security a cmo with respect to which we recognized otti at december  this cmo is a super senior support bond  which was originated in  was then rated aaa by standard poor s and aa by moody s  and had a credit support of of the total balance at issuance 
as of december   the security was rated bbb and caa by standard and poor s and moody s  respectively  was determined to have a fair value of  as compared to an amortized cost of  resulting in an unrealized loss of approximately  the cmo is collateralized by a pool of one to four family  fully amortizing residential first mortgage loans that bear interest at a fixed rate for approximately five years  after which they bear interest at variable rates with annual resets 

table of contents at december    credit support underlying this cmo was approximately and delinquencies days and over totaled approximately 
factors considered in determining that this security was impaired included the changes in the ratings of the security  the current level of subordination from other cmo classes  anticipated prepayment rates  cumulative default rates and the loss severity given a default 
based on our impairment assessment and analysis  we recorded an  impairment charge in our statement of operations in in respect of this security  because we concluded that the impairment was attributable to credit factors 
the remaining unrealized loss on this security  of  was recognized as other comprehensive loss on our balance sheet  because we concluded that this loss was attributable to non credit factors  such as external market conditions  the limited liquidity of the security and risks of potential additional declines in the housing market 
impairment losses on otti securities for the twelve months ended december asset backed security non agency cmo we have made a determination that the remainder of our securities with respect to which there were unrealized losses as of december  are not other than temporarily impaired  because we have concluded that we have the ability to continue to hold those securities until their respective fair market values increase above their respective amortized costs or  if necessary  until their respective maturities 
in reaching that conclusion we considered a number of factors and other information  which included i the significance of each such security  ii the amount of the unrealized losses attributable to each such security  iii our liquidity position  iv the impact that retention of those securities could have on our capital position and v our evaluation of the expected future performance of these securities based on the criteria discussed above 
loans held for sale we commenced a new mortgage banking business during the second quarter of to originate  primarily in southern california  residential real estate mortgage loans that qualify for resale into the secondary mortgage markets 
our mortgage originations have been primarily for the financing of purchases of residential property and  to a lesser extent  refinancing of existing residential mortgage loans 
in addition to conventional mortgage loans  we offer loan programs for low to moderate income families that qualify for mortgage assistance  such as the fhlb s wish program  homepath financing on fnma repossessed homes  and southern california home financing authority and various mortgage assistance programs in counties and cities within our branch network

non performing loans consist of i loans on non accrual status because we have ceased accruing interest on those loans  which include loans restructured when there has not been a history of past performance on debt service in accordance with the contractual terms of the restructured loans  and ii loans days or more past due and still accruing interest 
non performing assets consist of non performing loans and oreo  which consists of real properties which have been acquired by foreclosure or similar means and which management intends to offer for sale 
loans are placed on non accrual status when  in the opinion of management  the full timely collection of principal or interest is in doubt 
generally  the accrual of interest is discontinued when principal or interest payments become more than days past due  unless management believes the loan is adequately collateralized and the loan is in the process of collection 
however  in certain instances  we may place a particular loan on non accrual status earlier  depending upon the individual circumstances involved in loan s delinquency 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  previously accrued but unpaid interest is reversed against current income 
subsequent collections of unpaid amounts on such a loan are applied to reduce principal when received  except when the ultimate collectability of principal is probable  in which case interest payments are credited to income 
non accrual loans may be restored to accrual status if and when principal and interest become current and full repayment is expected 
interest income is recognized on the accrual basis for impaired loans not meeting the criteria for non accrual

table of contents allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses the allowance at december  was million  as compared to million at december  as a percentage of total loans outstanding  the allowance at december  was  unchanged from the percentage of the loans outstanding at december  the adequacy of the allowance is determined through periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other factors that can reasonably be expected to affect the ability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations 
those factors are inherently subjective as the process for determining the adequacy of the allowance involves some significant estimates and assumptions about such matters as i the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows of borrowers  ii the fair value of the collateral securing non performing loans  iii estimates of losses that the bank may incur on non performing loans  which are determined on the basis of historical loss experience and industry loss factors and bank regulatory guidelines  which are subject to change  iv various qualitative factors 
since those factors are subject to changes in economic and other conditions and changes in regulatory guidelines or circumstances over which we have no control  the amount of the allowance may prove in the future to be insufficient to cover all of the loan losses we might incur in the future and  therefore  it may become necessary for us to increase the allowance from time to time to maintain its adequacy 
such increases are effectuated by means of a charge to income  referred to as the provision for loan losses  in our statement of our operations 
see results of operations provision for loan losses  above in this item the amount of the allowance is first determined by assigning reserve ratios for all loans 
all non accrual loans and other loans classified as special mention  substandard or doubtful classified loans or classification categories are then assigned certain allocations according to type of loans  with greater reserve ratios or percentages applied to loans deemed to be of a higher risk 
these ratios are determined based on prior loss history and industry guidelines and loss factors  by type of loan  adjusted for current economic factors 
on a quarterly basis  we utilize a classification migration model and individual loan review analysis tools as starting points for determining the adequacy of the allowance 
our loss migration analysis tracks a certain number of quarters of loan loss history and industry loss factors to determine historical losses by classification category for each loan type  except certain loans automobile  mortgage and credit cards  which are analyzed as homogeneous loan pools 
these calculated loss factors are then applied to outstanding loan balances 
we also conduct individual loan review analysis  as part of the allowance allocation process  applying specific monitoring policies and procedures in analyzing the existing loan portfolios 
in determining whether and the extent to which we will make adjustments to our loan loss migration model for purposes of determining the allowance  we also consider a number of qualitative factors that can affect the performance and the collectability of the loans in our loan portfolio 
such qualitative factors include the effects of changes that we may make in our loan policies or underwriting standards on the quality of the loans and the risks in our loan portfolios  trends and changes in local  regional and national economic conditions  as well as changes in industry specific conditions  and any other reasonably foreseeable events that could affect the performance or the collectability of the loans in our loan portfolios  material changes that may occur in the mix or in the volume of the loans in our loan portfolios that could alter  whether positively or negatively  the risk profile of those portfolios  changes in management or loan personnel or other circumstances that could  either positively or negatively  impact the application of our loan underwriting standards  the monitoring of nonperforming loans or our loan collection efforts  changes in the concentration of risk in the loan portfolio  and external factors that  in addition to economic conditions  can affect the ability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations  such as fires  earthquakes and terrorist attacks 

table of contents determining the effects that these qualitative factors may have on the performance of our loan portfolios requires numerous judgments  assumptions and estimates about conditions  trends and events which may subsequently prove to have been incorrect due to circumstances outside of our control 
moreover  the effects of qualitative factors such as these on the performance of our loan portfolios are often difficult to quantify 
as a result  we may sustain loan losses in any particular period that are sizable in relation to the allowance or that may even exceed the allowance 
in response to the economic recession  which has resulted in increased and relatively persistent high rates of unemployment  and the credit crisis that has led to a severe tightening in the availability of credit  preventing borrowers from refinancing their loans  we have i implemented more stringent loan underwriting standards  ii strengthened loan underwriting and approval processes and iii added personnel with experience in addressing problem assets

we project the future sources and uses of funds and maintain liquid funds for unanticipated events 
our primary sources of cash include cash we have on deposit at other financial institutions  payments on loans  proceeds from the sale or maturity of securities  and from sales of residential mortgage loans  increases in deposits and increases in borrowings principally from the federal home loan bank 
the primary uses of cash include funding new loans and making advances on existing lines of credit  purchasing investments  including securities available for sale  funding new residential mortgage loans  funding deposit withdrawals and paying operating expenses 
we maintain funds in overnight federal funds and other short term investments to provide for short term liquidity needs 
we also have obtained credit lines from the federal home loan bank and other financial institutions to meet any additional liquidity requirements 
our liquid assets  which included cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  interest earning deposits with financial institutions and unpledged securities available for sale excluding federal reserve bank and federal home loan bank stock totaled million  which represented of total assets  at december  cash flow used in operating activities 
although we incurred a net loss of million in  million of that loss represented non cash charges to the provision for income taxes to increase the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets 
see critical accounting policies deferred tax assets above in this section of this report 
due primarily to the use of million of cash to originate new mortgage loans and million of cash to fund net increases in other assets  which we funded primarily with million of cash generated by sales of mortgage loans  operating activities used net cash of million in cash flow provided by investing activities 
investing activities provided net cash of million  primarily attributable to million of proceeds from sales of securities available for sale and million of loan repayments  partially offset by million of purchases of securities available for sale 
cash flow used by financing activities 
in  we used net cash of million in financing activities  primarily to fund a million decrease in deposits and a net decrease of million in borrowings  partially offset by million of proceeds from our private placement of series a shares  which was completed in august ratio of loans to deposits 
the relationship between gross loans and total deposits can provide a useful measure of a bank s liquidity 
since repayment of loans tends to be less predictable than the maturity of investments and other liquid resources  the higher the loan to deposit ratio the less liquid are our assets 
on the other hand  since we realize greater yields on loans than we do on investments  a lower loan to deposit ratio can adversely affect interest income and earnings 
as a result  our goal is to achieve a loan to deposit ratio that appropriately balances the requirements of liquidity and the need to generate a fair return on our assets 
at december  and december   the loan to deposit ratios were and  respectively 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements loan commitments and standby letters of credit 
in order to meet the financing needs of our customers in the normal course of business  we make commitments to extend credit and issue standby commercial letters of credit to or for our customers 
at december  and  we had outstanding commitments to fund loans totaling approximately million and million  respectively 
commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and the customer may be required to pay a fee and meet other conditions in order to draw on those commitments or standby letters of credit 
we expect  based on historical experience  that many of the commitments will expire without being drawn upon and  therefore  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
to varying degrees  commitments to extend credit involve elements of credit and interest rate risk for us that are in excess of the amounts recognized in our balance sheets 
our maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the customers to whom such commitments are made could potentially be equal to the amount of those commitments 
as a result  before making such a commitment to a customer  we evaluate the customer s creditworthiness using the same underwriting standards that we would apply if we were approving loans to the customer 
in addition  we often require the customer to secure its payment obligations for amounts drawn on such commitments with collateral such as accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  income producing commercial properties  residential properties and properties under construction 
as a consequence  our exposure to credit and interest rate risk on such commitments is not different in character or amount than risks inherent in the outstanding loans in our loan portfolio 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee a payment obligation of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments to customers 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalent resources  together with available borrowings under our credit facilities  will be sufficient to enable us to meet any increases in demand for loans or in the utilization of outstanding loan commitments or standby letters of credit and any increase in deposit withdrawals that might occur in the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations borrowings 
as of december   we had million of outstanding short term borrowings and million of outstanding long term borrowings that we had obtained from the federal home loan bank 
the table below sets forth the amounts in thousands of dollars of  the interest rates we pay on  and the maturity dates of these federal home loan bank borrowings

junior subordinated debentures 
pursuant to rulings of the federal reserve board  bank holding companies were permitted to issue long term subordinated debt instruments that  subject to certain conditions  would qualify as and  therefore  augment capital for regulatory purposes 
at december   we had outstanding approximately million principal amount of year junior subordinated floating rate debentures the debentures  of which million qualified as tier capital for regulatory purposes as of december  see discussion below under the subcaption capital resources regulatory capital requirements 
set forth below is certain information regarding the debentures original issue dates principal amount interest rates maturity dates september  libor plus september october  libor plus october total subject to the receipt of prior regulatory approval  we may redeem the debentures  in whole or in part  without premium or penalty  at any time prior to maturity 
interest on the debentures is payable quarterly 
however  subject to certain conditions  we have the right to defer those interest payments for up to five years 
as previously reported  since july we have been required to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve bank of san francisco to make interest payments on the debentures 
during the quarter ended june   we were advised by the federal reserve bank that it would not approve the payments of interest on the debentures scheduled to be made on june and july  as a result  we exercised our right  pursuant to the terms of the debentures  to defer those interest payments 
in the fourth quarter of we were advised by the federal reserve bank that it would not approve our payment of the next two interest payments scheduled to be made in december and january  respectively 
as a result we have deferred those interest payments as well 
if we are unable to obtain federal reserve bank approval to pay the interest payments that will become due in june and july  then  it will be necessary for us to exercise our deferral rights with respect to those payments as well 
since we have the right  under the terms of the debentures to defer interest payments for up to five years  the deferral of interest payments to date did not  and any deferral of the june and july interest payments will not  constitute a default under or with respect to the debentures

other contractual obligations set forth below is information regarding our material contractual obligations as of december  operating lease obligations 
we lease certain facilities and equipment under various non cancelable operating leases  which include escalation clauses ranging between and per annum 
future minimum non cancelable lease commitments were as follows at december  at december  in thousands thereafter total maturing time certificates of deposits 
set forth below is a maturity schedule  as of december   of time certificates of deposit of  or more at december  in thousands and beyond total capital resources capital regulatory requirements applicable to banking institutions 
under federal banking regulations that apply to all united states based bank holding companies and federally insured banks  the company on a consolidated basis and the bank on a stand alone basis must meet specific capital adequacy requirements that  for the most part  involve quantitative measures  primarily in terms of the ratios of their capital to their assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items  calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
under those regulations  which are based primarily on those quantitative measures  each bank holding company must meet a minimum capital ratio and each federally insured bank is determined by its primary federal bank regulatory agency to come within one of the following capital adequacy categories on the basis of its capital ratios 
well capitalized adequately capitalized 
table of contents undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized  or critically undercapitalized certain qualitative assessments also are made by a banking institution s primary federal regulatory agency that could lead the agency to determine that the banking institution should be assigned to a lower capital category than the one indicated by the quantitative measures used to assess the institution s capital adequacy 
at each successive lower capital category  a banking institution is subject to greater operating restrictions and increased regulatory supervision by its federal bank regulatory agency 
the following table sets forth the capital and capital ratios of the company on a consolidated basis and the bank on a stand alone basis at december   as compared to the respective regulatory requirements applicable to them 
applicable federal regulatory requirement actual to be adequately capitalized to be well capitalized amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio total capital to risk weighted assets company   at least n a n a bank   at least  at least tier capital to risk weighted assets company   at least n a n a bank   at least  at least tier capital to average assets company   at least n a n a bank   at least  at least at december  the bank on a stand alone basis continued to qualify as a well capitalized institution  and the company continued to exceed the minimum required capital ratios  under the capital adequacy guidelines described above 
the consolidated total capital and tier capital of the company  at december   includes an aggregate of million principal amount of junior subordinated debentures that we issued in and we contributed that amount to the bank over the six year period ended december   thereby providing it with additional cash to fund the growth of its banking operations and  at the same time  to increase its total capital and tier capital 
additional capital requirements under frb agreement and dfi order 
on august   the members of the respective boards of directors of the company and the bank entered into the frb agreement and the bank consented to the issuance of the dfi order 
the principal purposes of the frb agreement and the dfi order  which constitute formal supervisory actions by the frb and the dfi  are to require us to adopt and implement formal plans and take certain actions  as well as to continue implementing measures that we previously adopted  to address the adverse consequences that the economic recession has had on the performance of our loan portfolio and our operating results and to increase our capital to strengthen our ability to weather any further adverse conditions that might arise if the improvement in the economy does not materialize or remains sluggish 
the agreement and order contain substantially similar provisions 
they require the boards of directors of the company and the bank to prepare and submit written plans to the frb and the dfi that address a number of matters  including improving the bank s position with respect to problem assets  maintaining adequate reserves for loan and lease losses in accordance with applicable supervisory guidelines  and improving the capital position of the bank and  in the case of the frb agreement  the capital position of the company 
the bank is also prohibited from paying dividends to the company without the prior approval of the dfi  and without the prior approval of the frb the company may not declare or pay cash dividends  repurchase any of its shares  make interest or principal payments on its debentures or incur or guarantee any debt 

table of contents the frb agreement also requires us to submit a capital plan to the frb that will meet with its approval and then implement that plan 
under the order  the bank was required to achieve a ratio of adjusted tangible shareholders equity to its tangible assets to by january   by raising additional capital  generating earnings or reducing the bank s tangible assets subject to a limitation on such a reduction or a combination thereof and  upon achieving that ratio  to thereafter maintain that ratio during the term of the order 
the dfi order also states that if we were to violate or fail to comply with the order the bank could be deemed to be conducting business in an unsafe manner which could subject the bank to further regulatory enforcement action 
the company and the bank already have made substantial progress with respect to several of these requirements and both the board and management are committed to achieving all of the requirements on a timely basis 
among other things  in august  we completed a private placement of its series a convertible preferred stock  raising gross proceeds of  of which  was contributed to the bank to increase its equity capital 
since the issuance of the dfi order  we also have made a concerted effort to raise the additional capital needed to increase the bank s ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets to by january   as required by the dfi order 
among other things  we retained a nationally recognized investment banking firm to assist us in those efforts and we have engaged in substantive discussions with a number of institutional investors that have expressed an interest in making a capital investment in the company and we are in negotiations with some of them with respect to the terms of such a capital investment 
however  as previously reported  notwithstanding those efforts  which are continuing  we were not able to raise the capital needed to increase the bank s ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets to by january   as required by the dfi order 
nevertheless  the dfi has notified us that it will not take any action against the bank at this time because the bank has not  as yet  met that capital requirement 
we understand that this decision was based on the progress we have made since august  in increasing the bank s capital ratio  improvements made in the bank s financial condition  including reductions in the bank s non performing assets  and the bank s classification as a well capitalized banking institution under federal bank regulatory guidelines and federally established prompt corrective action regulations 
we cannot  however  predict when or even if we will succeed in meeting the capital requirements of the dfi order in the near term and the dfi is not precluded from taking enforcement action against the bank if its financial condition were to worsen or if bank failed to achieve further improvements in its capital ratio 
additional information regarding the frb agreement and the dfi order is set forth above in the section entitled supervision and regulation in part i of this report  under the caption regulatory action by the frb and dfi 
sale of series a convertible cumulative preferred stock 
as previously reported in a current report filed with the sec on form k dated october   we commenced a private placement to a limited number of accredited investors as defined in regulation d under the securities act of  as amended of a new issue of series a convertible cumulative preferred stock the series a shares  at per series a share 
we sold a total of  series a shares  raising gross proceeds of million  in the private placement  which we concluded in august we have used those proceeds to make a million capital contribution to the bank to increase its equity capital and to provide it with cash to fund additional loans and other interest earning assets and meet working capital requirements  and for general corporate purposes 
dividends accrue and accumulate on the series a shares at a rate of per annum until paid and  at december   accumulated but unpaid dividends on the series a shares totaled  moreover  until such dividends are paid  we may not pay any dividends on our common stock 
each outstanding series a share is convertible at the option of its holder  at a conversion price of per share  into shares of our common stock as the same may be adjusted pursuant to the anti dilution provisions applicable to the series a shares 
on the second anniversary of the original issue date of the series a shares the automatic conversion date  all series a shares then outstanding will automatically convert into common stock at the then conversion price  subject to the payment by the company  in cash  of the accumulated  but unpaid  dividends on those series a shares 
if  however  due to regulatory restrictions or for any other reason  we are unable to pay the accumulated  but unpaid dividends on the automatic conversion date  in cash  then  the automatic conversion date will be extended  and those series a shares will remain outstanding and will continue to accumulate dividends  until such time as we are able to pay such dividends in cash 
a more detailed description of the rights  preferences and privileges of and restrictions on the series a shares is contained in the above referenced current report on form k dated october   and the foregoing summary is qualified by reference to that description 
although we have cash sufficient to pay the accumulated unpaid dividends on the series a shares the series a dividends  which totaled  at december   the frb agreement requires us to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve bank to pay any of those dividends 
we have been advised by the federal reserve bank that it does not intend to approve the payment of any series a dividends at least until we significantly increase our capital and achieve a return to profitability 
as a result  we expect that series a shares will continue to accrue dividends  at a rate of approximately  per quarter  for some time 
moreover  for accounting and public reporting purposes  accrued but unpaid series a dividends are recorded  and reduce the earnings or increase the loss allocable to common stockholders set forth  in the company s statement of operations 
see our consolidated financial statements in item of this report below 
dividend policy and share repurchase programs 
our board of directors has followed the policy of retaining earnings to maintain capital and  thereby  support the operations of the bank 
on occasion  the board has considered paying cash dividends out of cash generated in excess of those capital requirements and  in february  the board of directors declared a one time cash dividend  in the amount of per share of common stock  which was paid on march  to our shareholders 
the board also authorized share repurchase programs  in june and in october  when the board concluded that  at prevailing market prices  the company s shares represented an attractive investment opportunity and  therefore  that share repurchases would be a good use of company funds 
no shares were purchased under this program in or 
table of contents in the first quarter of  the board of directors decided that the prudent course of action  in light of the economic recession  was to preserve cash to enhance the bank s capital position and to be in a position to take advantage of improved economic and market conditions in the future 
moreover  the mou entered into with the frb and dfi in july and the frb agreement and dfi order which superseded the mou prohibit our payment of cash dividends and the making of share repurchases without the prior approval of those regulatory agencies 
accordingly  we do not expect to pay dividends or make share purchases at least for the foreseeable future
