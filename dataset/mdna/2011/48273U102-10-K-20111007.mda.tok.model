ebitda consists of net income loss  plus net interest expense  plus income tax expense  plus income tax expense benefit  plus depreciation and amortization and minus noncontrolling interest charges 
interest expense primarily consists of interest expense for capital leases  long term and short term borrowings 
we 
table of contents use ebitda in addition to income from operations and net income as a measure of operating performance 
however  ebitda is not a recognized measurement under us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and when analyzing our operating performance  investors should use ebitda in addition to  and not as an alternative for  net income loss as determined in accordance with gaap 
because not all companies use identical calculations  our presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
furthermore  ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management s discretionary use  as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as capital expenditures  tax payments  interest payments  or other working capital 
we believe ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it is widely used to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization  which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets  and to present a meaningful measure of corporate performance exclusive of our capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired 
our management uses ebitda as an additional measurement of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our performance on a consistent basis  in presentations to the members of our board of directors to enable our board to have the same measurement basis of operating performance as is used by management to compare our current operating results with corresponding prior periods and with the results of other companies in our industry  and  on an adjusted basis in determining compliance with the terms of our credit agreement

executive summary we are a technology based education company 
we offer proprietary curriculum  software systems and educational services designed to facilitate individualized learning for students primarily in kindergarten through th grade  or k our mission is to maximize a child s potential by providing access to an engaging and effective education  regardless of geographic location or socio economic background 
since our inception  we have invested more than million to develop and  to a lesser extent  acquire curriculum and online learning platforms that promote mastery of core concepts and skills for students of all abilities 
this learning system combines our curriculum and offerings with an individualized learning approach well suited for virtual public schools  hybrid schools  school district online programs  public charter schools and private schools that utilize varying degrees of online and traditional classroom instruction  and other educational applications 
we are also expanding our offering of foreign languages with middlebury interactive languages mil  our joint venture with middlebury college 
this year  we also expanded our international business by making an investment in a ownership interest in web international education group  ltd  a company providing english instruction to young adults in china  and also are investing in the post secondary market through capital education llc  our wholly owned subsidiary 
fiscal year was a transformational year for the company 
we increased revenues to million  from million  a growth rate of 
organic revenue growth  or excluding revenues from acquisitions and new initiatives  was 
we made three acquisitions during the year that  combined  enhance our online public school offering and provide our institutional business and private school distribution channels with meaningful scale 
in aggregate  acquisitions contributed to revenue growth in fiscal year we also 
table of contents launched several new initiatives including mil  capital education  and the management of two new facility based learning programs 
these initiatives contributed to revenue growth 
new distribution channels now position us to achieve diversified sources of revenue 
in addition  through our organic development efforts and acquisitions  we have amassed a library of over electronic courses spanning all grades k while our organic revenue growth was profitable  we incurred substantial expenses related to acquisition transactions and integration activities and incurred operating losses in our new initiatives 
in addition  we incurred expenses related to infrastructure enhancements  primarily financial systems and process improvements  which will allow us to support our planned future growth 
as a result of these activities and initiatives  in fiscal year operating income declined to million  from million  a decrease of  net income to shareholders declined to million  from million  a decrease of and ebitda  a non gaap measure see reconciliation of net income to ebitda in item selected financial data  increased to million  from million  an increase of 
as with a traditional public school  a virtual public school or hybrid school must comply with state education regulations 
the fundamental difference between traditional public schools and virtual public schools is that students attend virtual public schools and hybrid schools primarily over the internet instead of traveling to a physical classroom 
in their online learning environment  students receive assignments  complete lessons  and obtain instruction from certified teachers with whom they interact online  telephonically  in virtual classroom environments  and sometimes face to face 
as of  the majority of states have embraced virtual public schools or hybrid schools as a means to provide families with a publicly funded alternative to a traditional classroom based education 
for parents who believe their child is not thriving and for whom relocating or attending a private school is not an option  virtual public schools and hybrid schools can provide a compelling choice 
from an education policy standpoint  virtual public schools and hybrid schools often represent a savings to the taxpayers when compared with traditional public schools because they are generally funded at a lower per pupil level than the per pupil state average as reported by the us department of education 
finally  because parents are not required to pay tuition to attend a public school  virtual public schools and hybrid schools make our learning system an attractive alternative within the public school system 
our proprietary curriculum  online learning platform and varying levels of academic and management services  which can range from individual courses to complete turnkey online schools  are offered to our charter school  school district and private school partners 
virtual public schools and hybrid schools under turnkey management contracts managed schools accounted for approximately of our revenue in fiscal year for the school year  we will manage schools in states and the district of columbia

we are serving a growing number of hybrid schools  the first of which opened in chicago in a hybrid school is a virtual public school that combines the benefits of face to face time for students and teachers in a traditional classroom setting along with the flexibility and individualized learning advantages of online instruction 
we are serving a growing number of schools and school districts enabling them to offer our course catalogue to students either full time or on an individual course basis 
we have established a dedicated sales team to focus on this sector and  through our acquisition of kcdl in july and the american education corporation aec in december  we increased the size and expertise of our sales team  added a reseller network  and expanded our course portfolio 
the services we provide to these districts are designed to assist them in launching their own distance learning programs and vary according to the needs of the individual school districts and may include teacher training programs  administrator support and our student account management system 
with our services  districts can offer programs that allow students to participate full time  as their primary school  or part time  supplementing their education with core courses  electives or credit recovery options

kaplan k assets are being integrated with our online charter school and private school operations 
as part of the acquisition agreement  kaplan inc has agreed not to engage in similar efforts in the k marketplace for a period of years 
our history we were founded in to utilize the advances in technology to provide children access to a high quality public school education regardless of their geographic location or socio economic background 
given the geographic flexibility of technology based education  we believed that the pursuit of this mission could help address the growing concerns regarding the regionalized disparity in the quality of public school education  both in the united states and abroad 
the convergence of these concerns and rapid advances in internet technology created the opportunity to make a significant impact by deploying a high quality online learning systems on a flexible  online platform 
in september  after months of research and development of our curriculum  we introduced our kindergarten through nd grade offering 
we launched our initial online learning system in virtual public schools 
table of contents in pennsylvania and colorado  serving approximately students in the two states combined 
we added new grades over the first seven years and continue to manage schools in more states every year 
we have also launched hybrid programs that combine face to face time in the classroom with online instruction and opened an online private school to reach students worldwide 
for the school year  we managed schools in states and through our institutional business served schools in all states 
for the school year  we have been approved to manage schools in louisiana and tennessee bringing the total states with managed schools to the following table sets forth the grade levels offered  and new state s managed by school year for virtual public schools and hybrid schools school year grades offered of states with managed schools new states with managed schools sy k colorado  pennsylvania sy k arkansas  california  idaho  minnesota  ohio sy k arizona  florida  utah  wisconsin sy k kansas sy k texas sy k illinois  washington  sy k georgia  nevada sy k hawaii  indiana  oregon  south carolina sy k alaska  oklahoma  virginia  wyoming sy k massachusetts  michigan sy k louisiana  tennessee key aspects and trends of our operations revenues we generate a significant portion of our revenues from the sale of curriculum  management and technology services to virtual public schools and hybrid schools  where we provide turnkey management services 
in each of the past five years  more than of our revenues have been derived from this source 
we anticipate that these revenues will continue to represent the bulk of our total revenues over the next months  however we expect revenues in our other distribution channels to increase in proportion to our total revenues as we execute on our growth strategy 
these channels include schools and school districts our institutional business  private schools  consumer  post secondary and international 
factors affecting our revenues include i the number of enrollments  ii the management services provided to the schools and school districts  iii state or district per student funding levels and attendance requirements  iv prices for our products and services  v growth in our other distribution channels  and vi revenues from new initiatives  mergers and acquisitions 

table of contents we define an enrollment as a student using our curriculum 
generally  students will take four to six courses  except for some kindergarten students who may participate in half day programs 
we count each half day kindergarten student as an enrollment 
students served through our institutional business and private school offerings may enroll in a single course 
for better comparability  these students are converted to full time equivalents ftes on a four course basis 
school sessions generally begin in august or september and end in may or june 
to ensure that all schools are reflected in our measure of enrollments  we consider the number of students on the last day of september to be our opening enrollment level  and the number of students enrolled on the last day of may to be our ending enrollment level 
for each period  average enrollments represent the average of the month end enrollment levels for each school month in the period 
we continually evaluate our enrollment levels by state  by school and by grade 
we track new student enrollments and withdrawals throughout the year 
we believe that the number of enrollments depends upon the following the number of states and school districts in which we operate  the restrictive terms of local laws or regulations including enrollment caps  the appeal of our curriculum and instructional model to students and families  the specific school or school district requirements including credit recovery  ap  or special needs  the effectiveness of our program in delivering favorable academic outcomes  the quality of the teachers working in the schools we serve  and the effectiveness of our marketing and recruiting programs 
our reported total average enrollments include students in managed schools  students taking k curriculum or aventa online programs offered by school districts institutional business  and students in private schools 
we currently exclude selected programs from our reported enrollment 
for example  we do not include students in our consumer channel as we do not monitor the progress of these students in the same way as we do in other programs 
we typically sell our a curriculum acquired with aec as a site license 
as these schools are not limited in the number of students who may access our curriculum  we do not include these students in our enrollment totals 
we also exclude students from capital education and our classroom pilots 
in fiscal year  we increased total average enrollments by  or to  as compared to total average enrollments of  in fiscal year these figures include  enrollments obtained through acquisitions completed in fiscal year we continually evaluate our trends in revenues by monitoring the number of enrollments in total  by state  by school and by grade  assessing the impact of changes in school funding levels and the pricing of our curriculum and educational services 
in fiscal year  of our enrollments are associated with virtual public schools and hybrid schools to which we provide turnkey management services 
enrollments in these schools on average generate substantially more revenues than enrollments served through our institutional business where we provide limited or no management services 
similarly  revenues earned per enrollment across our private school programs vary 
as we continue to build our institutional business and increase enrollment in private schools  enrollment mix will shift and may impact growth in revenues relative to the growth in enrollments 
in fiscal year  we derived approximately of our revenues from each of the ohio virtual academy and the agora cyber charter school agora in pennsylvania 
in aggregate  these schools accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
we provide our full turnkey management solution pursuant to our contract with the ohio virtual academy  which terminates on june  we provide our full turnkey solution to the agora pursuant to a contract with the school that expires on june  the annual revenues generated under each of these contracts represent a material portion of our total revenues in fiscal year  however  as our other distribution channels grow  these proportions may decline 
our annual revenue growth is impacted by changes in federal  state and district per enrollment funding levels 
due to the budgetary problems arising from the economic recession  many states have reduced per enrollment funding for public education affecting many of the public schools we serve 
while the american 
table of contents recovery and reinvestment act of and education jobs and medicaid assistance act of have provided additional federal funds to states  they have not fully offset the state funding reductions 
our financial results reflect the state funding reductions  federal funds provided  and expense reductions that we undertook in order to mitigate the impact of these budget constraints 
notwithstanding this additional aid  net reductions in school funding have negatively affected both revenue and income for our last three fiscal years 
at this time  many states still have budget issues 
the specific level of federal  state and district funding for the coming years is not yet known  and taken as a whole  it is reasonable to believe that a number of the public schools we serve could experience lower per enrollment funding in the future 
we evaluate the combined pricing of our curriculum and educational services annually against market conditions and state funding levels and change them as we deem appropriate 
we do not expect our price changes to have a significant impact on revenues as they are generally encompassed within changes in per enrollment funding levels for virtual public schools and hybrid schools 
our growth strategy includes increasing revenues in other distribution channels  including accelerating sales to schools and school districts  adding enrollments in our private schools  and pursuing international opportunities to offer our learning system 
while the combined revenues from these channels are significantly smaller than that from the public schools we manage in fiscal year  the revenues are growing a faster rate 
our success in executing our strategies will impact future growth 
we also launched several new initiatives in fiscal year including mil  capital education  and the management of sf flex 
these initiatives contributed to revenue growth 
in addition  we will continue to pursue acquisitions at attractive valuations that complement our existing educational offering and business capabilities 
in fy  the acquisitions of kcdl  aec  and is berne contributed to revenue growth 
instructional costs and services expenses instructional costs and services expenses include expenses directly attributable to the educational products and services we provide 
the virtual public schools and hybrid schools we manage are the primary drivers of these costs  including teacher and administrator salaries and benefits and expenses of related support services 
we also employ teachers and administrators for instruction and oversight in our institutional business  private school and mmla summer programs 
instructional costs also include fulfillment costs of student textbooks and materials  depreciation and reclamation costs of computers provided for student use  and the cost of any third party online courses 
in addition  we include in instructional costs the amortization of capitalized curriculum and related systems 
we measure  track and manage instructional costs and services as a percentage of revenues and on a per enrollment basis as these are key indicators of performance and operating efficiency 
in the near term  we expect high school enrollments to grow as a percentage of total enrollments 
our high school offering requires increased instructional costs as a percentage of revenues compared to our kindergarten to th grade offering 
this is due to the following i generally lower student to teacher ratios  ii higher compensation costs for some teaching positions requiring subject matter expertise  iii ancillary costs for required student support services including college placement  sat preparation and guidance counseling  and vi use of third party courses to augment our proprietary curriculum 
over time  we anticipate partially offsetting these factors by obtaining productivity gains in our high school instructional model  replacing third party high school courses with proprietary content  leveraging our school infrastructure and obtaining purchasing economies of scale 
we have deployed and are continuing to develop new delivery models  including hybrid schools  where students receive face to face instruction in a learning center to complement their online instruction  and other programs that utilize a brick and mortar facility full time  including our operational management of the sf flex school and is berne 
these models necessitate additional costs including facilities related costs and additional administrative support  which are generally not required to operate typical virtual public schools and hybrid schools 
in addition  development costs may include instructional research and curriculum development 
as a result  instructional costs as a percentage of revenues may be higher than our fully virtual kindergarten through eighth grade offering 
in addition  we are pursuing expansion into new states 
if we are successful  we will incur start up costs and other expenses associated with the initial launch of a school  which may result in increased instructional costs as a percentage of revenues 

table of contents as a percentage of revenues  instructional costs and services expenses increased to for the year ended june   as compared to for the same period in the prior year 
this increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to increased amortization of curriculum and online learning systems  expenses for new initiatives that did not have the corresponding growth in revenues in the current period  and an increase in the percentage of high school enrollments relative to total enrollments  as high school enrollments have higher costs as a percentage of revenues due to increased teacher and related services costs 
these increases were partially offset by lower fulfillment costs for materials and computers  increased productivity at the schools we manage  and leverage of fixed school infrastructure costs 
selling  administrative and other operating expenses selling  administrative and other operating expenses include the salaries and benefits employees engaged in business development  public affairs  sales and marketing  and administrative functions and their related third party costs 
in addition  we include rent expense for our corporate headquarters  stock compensation expense  facility and corporate equipment depreciation and intangible amortization 
we also include litigation settlement costs  and transaction and due diligence expenses related to mergers and acquisitions 
we track selling  administrative and other operating expenses as a percentage of revenues to measure performance and efficiency of these areas 
in addition  we quantify sales and marketing efficiency including the number of new enrollment prospects  our ability to convert these prospects into enrollments  and our cost effectiveness of conversion 
we also review various call center statistics as indicators of operating efficiency and customer service including call handle rates  waiting time and customer satisfaction 
for fiscal year  our selling  administrative and other operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were  as compared to in the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributable to increases in personnel costs including those acquired with kcdl and aec  strategic marketing including brand awareness and student recruitment  professional services  depreciation and amortization including the effects of purchase accounting  m a transaction and integration expenses  financial systems and process improvement costs  and one time stock compensation expenses 
included in selling  administrative  and other operating expenses for fiscal year are expenses of million for several new initiatives 
also in fiscal year  transaction and merger integration expenses  financial systems and process improvement costs  and one time stock compensation expenses totaled million 
we continue to invest in our financial systems to allow us to more effectively operate a large and growing company that will be able to better serve the educational needs of students domestically and internationally 
product development expenses product development expenses include research and development costs and overhead costs associated with the management of both our curriculum development and internal systems development teams 
in addition  product development expenses include the amortization of internal systems and any related impairment charges 
we measure and track our product development expenditures on a per course or project basis to measure and assess our development efficiency 
in addition  we monitor employee utilization rates to evaluate our workforce efficiency 
in fiscal year  product development expenses increased as we acquired the development functions of kcdl and aec 
we plan to invest in additional curriculum development and related software in the future  primarily to produce additional high school courses  world language courses  and new releases of existing courses and to continue to upgrade our content management system and online schools 
we expect to gain efficiencies as we integrate the development capabilities of kcdl and aec and leverage our collective development efforts over an increasing base of enrollment 
we capitalize most of the costs incurred to develop our curriculum  beginning with application development  through production and testing into capitalized curriculum development costs 
we capitalize the costs incurred to develop internal systems into capitalized software development costs 
other factors that may affect comparability year to year amortization of capitalized curriculum and related systems 
we record amortization of capitalized curriculum and related systems in instructional costs and services expenses 

table of contents our amortization of capitalized curriculum and related systems for the years ended june   and in millions amortization of capitalized curriculum and related systems amortization as a of revenues we expect amortization of capitalized curriculum and related systems to continue to increase in the future as we place additional courses and systems in service 
stock based compensation expense 
we record stock based compensation expense in selling  administrative and other operating expenses 
our stock based compensation expense for the years ended june   and in millions stock based compensation expense stock compensation expense as a of revenues we expect stock based compensation expense to continue to increase in the future as we grant additional stock options and restricted stock awards as incentive compensation and to retain and attract employees 
income tax expense 
in the period from our inception through fiscal year  we incurred significant operating losses that resulted in a net operating loss carryforward for tax purposes 
however  in each of the three years ending june   we generated increasing enrollments  revenue and pre tax income 
as a result  in fiscal year  we determined it was more likely than not that substantially all of our net deferred tax assets would be utilized 
for the year ended june   we recognized a net income tax benefit of million 
this reflects the net effect of a million tax benefit from the reversal of the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets and an income tax expense of million  or of pretax income 
income tax expense for the year ended june  was million  or of pretax income 
for the year ended june   income tax expense was million  or of pretax income 
the tax rate of reflects the benefit of research and development tax credits 
this credit expired in december and was retroactively reinstated to january  during fiscal year ended june  without the benefit of these tax credits  the tax rate would have been 
for the year ended june   income tax expense was million  or of pretax income 
the tax rate of reflects the benefit of research and development tax credits 
without the benefit of these tax credits  the tax rate would have been 
in addition  the income tax rate for the year ended june  increased primarily due to nondeductible costs incurred in the current and prior periods related to transactions that closed during the year ended june  without these nondeductible transaction costs  income tax expense for the year ended june  would have been of income before taxes 
our income tax expense for the years ended june   and in millions income tax expense income tax expense as a of pretax income intangible asset amortization 
our intangible asset amortization for the years ended june   and in millions intangible asset amortization expense intangible asset amortization expense as a of revenues we recorded intangible assets of million in fiscal year related to three transactions 
these intangible assets have estimated useful lives from to years 
we expect intangible asset amortization to increase in fiscal year due to the full year impact of acquisitions which occurred during fiscal year and may increase further in future years as we make additional acquisitions 

table of contents public funding and regulation 
our public school customers are financed with federal  state and local government funding 
budget appropriations for education at all levels of government are determined through a political process and impacted by general economic conditions  and  as a result  our revenues may be affected by changes in appropriations 
decreases in funding could result in an adverse affect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
competition 
providing online education for grades k is becoming increasingly competitive and attracting significant new entrants 
as this competition intensifies  it could negatively effect our growth  revenues and operating margins 
with the introduction of new technologies and entrants  we expect this competition to intensify 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies have been discussed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition in accordance with accounting standards codification asc formerly sec staff accounting bulletin no 
we recognize revenues when the following conditions are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of physical goods or rendering of services is complete  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
once these conditions are satisfied  the amount of revenues we record is determined in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  codified in asc 
we have determined that the elements of our contracts are valuable to schools in combination  but do not have standalone value 
as a result  the elements within our multiple element contracts do not qualify for treatment as separate units of accounting 
accordingly  we account for revenues received under multiple element arrangements as a single unit of accounting and recognizes the entire arrangement based upon the approximate rate at which we incur the costs associated with each element 
while we have concluded that the elements of our contracts do not have standalone value  we invoice schools in accordance with the established contractual terms and rates 
generally  this means that for each enrolled student  we invoice their school on a per student basis for the following items access to our online school and online curriculum  learning kits  and student personal computers 
we also invoice for management and technology services 
we apply asc to each of these items as follows access to the online school and online curriculum 
our ols revenues are generally earned on a per course basis from schools and school districts 
students enrolled through a school are provided access to the ols and online curriculum 
revenues are earned ratably over the school year  typically months  or over the semester depending on the length of the course 
learning kits 
the lessons in our online school are often accompanied with selected printed materials  workbooks  laboratory materials and other manipulative items which we provide to students 
we 
table of contents generally ship all learning kits to a student when their enrollment is approved 
once materials have been shipped  our efforts are substantially complete 
therefore  we recognize revenues upon shipment 
shipments for schools that occur in the fourth fiscal quarter that are for the upcoming school year are recorded in deferred revenues 
we may also receive reclamation fee income when we reclaim materials for schools at the end of the school year or when a student withdraws from the school 
student personal computers 
we provide many enrolled families with the use of a personal computer and complete technical support through our call center 
revenues are generally earned ratably over the school year 
we will also earn revenues for reclamation services when a student withdraws and returns the computer or a computer needs to be exchanged 
management  technology and educational services 
under most of our statewide virtual public school and hybrid school contracts  we provide the boards of these schools with turnkey management and technology services 
we recognize these revenues ratably over the course of our fiscal year as administrative offices of the school remain open for the entire year 
our management and technology service fees are generally a contracted percentage of yearly school funding 
we review our estimates of funding periodically  and revise as necessary  amortizing any adjustments to earned revenues over the remaining portion of the fiscal year 
actual school funding may vary from these estimates or revisions  and the impact of these differences could have a material impact on our results of operations 
since the end of the school year coincides with the end of our fiscal year  we are generally able to base our annual revenues on actual school revenues 
we closely monitor the financial performance of the schools to which we provide turnkey management services 
under the contracts with these schools  we generally take responsibility for any operating expenses that they may incur in a given school year 
these expenses include our charges for products and services 
in some cases  the school operating expenses may exceed the revenues earned by the school resulting in an operating loss for the school 
a school operating loss may result from a combination of cost increases or funding reductions attributable to the following costs associated with new schools including the initial hiring of teachers  administrators and the establishment of school infrastructure  school requirements to establish contingency reserves  one time costs such as a legal claim  funding reductions due to the inability to qualify specific students for funding  regulatory or academic performance thresholds which may restrict the ability of a school to fund all expenses  inadequate school funding in particular states  and or burdensome regulation creating excessive costs 
the fact that a school has an operating loss in one year does not necessarily mean we anticipate losing money on the entire contract  however  a school operating loss may reduce our ability to collect invoices in full 
accordingly  our recognized revenues reflect this reduction 
we amortize the estimated school operating loss against revenues based upon the percentage of actual revenues in the period to total estimated revenues for the fiscal year 
we periodically review our estimates of full year school revenues and full year school operating expenses and amortize the net impact of any changes to these estimates over the remainder of our fiscal year 
actual school operating losses may vary from these estimates or revisions  and the impact of these differences could have a material impact on our results of operations 
since the end of the school year coincides with the end of our fiscal year  we are generally able to base our annual revenues on actual school revenues and use actual costs incurred in our calculation of school operating losses 
in aggregate  the operating losses of the schools we manage have grown substantially 
we expect school operating losses to decline in some schools as their enrollment increases and they obtain scale 
in aggregate  we expect school operating losses to continue to grow due to start up costs in new states  additional investment in educational programs  and the higher costs associated with our high school offering 

table of contents the amount of revenues we record is determined in accordance with asc for the schools where we provide turnkey management services  we have determined that we are the primary obligor for substantially all expenses of the school 
accordingly  we report certain revenues on a gross basis by recording the associated per student revenues received by the school up to the expenses incurred by the school 
these associated gross revenues are recognized when the underlying expenses are incurred by the school 
in certain managed school contracts  our revenue is determined directly by per enrollment funding 
as our services are performed over the fiscal year  we generally earn and recognize revenues ratably over that period 
under our institutional business distribution channel  we provide services for a school or school district without any fiscal responsibility  and recognize revenues on a net basis 
revenues in our private schools are recognized based upon the services provided as described above 
we generate a small percentage of our revenues from the sale of perpetual licenses of curriculum and ongoing support to schools 
under asc  we account for the license and support of separate units of accounting and recognize revenues associated with the license up front and ongoing maintenance and support over the performance period 
we also generate a small percentage of our revenues through the sale of our online courses and learning kits directly to consumers 
online course sales are generally month to month subscriptions or for periods of months and customers have the option of paying a discounted amount in full upfront or paying in monthly installments 
for those customers electing to pay these subscription fees in their entirety upfront  we record the payment as deferred revenue and amortize the revenues over the life of the subscription 
for customers paying monthly  we recognize these payments as revenues in the month earned 
revenues for learning kits are recognized when shipped 
capitalized curriculum development costs our curriculum is primarily developed by our employees and to a lesser extent  by independent contractors 
generally  our courses cover traditional subjects and utilize examples and references designed to remain relevant for long periods of time 
the online nature of our curriculum allows us to incorporate user feedback rapidly and make ongoing corrections and improvements 
for these reasons  we believe that our courses  once developed  have an extended useful life  similar to computer software 
we also create textbooks and other offline materials 
our curriculum is integral to our learning system 
our customers do not acquire our curriculum or future rights to it 
due to the similarity in development stages and long economic life of curriculum to computer software  we capitalize curriculum development costs incurred during the application development stage in accordance with asc formerly statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
asc provides guidance for the treatment of costs associated with computer software development and defines those costs to be capitalized and those to be expensed 
costs that qualify for capitalization are external direct costs  payroll  and payroll related costs 
costs related to general and administrative functions are not capitalizable and are expensed as incurred 
we capitalize curriculum development costs during the design  development and deployment phases of the project 
many of our new courses leverage off of proven delivery platforms and are primarily content  which has no technological hurdles 
as a result  a significant portion of our courseware development costs qualify for capitalization due to the concentration of our development efforts on the content of the courseware 
technological feasibility is established when we have completed all planning  designing  coding  and testing activities necessary to establish that a course can be produced to meet its design specifications 
capitalization ends when a course is available for general release to our customers  at which time amortization of the capitalized costs begins 
capitalized costs are recorded in capitalized curriculum development costs 
the period of time over which these development costs will be amortized is generally five years 
this is consistent with the capitalization period used by others in our industry and corresponds with our product development lifecycle 
software developed or obtained for internal use we develop our own proprietary computer software programs to provide specific functionality to support both our unique education offering and the student and school management services 
these programs enable us to develop courses  process student enrollments  meet state documentation requirements  track student academic 
table of contents progress  deliver online courses to students  coordinate and track the delivery of course specific materials to students and provide teacher support and training 
these applications are integral to our learning system and we continue to enhance existing applications and create new applications 
our customers do not acquire our software or future rights to it 
we capitalize software development costs incurred during the development stage of these applications in accordance with asc formerly sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
these capitalized development costs are included in capitalized software development costs and are generally amortized over three years 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets include property  equipment  capitalized curriculum and software developed or obtained for internal use 
in accordance with asc formerly statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our recorded long lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
we determine the extent to which an asset may be impaired based upon our expectation of the asset s future usability as well as on a reasonable assurance that the future cash flows associated with the asset will be in excess of its carrying amount 
if the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss is recognized for the difference between fair value and the carrying value of the asset 
there were no impairment charges for the years ended june  and we recorded impairment charges on capitalized curriculum of million for the year ended june  income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes  formerly sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
asc prescribes the use of the asset and liability method to compute the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and the related financial amounts  using currently enacted tax laws 
if necessary  a valuation allowance is established  based on the weight of available evidence  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
realization of the deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  is principally dependent upon achievement of sufficient future taxable income 
we exercise significant judgment in determining our provisions for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future tax benefit from our deferred tax assets 
however  our ability to forecast sufficient future taxable income is subject to certain market factors that we may not be able to control such as a material reduction in per pupil funding levels  legislative budget cuts reducing or eliminating the products and services we provide and government regulation 
from inception through fiscal year  we had generated significant losses 
however  in the three years ending june  we generated increasing operating profit 
in addition  our revenues are dependent  among other things  upon the number of student enrollments 
during the recruiting season for fall  we received enrollment applications that would provide for additional growth for fiscal year when considering this positive evidence of future profitability  we believed that our recent history of generating positive pre tax income is sustainable and is expected to continue to grow as a result of the increasing revenues primarily from virtual public schools 
consequently  as we believed that it is more likely than not that we would be able to utilize substantially all of our net deferred tax asset  we reversed approximately million of the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset for the year ended june  although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable  the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgments that could become subject to examination by tax authorities in the ordinary course of business 
we periodically assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the impact on our deferred taxes and income tax liabilities and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
changes in income tax legislation  statutory income tax rates  or future taxable income levels  among other things  could materially impact our valuation of income tax assets and liabilities and could cause our income tax provision to vary significantly among financial reporting periods 

table of contents as of june   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of million that expire between and if unused 
we maintain a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets of million as of june  related to state income taxes and foreign net operating losses as we believe it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize these deferred tax assets 
due to our net operating loss carryforwards  we do not expect to pay federal income taxes in the next twelve months  other than the alternative minimum tax 
federal net operating loss carryforwards as of june  include million and million of federal net operating losses generated by kcdl and aec  respectively  in prior periods  which the company expects to utilize 
accounting for stock based compensation effective july   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of asc using the prospective transition method which requires the company to apply the provisions of asc only to awards granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled after july  equity based compensation expense for all equity based compensation awards granted after july  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc the company recognizes these compensation costs on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period of the award 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is the fair market value on the date of grant 
we use the black scholes option pricing model method to calculate the fair value of stock options 
the use of option valuation models requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of the option 
goodwill and other intangibles we record as goodwill the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
finite lived intangible assets acquired in business combinations subject to amortization are recorded at their fair value in accordance with asu finite lived intangible assets include the trade names  customer contracts and non compete agreements

 goodwill and other intangible assets  prescribes a two step process for impairment testing of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives  which is performed annually  as well as when an event triggering impairment may have occurred 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life are tested for impairment on an annual basis  or earlier when events or changes in circumstances suggest the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable

while school administrative offices are generally open year round  a school typically serves students during a month academic year 
a school s academic year typically begins in august or september  our first fiscal quarter  and finishes in may or june  our fourth fiscal quarter 
consequently  our first and fourth fiscal quarters reflect fewer than three complete months of operations when compared to the second and third fiscal quarters 
in the first fiscal quarter  we ship materials to students for the beginning of the school year 
new students will enroll after the start of the school year  but in significantly smaller numbers 
this generally results in higher materials revenues and margin in the first quarter versus other quarters 
in the first and fourth fiscal quarters  online curriculum and computer revenues are generally lower as these revenues are primarily earned during the school academic year which may provide for only one or two months of these revenues in these quarters versus the second and third fiscal quarters 
management and technology service revenues are recognized ratably over the course of our fiscal year 
the combined effect of these factors results in slightly higher revenues in the first fiscal quarter than in the subsequent quarters 
operating expenses are also seasonal 
instructional costs and services expenses increase in the first fiscal quarter primarily due to the costs incurred to ship student materials at the beginning of the school year 
instructional costs may increase significantly quarter to quarter as school operating expenses increase 
for example  enrollment growth will require additional teaching staff  thereby increasing salary and benefits expense 
school events may be seasonal  eg professional development  proctored exam related expenses  and community events impacting the quarterly change in instructional costs 
the majority of our recruiting and enrollment expenses are incurred in the first and fourth fiscal quarters  as our primary enrollment season is july through september 
a significant portion of our overhead expenses does not vary with the school year or enrollment season 
discussion of seasonality of financial condition certain accounts in our balance sheet are subject to seasonal fluctuations 
as our enrollments and revenues grow  we expect these seasonal trends to be amplified 
the bulk of our materials are shipped to students prior to 
table of contents the beginning of the school year  usually in july or august 
in order to prepare for the upcoming school year  we generally build up inventories during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
therefore  inventories tend to be at the highest levels at the end of our fiscal year 
in the first quarter of our fiscal year  inventories tend to decline significantly as materials are shipped to students 
in our fourth quarter  inventory purchases and the extent to which we utilize early payment discounts will impact the level of accounts payable 
accounts receivable balances tend to be at the highest levels in the first quarter of our fiscal year as we begin billing for all enrolled students and our billing arrangements include upfront fees for many of the elements of our offering 
these upfront fees result in seasonal fluctuations to our deferred revenue balances 
generally  deferred revenue balances related to the schools tend to be highest in the first quarter  when the majority of students enroll 
since the deferred revenue is amortized over the course of the school year  which ends in june  the balance is typically at its lowest at the end of our fiscal year 
generally  deferred revenues from virtual public schools and hybrid schools have not been a source of liquidity as most schools receive their funding over the course of the year 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded deferred revenues for early materials shipments for the upcoming school year 
also  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we received an early payment for the upcoming school year however that is not typical 
the deferred revenue related to our direct to consumer business results from advance payments for month subscriptions to our online school 
these advance payments are amortized over the life of the subscription and tend to be highest at the end of the fourth quarter and first quarter  when the majority of subscriptions are sold 
also at the end of the fourth quarter  we will record deferred revenues for the middlebury summer language program as students typically prepay for attending the programs that conclude in july

our accounts receivable provide an additional source of liquidity as cash payments are collected from customers in the normal course of business 
our accounts receivable balance fluctuates throughout the year based on the timing of customer billings and collections and accounts receivable tend to be at the highest levels in the first quarter as we begin billing for students 
we have a million revolving credit agreement with pnc bank credit agreement that expires december pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement  the proceeds of the term loan facility are to be used for general corporate purposes 
because of the seasonality of our business and timing of funds received  the school expenditures are higher in relation to funds received in certain periods during the year 
the credit agreement provides the ability to fund these periods until cash is received from the schools 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest based upon the terms of the borrowings 
interest is charged  at our option  either at i the higher of a the rate of interest announced by pnc bank from time to time as its prime rate and b the federal funds rate plus  or ii the applicable london interbank offered rate libor divided by a number equal to minus the maximum aggregate reserve requirement which is imposed on member banks of the federal reserve system against eurocurrency liabilities plus the applicable margin for such loans  which ranges between and  based on the leverage ratios as defined in the credit agreement

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at june  and june   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million and million  respectively 
future interest and investment income is subject to the impact of interest rate changes and we may be subject to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
at june   a gross increase in interest rates earned on cash would result in million annualized increase in interest income 
our short term debt obligations under our revolving credit facility are subject to interest rate exposure  however as we had no outstanding balance on this facility as of june   fluctuations in interest rates would not have a material impact on our interest expense 
foreign currency exchange risk we currently operate in several foreign countries  but we do not transact a material amount of business in a foreign currency and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
however  we are pursuing additional opportunities in international markets and expect our international presence to grow 
if we enter into any material transactions in a foreign currency or establish or acquire any subsidiaries that measure and record their financial condition and results of operation in a foreign currency  we will be exposed to currency transaction risk and or currency translation risk 
exchange rates between us dollars and many foreign currencies have fluctuated significantly over the last few years and may continue to do so in the future 
accordingly  we may decide in the future to undertake hedging strategies to minimize the effect of currency fluctuations on our financial condition and results of operations
