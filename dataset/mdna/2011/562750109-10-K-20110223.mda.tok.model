net platform to unify logistics functions 
early in the company s history  our offerings were heavily focused on warehouse management solutions 
as the company grew in size and scope  our offerings expanded across the entire supply chain 
as a result of the company s historical beginnings however  we still enjoy significant presence in  and a relatively strong concentration of revenues from  warehouse management solutions  which are a component of our distribution management solution suite 
over time  as our non warehouse management solutions have proliferated and increased in capability  the company s revenue concentration in its warehouse management solutions has correspondingly decreased 
our business model is singularly focused on the development and implementation of complex supply chain software solutions that are designed to optimize supply chain effectiveness and efficiency for our customers 
we have three principal sources of revenue license revenue generated from the sales of our supply chain software  professional services derived from implementing our solutions along with customer support services and software enhancements services  and hardware sales and other revenue 
in  we generated million in total revenue  with a revenue mix of license revenues  services  and hardware and other revenue 
we manage our business based on three geographic regions north america and latin america americas  europe  middle east and africa emea  and asia pacific apac 
geographic revenue is based on the location of the sale 
our international revenue was approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  which represents approximately  and of our total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
international revenue includes all revenue derived from sales to customers outside the united states 
at december   we employed approximately  employees worldwide  of which approximately employees are based in the americas  approximately employees in emea  and approximately employees in apac and india 
we have offices in australia  china  france  india  japan  the netherlands  singapore and the united kingdom  as well as representatives in mexico and reseller partnerships in latin america  eastern europe  the middle east  south africa and asia 
global economic trends and industry factors global macro economic trends  technology spending and supply chain management market growth are important barometers for our business 
in  approximately of our total revenue was generated in the united states  in emea and the balance in apac  canada and latin america 
in addition  industry analysts estimate that approximately two thirds of every supply chain software solutions dollar invested is spent in the united states  consequently  the health of the us economy has a meaningful impact on our financial results 
we sell technology based solutions with total pricing  including software and services  in many cases exceeding million 
reductions in capital budgets of our customers and prospective customers have had an adverse impact on our ability to sell our solutions 
the concerns over the slow economic recovery within the united states and geographic regions in which we operate continues to affect customers and prospects decisions regarding timing of strategic capital spend 
timing of deals closed can have a material adverse impact on our business and is likely to further intensify competition in our already highly competitive markets 

table of contents in january  the international monetary fund imf provided a world economic outlook weo update raising its previous world economic growth forecast from october the update noted that  global output is projected to expand by percent in  an upward revision of about percentage point relative to the october weo 
this reflects stronger than expected activity in the second half of as well as new policy initiatives in the united states that will boost activity this year 
but downside risks to the recovery remain elevated 
advanced economies  which represent our primary revenue markets  are projected to expand sluggishly through and with annual growth of approximately 
in  we recognized five license deals greater than million 
in contrast  in  we recognized nine license deals greater than million and view this as a positive sign the economy is continuing to stabilize and customers and prospects are beginning to more actively plan for supply chain investment 
while our results signal improving demand  we experienced second half slow down in license deals closed over million due to continued macro economic turbulence and uncertainty in the united states and western europe 
as a result  we and our customers still remain cautious regarding the global economic recovery as noted by imf s world economic outlook 
when reviewing our results compared to it is important to highlight temporary expense actions instituted in to offset the impact of the global economic crisis on our revenue 
during we had no annual merit salary increases  our executives and board of directors absorbed a salary reduction  we asked many of our employees to take unpaid furlough days and we dramatically reduced many other expenses to help offset a revenue decline versus moreover  due to poor financial results  incentive compensation was significantly reduced 
in  we had total revenue of million for the full year  a decline in total revenue compared to the full year of without sacrificing investment in innovation  our aggressive measures to reduce costs enabled us to achieve million in operating profit in  with positive operating margins of 
for  we have restored executives and board of directors salaries to pre reduction levels  eliminated unpaid furlough days and provided merit increases to our employees  among other actions  to ensure long term success 
we expect expense comparisons will largely normalize in versus in  with improving macro economic conditions  we achieved total revenue growth  representing a strong rebound from license revenue and services revenue increased and  respectively  for full year as compared to the same period in as a result of an improving demand environment 
revenue license revenue license revenue  a leading indicator of our business  is primarily derived from software license fees that customers pay for supply chain solutions 
in  license revenue totaled million  or of total revenue  with gross margins of 
for the year ended december   americas  emea and apac recognized million  million  and million in license revenue  respectively 
our annual license revenue percentage mix of new and existing customers was approximately and  and over the past three years has averaged about and 
we believe our mix of new customer to existing customer license sales is well balanced  reflecting solid demand from our install base  as well as from new customers in a tough macro economic environment 
license revenue growth is influenced by the strength of general economic and business conditions and the competitive position of our software products 
our license revenue generally has long sales cycles of which the timing of the closing of a few large license transactions can have a material impact on our quarterly license revenues  operating profit  operating margins and earnings per share 
for example  million of license revenue in equates to approximately three cents of diluted earnings per share impact 
our software solutions are singularly focused on the supply chain planning and execution markets  which are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change 
we are a market leader in the supply chain management software solutions market as defined by industry analysts such as amr  arc and gartner 
our goal is to extend our position as a leading global supply chain solutions provider by growing our license revenues faster than our competitors 
we expect to continue to face increased competition from erp and scm applications vendors and business application software vendors that may broaden their solution offerings by internally developing or by acquiring or partnering with independent developers of supply chain planning and execution software 
increased competition could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
services revenue our services business consists of professional services consulting and training and customer support services and software enhancements 
in  our services revenue totaled million  or of total revenue  with gross margins of 
the americas  emea and apac realized million  million  and million  respectively  in services revenue for the year ended december  professional services accounted for over of total services revenue and approximately of total revenue in when comparing our operating margins to other technology companies  our consolidated operating margin profile can be lower due to our large services revenue mix as a percentage of total revenue 
while we believe our services margins are very strong  they do lower our overall operating margin as services margins are lower than license revenue margins 

table of contents at december   our professional services organization totaled approximately employees  accounting for of our total employees worldwide 
our professional services organization provides our customers with expertise and assistance in planning and implementing our solutions 
to ensure a successful product implementation  consultants assist customers with the initial installation of a system  the conversion and transfer of the customer s historical data onto our system  and ongoing training  education and system upgrades 
we believe our professional services enable customers to implement our software rapidly  ensure the customer s success with our solution  strengthen our customer relationships  and add to our industry specific knowledge base for use in future implementations and product innovations 
although our consulting services are optional  the majority of our customers use at least some portion of these services for the implementation and ongoing support of our software solutions 
consulting services are typically rendered under time and materials based contracts with services typically billed on an hourly basis 
professional services are sometimes rendered under fixed fee based contracts with payments due on specific dates or milestones 
typically  our consulting services lag license revenue by several quarters  as implementation services are performed after the purchase of the software 
services revenue growth is contingent upon license revenue growth  which is influenced by the strength of general economic and business conditions and the competitive position of our software products 
in addition  our consulting services business has competitive exposure to offshore providers and other consulting companies 
all of these factors potentially create the risk of pricing pressure  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
for customer support services and software enhancements csse  we offer a comprehensive program that provides our customers with software upgrades when and if available that offer additional or improved functionality and technological advances incorporating emerging supply chain and industry initiatives 
we offer hour customer support every day of the year plus software upgrades for an annual fee that is paid in advance 
our csse revenues totaled million in  representing approximately of services revenue and approximately of total revenue  respectively 
the growth of csse revenues is influenced by new license revenue growth  annual renewal of support contracts  increase in customers through acquisitions  and fluctuations in currency rates 
substantially all of our customers renew their annual support contracts 
over the last three years  our annual revenue renewal rate of customers subscribing to comprehensive support and enhancements has been greater than 
csse revenue is generally paid in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement  typically months 
csse renewal revenue is not recognized unless payment is received from the customer 
hardware and other revenue our hardware and other revenues totaled million in representing of total revenue with gross margins of 
during  americas  emea and apac were responsible for million  million  and million  respectively  in hardware and other revenues 
in conjunction with the licensing of our software  and as a convenience for our customers  we resell a variety of hardware products developed and manufactured by third parties 
these products include computer hardware  radio frequency terminal networks  rfid chip readers  bar code printers and scanners  and other peripherals 
we resell all third party hardware products pursuant to agreements with manufacturers or through distributor authorized reseller agreements pursuant to which we are entitled to purchase hardware products at discount prices and to receive technical support in connection with product installations and any subsequent product malfunctions 
we generally purchase hardware from our vendors only after receiving an order from a customer 
as a result  we do not maintain hardware inventory 
other revenue represents amounts associated with reimbursements from customers for out of pocket expenses 
the total amount of expense reimbursement recorded to hardware and other revenue was million  million and million for  and  respectively 

table of contents product development we intend to continue to invest significantly in research and development r d  which historically has averaged about cents of every revenue dollar  to provide market leading solutions that help global manufacturers  wholesalers  distributors  retailers and logistics providers successfully manage accelerating and fluctuating demands as well as the increasing complexity and volatility of their local and global supply chains 
our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
at december   our r d organization totaled approximately employees  located in the us and india  representing about of our total employees worldwide 
we will continue to focus our r d resources on the development and enhancement of supply chain software solutions 
we offer what we believe to be the broadest solution portfolio in the supply chain solutions marketplace  to address all aspects of planning and forecasting  inventory optimization  order lifecycle management  transportation lifecycle management and distribution management 
we also plan to continue to provide enhancements to existing solutions and to introduce new solutions to address evolving industry standards and market needs 
we identify further enhancements to existing solutions and opportunities for new solutions through our customer support organization  as well as through ongoing customer consulting engagements and implementations  interactions with our user groups  association with leading industry analysts and market research firms  and participation on industry standards and research committees 
our solutions address the needs of customers in various vertical markets  including retail  consumer goods  food and grocery  logistics service providers  industrial and wholesale  high technology and electronics  life sciences and government 
cash flow and financial condition for  we generated cash flow from operating activities of million and have generated a cumulative total of million for the three years ended december  our cash and investments at december  totaled million  with no debt on our balance sheet 
we currently have no credit facilities 
during the past three years  our primary uses of cash have been funding investment in r d and operations to drive earnings growth and to repurchase common stock 
during  we repurchased approximately million of manhattan associates outstanding common stock under the repurchase program approved by our board throughout the year 
in january  our board of directors approved raising our remaining share repurchase authority to million 
in  we anticipate that our priorities for use of cash will be similar to prior years  with our first priority being continued investment in product development and profitably growing our business to extend our market leadership 
we will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that are complementary to our product footprint and technology direction 
we will also continue to weigh our share repurchase options against cash for acquisitions and investing in the business 
we do not anticipate any borrowing requirements in for general corporate purposes 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
we believe that estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
to the extent there are material differences between those estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates  judgments and assumptions are revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of goodwill  accounting for income taxes  and stock based compensation 
revenue recognition our revenue consists of revenues from the licensing and hosting of software  fees from implementation and training services collectively  professional services  plus customer support services and software enhancements  and sales of hardware and other other consists of reimbursements of out of pocket expenses incurred by professional services 
all revenue is recognized net of any related sales taxes 

table of contents we recognize license revenue when the following criteria are met a signed contract is obtained  delivery of the product has occurred  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
revenue recognition for software with multiple element arrangements requires recognition of revenue using the residual method when a there is vendor specific objective evidence of the fair values of all undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement that is not accounted for using long term contract accounting  b vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement  and c all other applicable revenue recognition criteria for software revenue recognition  other than the requirement for vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of each delivered element of the arrangement are satisfied 
for those contracts that contain significant customization or modifications  license revenue is recognized using contract accounting 
we allocate revenue to customer support and software enhancements and any other undelivered elements of the arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value of each element and such amounts are deferred until the applicable delivery criteria and other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the balance of the revenue  net of any discounts inherent in the arrangement  is recognized at the outset of the arrangement using the residual method as the product licenses are delivered 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of each undelivered element based on the vsoe of fair value  we defer revenue recognition until all elements are delivered  all services have been performed  or until fair value can be objectively determined 
we must apply judgment in determining all elements of the arrangement and in determining the vsoe of fair value for each element  considering the price charged for each product on a stand alone basis or applicable renewal rates 
the accounting related to license revenue recognition in the software industry is complex and affected by interpretations of the rules which are subject to change 
our judgment is required in assessing the probability of collection  which is generally based on evaluation of customer specific information  historical collection experience and economic market conditions 
if market conditions decline  or if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  we may be unable to determine that collectibility is probable  and we could be required to defer the recognition of revenue until we receive customer payments 
our services revenue consists of fees generated from professional services  customer support services and software enhancements related to our software products 
fees from professional services performed by us are generally billed on an hourly basis  and revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
professional services are sometimes rendered under agreements in which billings are limited to contractual maximums or based upon a fixed fee for portions of or all of the engagement 
revenue related to fixed fee based contracts is recognized on a proportional performance basis based on the hours incurred on discrete projects within an overall services arrangement 
project losses are provided for in their entirety in the period in which they become known 
revenue related to customer support services and software enhancements is generally paid in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement  typically months 
hardware and other revenue is generated from the resale of a variety of hardware products  developed and manufactured by third parties that are integrated with and complementary to our software solutions 
as part of a complete solution  our customers periodically purchase hardware from us in conjunction with the licensing of software 
these products include computer hardware  radio frequency terminal networks  radio frequency identification rfid chip readers  bar code printers and scanners and other peripherals 
hardware revenue is recognized upon shipment to the customer when title passes 
we generally purchase hardware from our vendors only after receiving an order from a customer 
as a result  we do not maintain hardware inventory 
in accordance with the other presentation matters within the revenue recognition topic of the financial accounting standards board s fasb accounting standards codification  we recognize amounts associated with reimbursements from customers for out of pocket expenses as revenue 
such amounts have been included in hardware and other revenue 
the total amount of expense reimbursement recorded to revenue was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts generally represent a sales allowance on services revenue  which are recorded to operations as a reduction to services revenue 
while such losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same loss rates that we have in the past 

table of contents valuation of goodwill in accordance with the intangibles goodwill and other topic of the fasb accounting standards codification  we do not amortize goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
our goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test  which requires us to estimate the fair value of our business compared to the carrying value 
the impairment reviews require an analysis of future projections and assumptions about our operating performance 
should such review indicate the assets are impaired  we would record an expense for the impaired assets 
annual tests or other future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our goodwill is impaired 
for example  if we had reason to believe that our recorded goodwill had become impaired due to decreases in the fair market value of the underlying business  we would have to record a charge to income for that portion of goodwill that we believed was impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
at december   our goodwill balance was million 
accounting for income taxes we provide for the effect of income taxes on our financial position and results of operations in accordance with the income taxes topic of the fasb accounting standards codification 
under this accounting pronouncement  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for the change in net deferred tax assets or liabilities resulting from events that are recorded for financial reporting purposes in a different reporting period than recorded in the tax return 
management must make significant assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws  allowable deductions  projected tax credits and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
we do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position 
if the recognition threshold is met  we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that  in our judgment  is greater than percent likely to be realized 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our financial position and results of operations 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of our net deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
stock based compensation in january our compensation committee approved certain changes to our historical equity incentive grant practices  with the objective to optimize the company s performance and retention strength while managing program share usage to improve long term equity overhang 
the change eliminated stock option awards in favor of restricted stock grants  which for the awards contain vesting provisions that are service based and performance based 
the awards have a four year vesting period  with the performance portion tied to revenue and adjusted earnings per share targets 
for our historical stock option grants  we estimated the fair value on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
we based our estimate of fair value on certain assumptions  including the expected term of the option  the expected volatility of the price of the underlying share for the expected term of the option  the expected dividends on the underlying share for the expected term  and the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the option 
we based our expected volatilities on a combination of the historical volatility of our stock and the implied volatility of publicly traded options issued by third party for our common stock 
due to the limited trading volume of publicly traded options for our common stock  we placed a greater emphasis on historical volatility of our common stock 
we also used historical data to estimate the term that options are expected to be outstanding 
we based the risk free interest rate on the rate for us treasury zero coupon issues with a term approximating the expected term 
we recognize compensation cost for service based awards with graded vesting on a straight line basis over the entire vesting period  with the amount of compensation cost recognized at any date at least equal to the portion of the grant date value of the award that is vested at that date 
for our performance based restricted stock awards with graded vesting  we recognize compensation cost on an accelerated basis applying straight line expensing for each separately vesting portion of each award 
compensation cost recognized in any period is impacted by the number of stock based awards granted  the vesting period of the awards which generally is four years  the estimated forfeiture rate  and the probable outcome of any performance conditions

in addition  in we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million on an investment in an auction rate security

under these agreements  we agree to indemnify  defend and hold harmless the customer in connection with patent  copyright or trade secret infringement claims made by third parties with respect to the customer s authorized use of our products and services 
the indemnity provisions generally provide for our control of defense and settlement and cover costs and damages finally awarded against the customer  as well as our modification of the product so it is no longer infringing or  if it cannot be corrected  return of the product for a refund

the indemnity obligations contained in sales agreements generally have no specified expiration date and no specified monetary limitation on the amount of award covered 
we have not previously incurred costs to settle claims or pay awards under these indemnification obligations 
we account for these indemnity obligations in accordance with fasb guidance on accounting for contingencies  and record a liability for these obligations when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign business our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
our international operations currently include business activity out of offices in the united kingdom  the netherlands  france  australia  china  japan  singapore and india 
when the us dollar strengthens against a foreign currency  the value of our sales and expenses in that currency converted to us dollars decreases

at december   our cash and investments balance totaled million  of which million is highly liquid 
the remaining investments totaling million are invested in short term certificates of deposit and auction rate securities which were purchased prior to our cash equivalents balance at december  was million 
cash equivalents principally consist of highly liquid money market funds and certificates of deposit with maturities of less than three months when purchased 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the weighted average interest rate of return on cash and investment securities was approximately and less than for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the fair value of cash equivalents and investments held at december  and was million and million  respectively 
based on the average investments outstanding during and  increases or decreases in the rate of return of basis points would result in increases or decreases to interest income of approximately million for both year and  from the reported interest income
