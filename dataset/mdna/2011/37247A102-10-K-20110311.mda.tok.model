the federal and state government programs under which the company generates a majority of its net revenues are subject to legislative and other risk factors that can make it difficult to determine future reimbursement rates for gentiva s services to its patients

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions and select accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the most critical estimates relate to revenue recognition  which incorporates the impact of various revenue adjustments including payment caps under the medicare program for hospice  the collectibility of accounts receivable and related reserves  impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  obligations under insurance programs  including workers compensation  professional liability  property and general liability and employee health and welfare insurance programs  and prior to the carecentrix transaction  the cost of claims incurred but not reported 
a description of the critical accounting policies and a discussion of the significant estimates and judgments associated with such policies are described below 
revenue recognition revenues recognized by the company are subject to a number of elements which impact both the overall amount of revenue realized as well as the timing of the collection of the related accounts receivable 
in each category described below  the impact of the estimate  if applicable  undertaken by the company with respect to these elements is reflected in net revenues in the consolidated statements of income 
see further discussion of the elements below under the heading causes and impact of change on revenue 
in addition  these elements can be impacted by the risk factors described in risks related to our business and industry and risks related to healthcare regulation  which appear in part i  item a of this report 
home health episodic net revenues under the home health prospective payment system pps of reimbursement  for medicare and medicare advantage programs paid at episodic rates  the company estimates net revenues to be recorded based on a reimbursement rate which is determined using relevant data  relating to each patient s health status including clinical condition  functional abilities and service needs  as well as applicable wage indices to give effect to geographic differences in wage levels of employees providing services to the patient 
billings under pps are initially recognized as deferred revenue and are subsequently amortized into revenue over an average patient treatment period 
the process for recognizing revenue to be recorded is based on certain assumptions and judgments  including the average length of time of each treatment as compared to a standard day episode  the differences  if any  between the clinical assessment of and the therapy service needs for each patient at the time of certification as compared to actual experience and the level of adjustments to the fixed reimbursement rate relating to patients who receive a limited number of visits  are discharged but readmitted to another agency within the same day episodic period or are subject to certain other factors during the episode 
deferred revenue of approximately million primarily relating to the pps program was included under current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and january  hospice medicare net revenues medicare revenues for hospice are recorded on an accrual basis based on the number of days a patient has been on service at amounts equal to an estimated payment rate 
the payment rate is dependent on whether a patient is receiving routine home care  general inpatient care  continuous home care or respite care 
adjustments to medicare revenues are recorded based on an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payor or other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
in addition  each hospice provider is subject to certain medicare payments limitations  including an overall payment cap 
the payment cap  which is calculated for each provider by the medicare fiscal intermediary at the end of the hospice cap period  is 
table of contents determined by multiplying the number of first time patient admissions during the cap period by the medicare cap amount  subject to certain adjustments 
medicare revenue paid to a provider during a twelve month period ending october st cannot exceed the aggregate medicare payment cap 
the medicare cap for the cap year ending october  has not been announced by the medicare program 
as of december   the company currently has programs estimated to exceed the medicare cap limits for the cap year and has recorded approximately million for estimated cap exposure as a reduction in medicare revenues in the company s consolidated statement of income for fiscal year as of december   approximately million is reflected as medicare liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheet associated with medicare cap exposures 
fee for service agreements under fee for service agreements with patients and commercial and certain state and local government payers  net revenues are recorded based on net realizable amounts to be received in the period in which the services and products are provided or delivered 
fee for service contracts with commercial payers are traditionally one year in term and renew automatically on an annual basis  unless terminated by either party 
capitated arrangements the company had capitated arrangements with certain managed care customers  particularly in the carecentrix business 
under the capitated arrangements  net revenues are recognized based on a predetermined monthly contractual rate for each member of the managed care plan regardless of the volume of services covered by the capitation arrangements 
net revenues generated under capitated arrangements were approximately percent of total net revenues for fiscal as a result of the disposition of carecentrix  the company s net revenues associated with capitated arrangements were immaterial for fiscal and fiscal medicare settlement issues under interim payment system prior to october   reimbursement of medicare home healthcare services was based on reasonable  allowable costs incurred in providing services to eligible beneficiaries subject to both per visit and per beneficiary limits in accordance with the interim payment system established through the balanced budget act of these costs were reported in annual cost reports which were filed with cms and were subject to audit by the fiscal intermediary engaged by cms 
the fiscal intermediary has not finalized its audit of the fiscal cost reports 
furthermore  settled cost reports relating to certain years prior to fiscal could be subject to reopening of the audit process by the fiscal intermediary 
although management believes that established reserves related to the open fiscal cost report year are sufficient at december   it is possible that adjustments resulting from such audits could exceed established reserves and could have a material effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
these reserves are reflected in medicare liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the company periodically reviews its established audit reserves for appropriateness and records any adjustments or settlements as net revenues in the company s consolidated statements of income 
there have not been any material revisions in established reserves for the periods presented in this filing  except as described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
settlement liabilities are recorded at the time of any probable and reasonably estimable event and any positive settlements are recorded as revenue in the company s consolidated statements of income in the period in which such gain contingencies are realized 
causes and impact of change on revenue for each of the sources of revenue  the principal elements in addition to those described above which can cause change in the amount of revenue to be realized are i an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation  ii an inability to obtain authorizations acceptable to the payer  iii utilization of services at levels other than authorized  and iv other reasons unrelated to credit risk 

table of contents revenue adjustments resulting from differences between estimated and actual reimbursement amounts are recorded as adjustments to net revenues or recorded against allowance for doubtful accounts  depending on the nature of the adjustment 
these are determined by company management and reviewed from time to time  but no less often than quarterly 
each of the elements described here and under each of the various sources of revenue can effect change in the estimates 
although it is not possible to predict the degree of change that might be effected by a variation in one or more of the elements described  the company believes that changes in these elements could cause a change in estimate which could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
there have not been any material revisions in these estimates for the periods presented in this filing 
billing and receivables processing the company s billing systems record revenues at net expected reimbursement based on established or contracted fee schedules 
the systems provide for an initial contractual allowance adjustment from usual and customary charges  which is typical for the payers in the healthcare field 
the company records an initial contractual allowance at the time of billing and reduces the company s revenue to expected reimbursement levels 
changes in contractual allowances  if any  are recorded each month 
changes in the nature of contractual allowances have not been material for the periods presented in this filing 
accounts receivable below further outlines matters considered with respect to estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable collection policy the process for estimating the ultimate collection of receivables involves significant assumptions and judgments 
the company believes that its collection and reserve processes  along with the monitoring of its billing processes  help to reduce the risk associated with material revisions to reserve estimates resulting from adverse changes in reimbursement experience  revenue adjustments and billing functions 
collection processes are performed in accordance with the fair debt collections practices act and include reviewing aging and cash posting reports  contacting the payers to determine why payment has not been made  resubmission of claims when appropriate and filing appeals with payers for claims that have been denied 
collection procedures generally include follow up contact with the payer at least every days from invoice date  and a review of collection activity at days to determine continuation of internal collection activities or potential referral to collection agencies 
the company s bad debt policy includes escalation procedures and guidelines for write off of an account  as well as the authorization required  once it is determined that the open account has been worked by the company s internal collectors and or collection agencies in accordance with the company s standard procedures and resolution of the open account through receipt of payment is determined to be remote 
the company reviews each account individually and does not have either a threshold dollar amount or aging period that it uses to trigger a balance write off  although the company does have a small balance write off policy for non governmental accounts with debit balances under the company s policy is to bill for patient co payments and make good faith efforts to collect such amounts 
at the end of each reporting period  the company estimates the amount of outstanding patient co payments that will not be collected and the amount of outstanding co payments that may be waived due to financial hardship based on a review of historical trends 
this estimate is made as part of the company s evaluation of the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts 
there have not been any material revisions in this estimate for the periods presented in this filing 
accounts receivable reserve methodology the company has implemented a standardized approach to estimate and review the collectibility of its receivables based on accounts receivable aging trends 
the company analyzes historical collection trends  
table of contents reimbursement experience and revenue adjustment trends by major payers including medicare and other payers as well as by business lines  as an integral part of the estimation process related to determining the valuation allowance for accounts receivable 
in addition  the company assesses the current state of its billing functions on a quarterly basis in order to identify any known collection or reimbursement issues to determine the impact  if any  on its reserve estimates  which involve judgment 
revisions in reserve estimates are recorded as an adjustment to the provision for doubtful accounts  which is reflected in selling  general and administrative expenses for continuing operations and in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income 
the provision for doubtful accounts relating to continuing operations and discontinued operations amounted to million and million  respectively  in fiscal  million and million  respectively  in fiscal and million and million  respectively  in fiscal the allowance for doubtful accounts at december   january   and december  was million  million  and million  respectively

the company allocates goodwill to its various operating units 
the company compares the fair value of each operating unit to its carrying amount to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment 
if the fair value of an operating unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the operating unit is less than the carrying value of its goodwill
