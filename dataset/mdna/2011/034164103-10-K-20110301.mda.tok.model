executive overview grain ethanol group the grain ethanol group operates grain elevators in various states  primarily in the us corn belt 
in addition to storage  merchandising and grain trading  the group performs risk management and other services for its customers 
during  the group increased its grain storage capacity by approximately million bushels through business acquisitions and expansion at existing locations 
the group now has over million bushels of storage capacity 
the group is a significant investor in three ethanol facilities located in indiana  michigan and ohio with a nameplate capacity of million gallons 
in addition to its investment in these facilities  the group operates the facilities under management contracts and provides grain origination  ethanol and distillers dried grains ddg marketing and risk management services for which it is separately compensated 
the group is also a significant investor in lansing trade group llc ltg  an established grain merchandising business with operations throughout the country and 
table of contents internationally 
ltg continues to increase its capabilities  including ethanol trading  and is exposed to many of the same risks as the company s grain ethanol group 
this investment provides the group a further opportunity to expand outside of its traditional geographic regions 
the agricultural commodity based business is one in which changes in selling prices generally move in relationship to changes in purchase prices 
therefore  increases or decreases in prices of the agricultural commodities that the company deals in will have a relatively equal impact on sales and cost of sales and a minimal impact on gross profit 
as a result  changes in sales for the period may not necessarily be indicative of the group s overall performance and more focus should be placed on changes to merchandising revenues and service income 
the ethanol industry has been impacted by the rising corn prices during the year caused by global supply and demand 
several existing factors that contribute to greater ethanol production and use are tax credits for blending corn ethanol into gasoline and tariffs that limit the importation of sugar ethanol 
in addition  subsequent to year end  the epa approved an increase in the use of ethanol blends from to for light vehicle models and newer 
as the high demand for corn continues into  the company will continue to monitor the volatility in corn and ethanol prices and its impact on the ethanol llcs closely

railcars and locomotives under management owned  leased or managed for financial institutions in non recourse arrangements at december  were  compared to  at december  the group s average utilization rate railcars and locomotives under management that are in lease service  exclusive of railcars managed for third party investors has decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  however  the group ended the year with an improved utilization rate of 
after registering nearly a drop during all of  rail traffic during all of posted gains of over compared to  but still remains over behind we expect the upward trend to continue as the us and world economies continue their recovery 
although the company has experienced a decline in utilization in its railcar business  due to the nature of these long lived assets low carrying values and year average remaining useful lives  the current economic environment impacting the rail industry would have to persist on a long term basis for the company s railcar assets to be impaired and the company does not believe this will occur 
the company is optimistic about future utilization as the group ended the year with an improved utilization rate of 
the company also continues to evaluate its railcar portfolio to determine if it would be more cost effective to scrap certain cars rather than continue to incur storage costs 
the company is currently  and expects to continue to scrap additional railcars throughout  however  the company does not expect that this will have a significant financial impact to the company s results of operations

the major nutrient products sold by the company principally contain nitrogen  phosphate  potassium and sulfur 
the group saw the continuation of a tight pipeline for most major ingredients through the fourth quarter of due to high demand 
fall application for dry materials along with ammonia was significantly higher due to the early fall harvest  good weather conditions and high grain prices 
it is our belief that the strong fourth quarter volume will have limited downward impact on volume in the first half of we expect to be a good volume year as the demand for nutrients is high and acres planted are expected to increase 
margins should be strong as well as a result of tight supplies of the basic nutrients and strong price trends

see the discussion below on sources and uses of cash for an understanding of the significant decrease in cash from prior year 
borrowings and credit facilities on december   the company entered into a restated loan agreement the agreement with several financial institutions  including us bank national association  acting as agent

table of contents sources and uses of cash operating activities and liquidity the company s operations used cash of million in  a decrease of million from cash provided by operations of million in the significant amount of operating cash flows used in relates primarily to an increase in the commodity prices as noted in the discussion above on working capital 
the company paid income taxes of million in income tax refunds of million were received in the company makes quarterly tax payments based on full year estimated income 
through the first nine months of  the company anticipated significantly higher earnings and was making quarterly income payments accordingly 
in the fourth quarter of  the market price of fertilizer decreased dramatically requiring the company to record lower of cost or market adjustments on its inventory and purchase commitments in the amount of million 
the significantly decreased earnings resulted in lower income taxes due and as of december  the company had over paid its income tax liability for the year 
the majority of this over payment was refunded in the first quarter of investing activities investing activities used million  which is million more than was used in the largest portion of the spending relates to business acquisitions in the amount of million  capital spending of million  and investment in convertible preferred securities of million 
in addition  purchases of railcars in the amount of million nearly offset proceeds from the sale of railcars in the amount of million 
on may   the company acquired two grain cleaning and storage facilities from o malley grain  inc for a purchase price of million 
on december   the company completed the purchase of grain storage facilities in nebraska from b grain  inc for approximately million 
these acquisitions were another step westward for the company and we see it as a great opportunity to be positioned along the high production area of nebraska 
total capital spending for on property  plant and equipment within the company s base business was million  which includes million in the plant nutrient group  million in the grain ethanol group  million in the turf specialty group  million in the retail group  million in the rail group and million in corporate purchases

financing arrangements net cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared to million cash used by financing activities in the company has significant committed short term lines of credit available to finance working capital  primarily inventories  margin calls on commodity contracts and accounts receivable 
as noted above  the company is party to a borrowing arrangement with a syndicate of banks  which was amended in december  to provide the company with million and million in short term lines of credit 
the company had drawn million on its short term line of credit at december  peak borrowing on the line of credit during and was million and million  respectively 
typically  
table of contents the company s highest borrowing occurs in the spring due to seasonal inventory requirements in the fertilizer and retail businesses  credit sales of fertilizer and a customary reduction in grain payables due to the cash needs and market strategies of grain customers 
certain of the company s long term borrowings include covenants that  among other things  impose minimum levels of equity and limitations on additional debt 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants at december  in addition  certain of the company s long term borrowings are collateralized by first mortgages on various facilities or are collateralized by railcar assets 
the company s non recourse long term debt is collateralized by railcar and locomotive assets 
the company paid million in dividends in compared to million in the company paid per common share for the dividends paid in january  per common share for the dividends paid in april  july and october and january  per common share for the dividends paid in april  july and october  and declared a dividend of per common share for the dividends paid in january proceeds from the sale of treasury shares to employees and directors were million and million for and  respectively 
during  the company issued approximately  shares to employees and directors under its share compensation plans 
because the company is a significant consumer of short term debt in peak seasons and the majority of this is variable rate debt  increases in interest rates could have a significant impact on the profitability of the company 
in addition  periods of high grain prices and or unfavorable market conditions could require the company to make additional margin deposits on its exchange traded futures contracts 
conversely  in periods of declining prices  the company receives a return of cash 
the volatility in the capital and credit markets has had a significant impact on the economy in the past few years 
despite the volatile and challenging economic environment  the company has continued to have good access to the credit markets 
in the unlikely event that the company was faced with a situation where it was not able to access the capital markets including through the renewal of its line of credit  the company believes it could successfully implement contingency plans to maintain adequate liquidity such as expanding or contracting the amount of its forward grain contracting  which will reduce the impact of grain price volatility on its daily margin calls 
additionally  the company could begin to liquidate its stored grain inventory as well as execute sales contracts with its customers that align the timing of the receipt of grain from its producers to the shipment of grain to its customers thereby freeing up working capital that is typically utilized to store the grain for extended periods of time 
we also believe that we could raise equity through other portions of the capital market 
the company believes that its operating cash flow  the marketability of its grain inventories  other liquidity contingency plans and its access to sufficient sources of liquidity  will enable it to meet its ongoing funding requirements 
at december   the company had million available under its lines of credit

see the narrative description of business for the grain ethanol group in item of this annual report on form k for further discussion 
e other long term liabilities include estimated obligations under our retiree healthcare programs and the estimated contribution to our defined benefit pension plan 
obligations under the retiree healthcare programs are not fixed commitments and will vary depending on various factors  including the level of participant utilization and inflation 
our estimates of postretirement payments through have considered recent payment trends and actuarial assumptions 
we have not estimated pension contributions beyond due to the significant impact that return on plan assets and changes in discount rates might have on such amounts 
the company had standby letters of credit outstanding of million at december  off balance sheet transactions the company s rail group utilizes leasing arrangements that provide off balance sheet financing for its activities 
the company leases railcars from financial intermediaries through sale leaseback transactions  the majority of which involve operating leasebacks 
railcars owned by the company  or leased by the company from a financial intermediary  are generally leased to a customer under an operating lease 
the company also arranges non recourse lease transactions under which it sells railcars or locomotives to a financial intermediary  and assigns the related operating lease to the financial intermediary on a non recourse basis 
in such arrangements  the company generally provides ongoing railcar maintenance and management services for the financial intermediary  and receives a fee for such services 
on most of the railcars and locomotives  the company holds an option to purchase these assets at the end of the lease

the company prefers non recourse lease transactions  whenever possible  in order to minimize its credit risk 
refer to note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item for more information on the company s leasing activities 
in addition to the railcar counts above  the grain ethanol group owns railcars which it leases to third parties under operating leases 
these cars are included in railcar assets leased to others in the consolidated balance sheets 
critical accounting estimates the process of preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
estimates and assumptions are based on the company s historical experience and management s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances 
actual results  under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed  may change from estimates 
certain of the company s accounting estimates are considered critical  as they are important to the depiction of the company s financial statements and or require significant or complex judgment by management 
there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  however  they are not deemed critical as defined above 
note to the consolidated financial statements in item describes our significant accounting policies which should be read in conjunction with our critical accounting estimates 
the company believes that accounting for allowance for accounts and notes receivable  fair value adjustment for counter party risk  grain inventories and commodity derivative contracts  lower of cost or market inventory adjustments  impairment of long lived assets and equity method investments  income taxes  and employee benefit plans involve significant estimates and assumptions in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for accounts and notes receivable the allowance for doubtful accounts and notes receivable relate to trade receivables and the current portion of notes receivable and is reviewed in detail by the company on a quarterly basis 
the allowance is based 
table of contents both on specific identification of problem accounts and some base level of reserve for small and unidentified issues 
for those customers that are thought to be at higher risk  the company makes assumptions as to collectability based on past history and facts about the current situation 
fair value adjustment for counter party risk the company records quarterly estimated fair value adjustments to its commodity contracts 
these market value adjustments for customer credit exposure are based on internal projections  the compay s historical experience with its producers and customers and the company s knowledge of their business 
in addition  the adjustments to contract fair values tends to fluctuate with the rise and fall of commodity prices 
grain inventories and commodity derivative contracts the company marks to market all grain inventory  forward purchase and sale contracts for grain and ethanol  over the counter grain and ethanol contracts  and exchange traded futures and options contracts 
the overall market for grain inventories is very liquid and active  market value is determined by reference to prices for identical commodities on the cme adjusted primarily for transportation costs  and the company s grain inventories may be sold without significant additional processing 
the company uses forward purchase and sale contracts and both exchange traded and over the counter contracts such as derivatives generally used by the international swap dealers association 
management estimates fair value based on exchange quoted prices  adjusted for differences in local markets  as well as counter party non performance risk in the case of forward and over the counter contracts 
the amount of risk  and therefore the impact to the fair value of the contracts  varies by type of contract and type of counter party 
with the exception of specific customers thought to be at higher risk  the company looks at the contracts in total  segregated by contract type  in its assessment of nonperformance risk 
for those customers that are thought to be at higher risk  the company makes assumptions as to performance based on past history and facts about the current situation 
changes in fair value are recorded as a component of sales and merchandising revenues in the statement of income 
lower of cost or market inventory adjustments the company records its non grain inventory at the lower of cost or market 
whenever changing conditions warrant  the company evaluates the carrying value of its inventory compared to the current market 
market price is determined using both external data  such as current selling prices by third parties and quoted trading prices for the same or similar products  and internal data  such as the company s current ask price and expectations on normal margins 
if the evaluation indicates that the company s inventory is being carried at values higher than the current market can support  the company will write down its inventory to its best estimate of net realizable value 
impairment of long lived assets and equity method investments the company s business segments are each highly capital intensive and require significant investment in facilities and or railcars 
fixed assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
this is done by evaluating the recoverability based on undiscounted projected cash flows  excluding interest and taxes 
if an asset group is considered impaired  the impairment loss to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the asset group s carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
we also annually review the balance of goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter 
these reviews for impairment take into account estimates of future undiscounted  and as appropriate discounted  cash flows 
our estimates of future cash flows are based upon a number of assumptions including lease rates  lease terms  operating costs  life of the assets  potential disposition proceeds  budgets and long range plans 
the majority of our goodwill is in the grain and ethanol and plant nutrient groups 
based on the strength of current performance in both of these groups  we do not anticipate any impairment issues in the near future 
in addition  the company holds investments in limited liability companies that are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
the company reviews its investments to determine whether there has been a decline in the estimated fair value of the investment that is below the company s carrying value which is other than temporary 

table of contents income taxes on a quarterly basis  the income tax provision is based primarily on the expected annual effective tax rate 
in the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item 
our annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may not prevail 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
we have limited reserves for uncertain tax positions and most will be eliminated in the near future as the years available for audit are closing 
employee benefit plans the company provides all full time  non retail employees hired before july  with pension benefits and full time employees hired before january  with postretirement health care benefits 
in order to measure the expense and funded status of these employee benefit plans  management makes several estimates and assumptions  including rates of return on assets set aside to fund these plans  rates of compensation increases  employee turnover rates  anticipated mortality rates and anticipated future healthcare cost trends 
these estimates and assumptions are based on the company s historical experience combined with management s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances 
the selection of the discount rate is not a matter of judgment but based on an index given projected plan payouts 
with the freeze of the pension and supplemental retirement plan  the volatility of the assumption has been reduced 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risk inherent in the company s market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity prices the availability and price of agricultural commodities are subject to wide fluctuations due to unpredictable factors such as weather  plantings  government domestic and foreign farm programs and policies  changes in global demand created by population growth and higher standards of living  and global production of similar and competitive crops 
to reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations in purchase and sale commitments for grain and grain held in inventory  the company enters into exchange traded futures and options contracts that function as economic hedges 
the market value of exchange traded futures and options used for economic hedging has a high  but not perfect correlation  to the underlying market value of grain inventories and related purchase and sale contracts 
the less correlated portion of inventory and purchase and sale contract market value known as basis is much less volatile than the overall market value of exchange traded futures and tends to follow historical patterns 
the company manages this less volatile risk using its daily grain position report to constantly monitor its position relative to the price changes in the market 
in addition  inventory values are affected by the month to month spread relationships in the regulated futures markets  as the company carries inventories over time 
these spread relationships are also less volatile than the overall market value and tend to follow historical patterns but also represent a risk that cannot be directly offset 
the company s accounting policy for its futures and options  as well as the underlying inventory positions and purchase and sale contracts  is to mark them to the market price daily and include gains and losses in the statement of income in sales and merchandising revenues 
a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the company s exposure to market risk of its commodity position exclusive of basis risk 
the company s daily net commodity position consists of 
table of contents inventories  related purchase and sale contracts and exchange traded contracts 
the fair value of the position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures market prices 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in such prices 
the result of this analysis  which may differ from actual results  is as follows december  in thousands net short long position market risk interest rates the fair value of the company s long term debt is estimated using quoted market prices or discounted future cash flows based on the company s current incremental borrowing rates and credit ratings for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
in addition  the company has derivative interest rate contracts recorded in its balance sheet at their fair value 
the fair value of these contracts is estimated based on quoted market termination values 
market risk  which is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one half percent decrease in interest rates  is summarized below december  in thousands fair value of long term debt and interest rate contracts fair value in excess of carrying value market risk
