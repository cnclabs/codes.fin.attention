item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data  the consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto contained in this form k 
please refer to the glossary of terms immediately following the table of contents for a listing and detailed description of the various technical  industry  and other defined terms that are used in this form k 

table of contents business interdigital provides advanced technologies that enable wireless communications 
since our founding in  we have designed and developed a wide range of innovations that are used in digital cellular and wireless products and networks  including g  g  g and ieee related products and networks 
we are a leading contributor of intellectual property to the wireless communications industry and currently hold through wholly owned subsidiaries a portfolio of approximately  us and approximately  us patents related to the fundamental technologies that enable wireless communications 
included in our portfolio are a number of patents and patent applications that we believe are or may be essential or may become essential to cellular and other wireless standards  including g  g  g and the ieee suite of standards 
we believe that companies making  using or selling products based on these standards  which includes all major manufacturers of mobile handsets  require a license under our essential patents and will require licenses under essential patents that may issue from our pending patent applications 
products incorporating our patented inventions include mobile devices  such as cellular phones  tablets  notebook computers and wireless personal digital assistants  wireless infrastructure equipment  such as base stations  and components  dongles and modules for wireless devices 
in  we believe we recognized revenue from over half of all g mobile devices sold worldwide  including those sold by leading mobile communications companies such as apple  htc  lg electronics  research in motion and samsung electronics 
we develop advanced technologies that we expect will improve the wireless user s experience and enable the delivery of a broad array of information and services 
this includes next generation wireless air interfaces and technologies to enhance connectivity and mobility across networks and devices and technologies that support a more efficient transportation of information 
we actively participate in  and contribute our technology solutions to  worldwide organizations responsible for the development and approval of standards to which digital cellular and ieee compliant products and services are built  and our contributions are often incorporated into such standards 
we offer licenses to our patents to equipment producers that manufacture  use and sell digital cellular and ieee related products 
in addition  we offer for license or sale our mobile broadband modem solutions modem ip  know how  and reference platforms to mobile device manufacturers  semiconductor companies  and other equipment producers that manufacture  use and sell digital cellular products 
we have built our suite of technology and patent offerings primarily through internal development  and also through participation in joint development projects with other companies  as well as select acquisitions 
we have assembled a number of leading technology partners that share our vision and complement our internal research and development efforts 
currently  we generate revenues primarily from royalties received under our patent license agreements 
we also generate revenues by licensing our technology solutions and providing related development support 
in   and  our total revenues were million  million  and million  respectively  and our patent licensing revenues were million  million  and million  respectively 
patent licensing revenue made up at least of our total revenues in each period 
in  the amortization of fixed fee royalty payments accounted for approximately of our patent licensing revenues 
these fixed fee revenues are not affected by the related customers success in the market or the general economic climate 
the majority of the remaining portion of our patent licensing revenue is variable in nature due to the per unit structure of the related license agreements 
approximately of this per unit variable portion for related to sales of product by japanese customers for whom the majority of the sales are within japan 
as a result  our per unit variable patent license royalties have been  and will continue to be  largely influenced by sales within the japanese market 
patent license agreements in first quarter  we entered into a worldwide  non exclusive patent license agreement with casio hitachi mobile communications co  ltd 
chmc 
the patent license agreement covers the sale by chmc of all wireless end user terminal devices compliant with g and g cellular standards through june  in  we recognized revenue totaling million  including million related to past sales  in connection with the chmc agreement 
also in  we signed three additional patent license agreements and expanded an existing patent license agreement 
in connection with these agreements  we have received or will be due a total of million 
in 
table of contents addition  in  we entered into a number of non exclusive  non transferrable  royalty bearing patent license agreements in connection with technology transfer agreements 
patent licensing royalties patent license royalties in of million increased from the prior year and represented the most significant portion of our total revenue of million 
this million year over year increase in patent license royalties was primarily driven by increased past sales resulting from the first quarter patent license agreement signed with chmc  the resolution of a routine audit of an existing customer  and the renewal of a patent license agreement in second quarter the above noted patent license agreement signed with chmc in first quarter  the second quarter renewal of a patent license agreement  and an aggregate increase in per unit royalties due to strong sales from our existing customers with concentrations in smartphones further contributed to increases in per unit royalty revenue 
the increase in fixed fee revenue was primarily driven by a full year of revenue from the patent license agreement with samsung signed during first quarter and the third quarter patent license agreement with pantech co  ltd 
pantech 
expiration of the lg license in december  we completed our amortization of million of royalty revenue associated with our patent license agreement with lg 
lg contributed approximately million  or  of our total revenue in this license covered the sale of i terminal units designed to operate in accordance with g and g tdma based and g standards and ii infrastructure designed to operate in accordance with cdma technology and its extensions  up to a limited threshold amount 
under the terms of the agreement  lg paid million in three equal installments from through upon expiration of the agreement  lg received a paid up license to sell single mode gsm gprs edge terminal units under the patents included under the license  and became unlicensed as to all other products covered under the agreement 
we continue to place substantial focus on renewing agreements that have expired or will expire and on expanding our patent customer base  both with the top tier handset manufacturers and other market participants 
nokia united states international trade commission proceeding on november   interdigital filed with the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit a petition for review of certain rulings by the usitc in connection with the usitc investigation initiated by us against nokia in in the appeal  neither the construction of the term synchronize nor the issue of validity can be raised because the usitc took no position on these issues in its determination 
on december   nokia filed a motion to intervene in the appeal  which was granted by the court on january  interdigital s opening brief was filed on april  in its appeal  interdigital seeks reversal of the usitc s claim constructions and non infringement findings with respect to certain claim terms in us patent nos 
 and  vacatur of the usitc s determination of no section violation  and a remand for further proceedings before the usitc 
interdigital is not appealing the usitc s determination of non infringement with respect to us patent nos 
 and  nokia and the usitc filed their briefs on july  in their briefs  nokia and the usitc argue that the usitc correctly construed the claim terms asserted by interdigital in its appeal and that the usitc properly determined that nokia did not infringe the patents on appeal 
nokia also argues that the usitc s finding of noninfringement should be affirmed based on an additional claim term 
nokia further argues that the usitc erred in finding that interdigital could satisfy the domestic industry requirement based solely on its patent licensing activities and without proving that an article in the united states practices the claimed inventions  and that the usitc s finding of no section violation should be affirmed on that additional basis 
interdigital filed its reply brief on august  the court heard oral argument in the appeal on january  the court has not yet issued a decision in the appeal 
interdigital has no obligation as a result of the above matter  and we have not recorded a related liability in our financial statements 
technology solutions in first quarter  we entered into a technology transfer and license agreement with beceem communications inc beceem 
beceem was granted non exclusive  worldwide licenses to certain g and g signal processing technologies to develop  implement  and use in multimode g chips 
in fourth quarter  broadcom 
table of contents corporation broadcom acquired beceem  and upon the closing of such transaction  the technology transfer and license agreement terminated 
beceem paid us the remaining amounts due under an agreement of termination 
in addition  beceem broadcom does not have license to sell products incorporating our technology or to otherwise use our technology  and  upon termination  beceem became obligated to remove fully our technology from all of its products 
as of december   there were no receivable or deferred revenue balances associated with our technology transfer and license agreement with beceem 
in third quarter  we entered into a technology license agreement to provide our slimchip tm g and g modem technology to a mobile chipset manufacturer in mainland china 
under the non exclusive  royalty bearing technology delivery agreement  we licensed our dual mode core with g and g physical layer inclusive of hspa  compliant with the umts gpp release standard and are providing engineering support 
we are receiving milestone based payments under the agreement and will also be entitled to per unit royalties from sales of products containing the delivered technology 
we are accounting for portions of these and other technology solutions agreements using the proportional performance method 
during and  we recognized related revenue of million and million  respectively 
we did not have a deferred revenue balance associated with the above noted technology solutions agreements at december  or december  we had million and million of related unbilled accounts receivable as of december  and december   respectively 
cash and short term investments at december   we had million of cash and short term investments 
a substantial portion of this balance relates to fixed and prepaid royalty payments we have received that relate to future sales of our customers products 
as a result  our cash receipts from existing licenses subject to fixed and prepaid royalties will be reduced in future periods 
we currently plan to preserve a significant portion of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to finance our business in the near future and will continue to periodically review our cash and short term investment position and our dividend policy  including upon the receipt of any new prepaid royalty payments or any new patent license agreements we may sign 
during  we recorded million of cash receipts related to patent licensing and technology solutions agreements as follows in thousands cash in fixed royalty payments current royalties and past sales prepaid royalties technology solutions these cash receipts contributed to a million increase in our cash and short term investments and  together with a million accrual of accounts receivable related to scheduled fixed fee payments  partially offset the million in deferred revenue recognized  resulting in a net million decrease in deferred revenue to million at december  our accounts receivable and deferred revenue balances do not include million of receivables from existing agreements due to us more than twelve months from our current balance sheet date 
approximately million of our million deferred revenue balance relates to fixed royalty payments that are scheduled to amortize as follows in thousands thereafter 
table of contents the remaining million of deferred revenue primarily relates to prepaid royalties that will be recorded as revenue as our customers report their sales of covered products 
based on information provided by the related customers  we expect the prepaid royalty balance will cover sales of related products for several years 
repositioning on march   we announced a repositioning plan that included the expansion of our technology development and licensing business  the cessation of further asic development of our slimchip modem and efforts to monetize the slimchip technology investment through ip licensing and technology sales 
in connection with the repositioning  the company incurred a charge of million during of the total charge of million  approximately million represents long lived asset impairments for assets used in the product and product development  including million of acquired intangible assets and million of property  equipment  and other assets 
in addition  the repositioning resulted in a reduction in force of approximately employees  the majority of which were terminated effective april  approximately million of the total repositioning charge represented cash obligations associated with severance and contract termination costs  all of which have been satisfied as of december  we did not incur any additional repositioning charges during  nor do we expect to incur any related costs in the future 
repurchase of common stock in october  our board of directors authorized a million share repurchase program the repurchase program 
in march  our board of directors authorized another million share repurchase program the repurchase program  pursuant to which the company may repurchase shares through open market purchases  pre arranged trading plans  or privately negotiated purchases 
during  we completed the repurchase program  under which we repurchased a cumulative total of million shares for million  including million shares we repurchased for million in during  we repurchased approximately million shares for million under the repurchase program 
there were no repurchases of common stock during from january  through february   no repurchases were made under the repurchase program 
intellectual property rights enforcement from time to time  if we believe any party is required to license our patents in order to manufacture and sell certain digital cellular products and such party has not done so  we may institute legal action against them 
this legal action typically takes the form of a patent infringement lawsuit or an administrative proceeding such as a section proceeding before the usitc 
in addition  we and our customers  in the normal course of business  might seek to resolve disagreements between the parties with respect to the rights and obligations of the parties under the applicable license agreement through arbitration or litigation 
in  our intellectual property enforcement costs decreased to million from million and million in and  respectively 
this represented of our total patent administration and licensing costs of million 
intellectual property enforcement costs will vary depending upon activity levels  and it is likely they will continue to be a significant expense for us in the future 

table of contents comparability of financial results when comparing financial results against other periods  the following items should be taken into consideration our revenue included million of royalties related to past sales recognized in connection with new patent license agreements and the resolution of an audit of one of our existing customers 
our operating expense included a million charge to increase our long term compensation program ltcp accrual from to for the incentive period january  through december  critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of accounting principles  generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in both our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from these estimates and any such differences may be material to the financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements and are included in item of part ii of this form k 
we believe the accounting policies that are of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and that may involve a higher degree of complexity and judgment in their application compared to others are those relating to revenue recognition  compensation  and income taxes 
if different assumptions were made or different conditions existed  our financial results could have been materially different 
revenue recognition we derive the vast majority of our revenue from patent licensing 
the timing and amount of revenue recognized from each customer depends upon a variety of factors  including the specific terms of each agreement and the nature of the deliverables and obligations 
such agreements are often complex and include multiple elements 
these agreements can include  without limitation  elements related to the settlement of past patent infringement liabilities  up front and non refundable license fees for the use of patents and or know how  patent and or know how licensing royalties on covered products sold by customers  cross licensing terms between us and other parties  the compensation structure and ownership of intellectual property rights associated with contractual technology development arrangements  advanced payments and fees for service arrangements  and settlement of intellectual property enforcement 
due to the inherent difficulty in establishing reliable  verifiable  and objectively determinable evidence of the fair value of the separate elements of these agreements  the total revenue resulting from such agreements may often be recognized over the performance period 
in other circumstances  such as those agreements involving consideration for past and expected future patent royalty obligations  after consideration of the particular facts and circumstances  the appropriate recording of revenue between periods may require the use of judgment 
in all cases  revenue is only recognized after all of the following criteria are met written agreements have been executed  delivery of technology or intellectual property rights has occurred or services have been rendered  fees are fixed or determinable  and collectability of fees is reasonably assured 
we establish a receivable for payments expected to be received within twelve months from the balance sheet date based on the terms in the license 
our reporting of such payments often results in an increase to both accounts receivable and deferred revenue 
deferred revenue associated with fixed fee royalty payments is classified on the balance sheet as short term when it is scheduled to be amortized within twelve months from the balance sheet date 
all other deferred revenue is classified as long term  as amounts to be recognized over the next twelve months are not known 
patent license agreements upon signing a patent license agreement  we provide the customer permission to use our patented inventions in specific applications 
we account for patent license agreements in accordance with the guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables and the guidance for revenue recognition 
we have elected to utilize the 
table of contents leased based model for revenue recognition  with revenue being recognized over the expected period of benefit to the customer 
under our patent license agreements  we typically receive one or a combination of the following forms of payment as consideration for permitting our customers to use our patented inventions in their applications and products consideration for past sales consideration related to a customer s product sales from prior periods may result from a negotiated agreement with a customer that utilized our patented inventions prior to signing a patent license agreement with us or from the resolution of a disagreement or arbitration with a customer over the specific terms of an existing license agreement 
we may also receive consideration for past sales in connection with the settlement of patent litigation where there was no prior patent license agreement 
in each of these cases  we record the consideration as revenue when we have obtained a signed agreement  identified a fixed or determinable price  and determined that collectability is reasonably assured 
fixed fee royalty payments these are up front  non refundable royalty payments that fulfill the customer s obligations to us under a patent license agreement for a specified time period or for the term of the agreement for specified products  under certain patents or patent claims  for sales in certain countries  or a combination thereof in each case for a specified time period including for the life of the patents licensed under the agreement 
we recognize revenues related to fixed fee royalty payments on a straight line basis over the effective term of the license 
we utilize the straight line method because we cannot reliably predict in which periods  within the term of a license  the customer will benefit from the use of our patented inventions 
prepayments these are up front  non refundable royalty payments towards a customer s future obligations to us related to its expected sales of covered products in future periods 
our customers obligations to pay royalties typically extend beyond the exhaustion of their prepayment balance 
once a customer exhausts its prepayment balance  we may provide them with the opportunity to make another prepayment toward future sales or it will be required to make current royalty payments 
current royalty payments these are royalty payments covering a customer s obligations to us related to its sales of covered products in the current contractual reporting period 
customers that either owe us current royalty payments or have prepayment balances are obligated to provide us with quarterly or semi annual royalty reports that summarize their sales of covered products and their related royalty obligations to us 
we typically receive these royalty reports subsequent to the period in which our customers underlying sales occurred 
as a result  it is impractical for us to recognize revenue in the period in which the underlying sales occur  and  in most cases  we recognize revenue in the period in which the royalty report is received and other revenue recognition criteria are met due to the fact that without royalty reports from our customers  our visibility into our customers sales is very limited 
the exhaustion of prepayments and current royalty payments are often calculated based on related per unit sales of covered products 
from time to time  customers will not report revenues in the proper period  most often due to legal disputes 
when this occurs  the timing and comparability of royalty revenue could be affected 
in cases where we receive objective  verifiable evidence that a customer has discontinued sales of products covered under a patent license agreement with us  we recognize any related deferred revenue balance in the period that we receive such evidence 
technology solutions revenue technology solutions revenue consists primarily of revenue from software licenses and engineering services 
software license revenues are recognized in accordance with the original and revised guidance for software revenue recognition 
when the arrangement with a customer includes significant production  modification  or customization of the software  we recognize the related revenue using the percentage of completion method in accordance with the accounting guidance for construction type and certain production type contracts 
under this method  revenue and profit are recognized throughout the term of the contract  based on actual labor costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated labor costs related to the contract 
changes in estimates for revenues  costs  and profits are recognized in the period in which they are determinable 
when such estimates indicate that costs will exceed future revenues and a loss on the contract exists  a provision for the entire loss is recognized at that time 

table of contents we recognize revenues associated with engineering service arrangements that are outside the scope of the accounting guidance for construction type and certain production type contracts on a straight line basis  unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned in a different pattern  over the contractual term of the arrangement or the expected period during which those specified services will be performed  whichever is longer 
in such cases we often recognize revenue using proportional performance and measure the progress of our performance based on the relationship between incurred labor hours and total estimated labor hours or other measures of progress  if available 
our most significant cost has been labor and we believe both labor hours and labor cost provide a measure of the progress of our services 
the effect of changes to total estimated contract costs is recognized in the period such changes are determined 
when technology solutions agreements include royalty payments  we recognize revenue from the royalty payments using the same methods described above under our policy for recognizing revenue from patent license agreements 
compensation programs we use a variety of compensation programs to both attract and retain employees and more closely align employee compensation with company performance 
these programs include  but are not limited to  short term incentive awards tied to performance goals and cash awards to inventors for filed patent applications and patent issuances  as well as  prior to  restricted stock unit rsu awards for non managers and the ltcp for managers  which included both time based and performance based rsus and a performance based cash incentive component 
prior to  the ltcp was designed to alternate between rsu and cash cycles  each of which generally covered a three year period and could overlap with another cycle by as many as two years 
in fourth quarter  the ltcp was amended to  among other things  increase the relative proportion of performance based compensation for executives and managers  extend participation to all employees  and eliminate alternating rsu and cash cycles 
effective with the cycle that began on january   executives and managers will receive of their ltcp participation in the form of time based rsus that vest in full at the end of the three year cycle and the remaining in the form of performance based awards granted under the long term incentive plan ltip component of the ltcp 
all other employees will receive of their ltcp participation in the form of time based rsus that vest in full at the end of the three year cycle 
the ltip performance based awards that are applicable to executives and managers may be paid out at the end of the three year cycle in the form of cash or equity or any combination thereof  as determined by the compensation committee of the board of directors 
where the allocation has not been determined at the beginning of the cycle  as in the case of cycle defined below  the allocation is assumed to be cash for accounting purposes 
the following ltcp cycles were active for all or some portion of the three years ended december  cash cycle a a long term performance based cash incentive covering the period july  through december   rsu cycle time based and performance based rsus granted on january   which vested on or before january   cash cycle a long term performance based cash incentive covering the period january  through december   rsu cycle time based and performance based rsus granted on january   which vest on or before january   and cycle time based rsus granted on november   which vest on january   and a long term performance based incentive covering the period from january  through december  we recognized share based compensation expense of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the majority of the share based compensation expense  for all years  related to rsu awards granted under our ltcp 
we also recognized million  million  and million of compensation expense in   and  respectively  related to the performance based cash incentive under our ltcp 
the amount includes a charge of million to increase the accrual rate for cash cycle of our ltcp from the previously estimated payout of to the actual payout of 
the increase in the incentive payout from 
table of contents to was driven by the company s success in achieving a number of key goals  including the signing of five new or amended g patent license agreements after we reduced the accrual rate to in third quarter collectively  these new or amended g patent license agreements have generated million in cash or receivables and are expected to continue to provide additional per unit royalties in future periods 
the amount includes a credit of million to reduce the accrual rate for cash cycle from to based on revised expectations for a lower payout 
this million adjustment related to the reduction of our accrual established in the prior year 
the amount includes a fourth quarter charge of million to increase our accrual for cash cycle a from the previously estimated payout of to the actual payout of 
the increase in the incentive payout was driven by the company s success in achieving a number of key goals  including signing lg and samsung  two of the top five cellular handset oems at the time  to g licensing agreements 
these licenses helped increase our share of the g market under license from approximately to approximately  and drove substantial positive operating cash flow over the period 
at december   accrued compensation expense associated with the ltcp s performance based incentives was based on an actual payout of for cash cycle and an estimated payout of for cycle under both the prior and revised versions of the program  achievement of the goals set by the compensation committee of the board of directors results in a payout of the performance based incentive target amounts 
for each change above or below achievement  the payout is adjusted by percentage points with a maximum payout under the revised program of  a maximum payout of under the prior program and no payout under either program for performance that falls below achievement 
the following table provides examples of the performance based incentive payout that would be earned based on various levels of goal achievement goal achievement payout less than or greater revised program maximum or greater old program maximum if we had assumed that goal achievement for cycle would be either or  we would have accrued either million more or less  respectively  of related compensation expense through december  for ltcp rsu cycles that began prior to  executives received of their rsu grant as performance based rsus and as time based rsus  and the company s managers received of their rsu grant as performance based rsus and as time based rsus 
under the prior program  achievement of the goals set by the compensation committee of the board of directors results in a payout of the performance based rsu incentive target amounts 
for each change above or below achievement  the rsu payout is adjusted by percentage points with a maximum payout of 
for performance that falls below achievement  no share payout would occur 
the following table provides examples of the performance based rsu payout that would be earned based on various levels of goal achievement goal achievement payout less than or greater 
table of contents at december   we did not meet the criteria specified by the accounting guidance for stock based compensation to accrue performance based equity compensation associated with the rsu cycle grants 
if we had met the criteria with goal achievement  we would have accrued million of related compensation expense through december  we will establish an accrual for the performance based rsus under rsu cycle in the future if our future assessment of the expected attainment against pre established performance goals meets certain criteria for performance based share compensation 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statement of income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if management has determined that it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
we are subject to examinations by the internal revenue service irs and other taxing jurisdictions on various tax matters  including challenges to various positions we assert in our filings 
in the event that the irs or another taxing jurisdiction levies an assessment in the future  it is possible the assessment could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
the financial statement recognition of the benefit for a tax position is dependent upon the benefit being more likely than not to be sustainable upon audit by the applicable tax authority 
if this threshold is met  the tax benefit is then measured and recognized at the largest amount that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
in the event that the irs or another taxing jurisdiction levies an assessment in the future  it is possible the assessment could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
during fourth quarter  we completed a study to assess the company s ability to utilize foreign tax credit carryovers into the tax year as a result of the study  we have amended our united states federal income tax returns for the periods to reclaim the foreign tax payments we made during those periods from deductions to foreign tax credits 
we have established a basis to support amending the returns and estimate that the maximum incremental benefit will be approximately million 
we recorded a net benefit of million after establishing a million reserve for related tax contingencies 
the process to finalize our utilization of these credits is complicated  involving tax treaty proceedings including both us and foreign tax jurisdictions 
it is possible that at the conclusion of this process the million benefit we recognized may not be realized in full or in part or that we may realize the maximum benefit of million 
between and  we paid approximately million in foreign taxes for which we have claimed foreign tax credits against our us tax obligations 
it is possible that as a result of tax treaty procedures  the us government may reach an agreement with the related foreign governments that will result in a partial refund of foreign taxes paid with a related reduction in our foreign tax credits 
due to both foreign currency fluctuations and differences in the interest rate charged by the us government compared to the interest rates  if any  used by the foreign governments  any such agreement could result in interest expense and or foreign currency gain or loss 
new accounting guidance accounting standards updates revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb finalized revenue recognition guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
by providing another alternative for determining the selling price of deliverables  the accounting standard update related to revenue arrangements with multiple 
table of contents deliverables will allow companies to allocate arrangement consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements in a manner that better reflects the transaction s economics 
in addition  the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration is no longer permitted under this new guidance 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  we adopted this guidance effective january   and will apply this guidance on a prospective basis beginning with all new or materially modified revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables entered into on or after january  as a result of this new guidance  we will recognize revenue from new or materially modified agreements with multiple elements and fixed payments earlier than we would have under our old policy 
accounting standards updates fair value measurements in january  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this guidance requires new disclosures about transfers in and out of level and measurements and separate disclosures about activity relating to level measurements 
in addition  this guidance clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation and the input and valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the guidance only relates to disclosure and does not impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company adopted this guidance in first quarter there was no significant impact to the company s disclosures upon adoption  as the company does not have any such transfers 
legal proceedings we are routinely involved in disputes associated with enforcement and licensing activities regarding our intellectual property  including litigations and other proceedings 
these litigations and other proceedings are important means to enforce our intellectual property rights 
we are a party to other disputes and legal actions not related to our intellectual property  but also arising in the ordinary course of our business 
refer to item of part i of this form k for a complete description of our material legal proceedings 
financial position  liquidity  and capital requirements our primary sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  as well as cash generated from operations 
we have the ability to obtain additional liquidity through debt and equity financings 
based on our past performance and current expectations  we believe our available sources of funds  including cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and cash generated from our operations  will be sufficient to finance our operations  capital requirements  our existing stock repurchase and dividend programs and any stock repurchase program that we may initiate in the next twelve months 
however  the market for intellectual property rights is competitive and some opportunities to acquire intellectual property rights may require additional financing 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  and december   we had the following amounts of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in thousands december  increase decrease cash and cash equivalents short term investments total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased million in the increase was primarily due to our receipts of the third and fourth of four million installments from samsung under our patent license agreement signed in january after using these and other receipts to fund our operations and working capital requirements in  we invested the excess in short term investments 

table of contents cash provided by operating activities we generated the following cash flows from our operating activities in and in thousands for the year ended december  decrease increase cash provided by operating activities the positive operating cash flow in arose principally from receipts of approximately million related to patent licensing and technology solutions agreements 
these receipts included the third and fourth of four million installments from samsung under our january license agreement 
we also received million of fixed fee payments and million of per unit royalty payments  including past sales and prepayments  from other existing and new customers 
cash receipts from our technology solutions agreements totaled million  primarily related to royalties and other license fees associated with our slimchip modem core 
these receipts were partially offset by cash operating expenses operating expenses less depreciation of fixed assets  amortization of intangible assets  and non cash compensation of million  cash payments for foreign source withholding taxes of million primarily related to the samsung installments  and estimated federal tax payments of million 
the positive operating cash flow in arose principally from receipts of approximately million related to patent licensing and technology solutions agreements 
these receipts included the first two of four installments of million from samsung under our january license agreement 
we also received prepayments of million from two existing customers  per unit royalty payments of million from other existing or new customers  other fixed fee payments of million  and cash receipts from our technology solutions customers totaling million  primarily related to royalties associated with our slimchip modem ip 
these receipts  along with a million increase in net working capital  were partially offset by cash operating expenses operating expenses less depreciation of fixed assets  amortization of intangible assets  non cash repositioning charges  and non cash compensation of million  cash payments for foreign source withholding taxes of million primarily related to samsung and pantech cash receipts  an estimated federal tax payment of million  and a million payment on long term cash incentive plans 
working capital we believe that working capital  adjusted to exclude cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  current maturities of debt  and current deferred revenue provides additional information about non cash assets and liabilities that might affect our near term liquidity

these decreases in deferred revenue were partially offset by gross increases in deferred revenue of million  primarily related to patent license agreements and new technology solutions agreements signed in based on current license agreements  we expect the amortization of fixed fee royalty payments to reduce the december  deferred revenue balance of million by million over the next twelve months 
additional reductions to deferred revenue will be dependent upon the level of per unit royalties our customers report against prepaid balances 
at december  and december   we had approximately million and million options outstanding  respectively  that had exercise prices less than the fair market value of our stock at each balance sheet date

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash equivalents and investments the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal and maintain liquidity while at the same time capturing a market rate of return 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain our portfolio of cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including government obligations  corporate bonds  and commercial paper 
interest rate risk we invest our cash in a number of diversified high quality investment grade fixed and floating rate securities with a fair value of million at december  our exposure to interest rate risks is not significant due to the short average maturity  quality  and diversification of our holdings 
we do not hold any derivative  derivative commodity instruments or other similar financial instruments in our portfolio 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is generally limited to our investment portfolio 
we believe that a hypothetical change in period end interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations or cash flows 
the following table provides information about our interest bearing securities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  the table presents principal cash flows  weighted average yield at cost and contractual maturity dates 
additionally  we have assumed that these securities are similar enough within the specified categories to aggregate these securities for presentation purposes

bank liquidity risk as of december   we had approximately million in operating accounts and money market funds that are held with domestic and international financial institutions 
the majority of these balances are held with domestic financial institutions 
while we monitor daily cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate  these cash balances could be lost or become inaccessible if the underlying financial institutions fail or if they are unable to meet the liquidity requirements of their depositors 
notwithstanding  we have not incurred any losses and have had full access to our operating accounts to date 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to risk from fluctuations in currencies  which might change over time as our business practices evolve  that could impact our operating results  liquidity and financial condition

investment risk we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our short term and long term investments in addition to the liquidity and creditworthiness of the underlying issuers of our investments 
we place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
this policy also limits our amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of instrument 
given that the guidelines of our investment policy prohibit us from investing in anything but highly rated instruments  our investments are not subject to significant fluctuations in fair value due to the volatility of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates for such securities
