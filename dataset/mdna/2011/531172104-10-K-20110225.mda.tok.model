the company also has an ownership interest through unconsolidated joint ventures in acres of developable land  substantially all of which is zoned for commercial use 
the company focuses on creating value for shareholders and increasing profitability and cash flow 
with respect to its properties in operation  the company endeavors to maintain high occupancy levels while increasing rental rates and controlling costs 
the company pursues development opportunities that it believes will create value and yield acceptable returns 
the company also acquires properties that it believes will create long term value  and disposes of properties that no longer fit within the company s strategic objectives or in situations where it can optimize cash proceeds 
the company s operating results depend primarily upon income from rental operations and are substantially influenced by rental demand for the properties in operation 
the recent economic disruption continues to adversely impact the company s business 
uncertainty about the pricing of commercial real estate as a general matter has reduced the company s ability to acquire real estate and to dispose of properties that are not consistent with our long term strategy 
similarly  although some signs of economic recovery have been noted  market conditions have not normalized 
we will however be opportunistic in both our acquisition and disposition activity and anticipate taking advantage of opportunities as they arise 
although we have seen some improvement in the general economy  the economy as it impacts our business has not returned to pre recession levels 
rental demand for the properties in operation was flat for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  despite this trend  the company successfully leased million square feet during the year ended december  and attained occupancy of for the wholly owned properties in operation and for the jv properties in operation for a combined occupancy of for the properties in operation as of that date

the company believes that average occupancy for its properties in operation will be flat or increase by up to for compared to the company believes the occupancy for industrial distribution properties will increase by to and this increase will be partially offset by decreases in occupancy of up to for industrial flex and office properties 
furthermore  the company believes that straight line rents on renewal and replacement leases for will on average be to lower than rents on expiring leases 
the company is currently distributing more in dividends than it receives in net cash provided by operating activities less customary tenant improvement and leasing transaction costs 
over time  increases in occupancy and rental rates could offset this shortfall 
should market opportunities allow the company to accelerate its strategy relating to dispositions ie sale of suburban office without corresponding opportunities to reinvest those proceeds in the near term  this shortfall would increase 
the company will continually evaluate these circumstances opposite its distribution policies

the forbearance agreement provides for the deferral of the tenant s monthly obligation of  for the period from december  through june  the company has reviewed its situation with this tenant and based upon this review and the review of its other tenants  provisions are established  and an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its tenants to make required rental payments is maintained 
as of december  and  the company s allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million and million  respectively 
the company s bad debt expense for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
impairment of real estate the company evaluates its real estate investments upon the occurrence of significant adverse changes in operations to assess whether any impairment indicators are present that could affect the recovery of the recorded value 
indicators the company uses to determine whether an impairment evaluation is necessary include the low occupancy level of the property  holding period for the property  strategic decisions regarding future development plans for a property under development and land held for development and other market factors 
if impairment indicators are present  the company performs an undiscounted cash flow analysis and compares the net carrying amount of the property to the property s estimated undiscounted future cash flow over the anticipated holding period 
the company assesses the expected undiscounted cash flows based upon estimated capitalization rates  historic operating results and market conditions that may affect the property 
if any real estate investment is considered impaired  the carrying value of the property is written down to its estimated fair value 
fair value is estimated based on the discounting of future expected cash flows at a risk adjusted interest rate 
during the years ended december   and  the company recognized impairment losses of million  million and million  respectively 
the determination of whether an impairment exists requires the company to make estimates  judgments and assumptions about the future cash flows 
the company has evaluated each of its properties and land held for development and has determined that there are no additional impairment charges that need to be recorded at december  intangibles in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  business combinations  the company allocates the purchase price of real estate acquired to land  building and improvements and intangibles based on the relative fair value of each component 
the value ascribed to in place leases is based on the rental rates for the existing leases compared to the company s estimate of the fair market lease rates for leases of similar terms and present valuing the difference based on an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired 
origination values are also assigned to in place leases  and  where appropriate  value is assigned to customer relationships

additionally  the company estimates carrying costs during the expected lease up periods including real estate taxes  other operating expenses and lost rentals at contractual rates 
the company depreciates the amounts allocated to building and improvements over years 
the amounts allocated to the intangible relating to in place leases  which are included in deferred financing and leasing costs or in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  are amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the related leases

investments in unconsolidated joint ventures the company analyzes its investments in joint ventures under fasb asc  consolidation  to determine if the joint venture is considered a variable interest entity and would require consolidation 
the company does not have any interests in variable interest entities 
the company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures using the equity method of accounting as the company exercises significant influence over  but does not control  these entities 
these investments are recorded initially at cost  as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions 
on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the company s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired 
an investment is impaired only if management s estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment  and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment 

table of contents management estimated the fair value of its ownership interest in the joint ventures considering the estimated fair value of the real estate assets owned by the joint ventures and the related indebtedness as well as the working capital assets and liabilities of the joint ventures and the terms of the related joint venture agreements 
the company s estimates of fair value of the real estate assets are based on a discounted cash flow analysis incorporating a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including  among others  demand for space  competition for tenants  current market rental rates  changes in market rental rates  operating costs  capitalization rates  holding periods and discount rates 
for these assumptions  the company considered its experience and historical performance in the various markets and data provided by market research organizations 
in assessing whether the impairment is other than temporary the company considers several factors 
the longevity and severity of the impairment are considered as well as the expected time for recovery of value to occur  if ever 
the company developed the budgets for its unconsolidated joint ventures during the fourth quarter of for certain of the unconsolidated joint ventures  the budgets suggested a continuing situation of weak demand for space and intense competition for tenants leading to another year of stagnant rents 
this continuing and sustained impairment in value as suggested by the budgets and the other assessment considerations described above caused the company to conclude that the decline in value was other than temporary for four of the company s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 
with respect to impairment losses recognized during the year ended december   the company s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures as of december  before and after the impairment charge are as follows in thousands december  before after impairment impairment impairment liberty venture i  lp kings hill unit trust liberty illinois  lp liberty aipo lp silversword properties  ltd

it compares the results of operations of the company for the year ended december  with the results of operations of the company for the year ended december   and the results of operations of the company for the year ended december  with the results of operations of the company for the year ended december  as a result of the varying level of development  acquisition and disposition activities by the company in  and  the overall operating results of the company during such periods are not directly comparable

total operating revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this million increase was primarily due to the increase in investment in operating real estate 
this increase was also due to an increase in termination fees  which totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  these increases were partially offset by decreases in revenues for the same store properties because of decreases in rental rates and decreases in occupancy for the industrial flex and office properties
