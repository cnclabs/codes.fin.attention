item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations crude oil and natural gas hedging of this report and the discussion and tables in notes to consolidated financial statements note derivative instruments appearing later in this report 
on july   president obama signed into law the dodd frank act  which  among other things  establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over the counter derivatives market and the entities that participate in that market 
significant regulations are required to be promulgated by the sec and the commodity futures trading commission within days from the date of enactment to implement the new legislation 
the new legislation  to the extent applicable to the company or its derivatives counterparties  may result in increased costs and cash collateral requirements for the types of derivative instruments the company uses to hedge and otherwise manage its financial and commercial risks related to fluctuations in commodity prices  and could have an adverse effect on the company s ability to hedge risks associated with its business 
many of the key concepts and processes under the dodd frank act are not defined and must be delineated by rules and regulations which have been and are being adopted by the applicable regulatory agencies 
as a consequence  it is not possible at this time to predict the effects that the dodd frank act or the resulting rules and regulations may have on the company s hedging activities 
credit risk 
we monitor our risk of loss due to non performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations 
our principal exposure to credit risk is through the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production  which we market to energy marketing companies  refineries and affiliates million in receivables at december   our joint interest receivables million at december   and counterparty credit risk associated with our derivative instrument receivables million at december  
we monitor our exposure to counterparties on crude oil and natural gas sales primarily by reviewing credit ratings  financial statements and payment history 
we extend credit terms based on our evaluation of each counterparty s credit worthiness 
we have not generally required our counterparties to provide collateral to support crude oil and natural gas sales receivables owed to us 
historically  our credit losses on crude oil and natural gas sales receivables have been immaterial 
joint interest receivables arise from billing entities who own a partial interest in the wells we operate 
these entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we wish to drill 
we can do very little to choose who participates in our wells 
in order to minimize our exposure to credit risk we often request prepayment of drilling costs where it is allowed by contract or state law 
for such prepayments  a liability is recorded and subsequently reduced as the associated work is performed 
this liability was million as of december   which will be used to offset future capital costs when billed 
in this manner  we reduce credit risk 
we also have the right to place a lien on our co owners interest in the well to redirect production proceeds in order to secure payment or  if necessary  foreclose on the interest 
historically  our credit losses on joint interest receivables have been immaterial 
our use of derivative instruments involves the risk that our counterparties will be unable to meet their commitments under the arrangements 
we manage this risk by using multiple counterparties who we consider to be financially strong in order to minimize our exposure to credit risk with any individual counterparty 
currently  all of our derivative contracts are with parties that are lenders or affiliates of lenders under our revolving credit agreement 

table of contents interest rate risk 
our exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to variable rate borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
we manage our interest rate exposure by monitoring both the effects of market changes in interest rates and the proportion of our debt portfolio that is variable rate versus fixed rate debt 
we may utilize interest rate derivatives to alter interest rate exposure in an attempt to reduce interest rate expense related to existing debt issues 
interest rate derivatives may be used solely to modify interest rate exposure and not to modify the overall leverage of the debt portfolio 
we currently have no interest rate derivatives 
we had million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility at february  the impact of a increase in interest rates on this amount of debt would result in increased interest expense of approximately million per year and a million decrease in net income per year 
our revolving credit facility matures on july  and the weighted average interest rate at february  was 
the following table presents our long term debt maturities and the weighted average interest rates by expected maturity date as of december  in millions thereafter total fixed rate debt notes principal amount weighted average interest rate variable rate debt revolving credit facility principal amount weighted average interest rate this amount does not reflect the discounts at which the notes were issued 
changes in interest rates affect the amount we pay on borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
all of our other long term indebtedness is fixed rate and does not expose us to the risk of cash flow loss due to changes in market interest rates 
however  changes in interest rates do affect the fair value of our notes
