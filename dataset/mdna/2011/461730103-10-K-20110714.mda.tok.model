item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information is provided in connection with  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we operate on a fiscal year ending on april the following discussion and analysis is for the fiscal year ended april  overview we are a self advised equity real estate investment trust engaged in owning and operating income producing real properties 
our investments include multi family residential properties and commercial properties located primarily in the upper midwest states of minnesota and north dakota 
our properties are diversified in property type and location 
as of april   our real estate portfolio consisted of multi family residential properties containing  apartment units and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of million  and commercial properties containing approximately million square feet of leasable space and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of billion 
our commercial properties consist of commercial office properties containing approximately million square feet of leasable space and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of million  
index annual report commercial medical properties including senior housing containing approximately million square feet of leasable space and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of million  commercial industrial properties containing approximately million square feet of leasable space and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of million  and commercial retail properties containing approximately million square feet of leasable space and having a total real estate investment amount net of accumulated depreciation of million 
our primary source of income and cash is rents associated with multi family residential and commercial leases 
our business objective is to increase shareholder value by employing a disciplined investment strategy 
this strategy is focused on growing assets in desired geographical markets  achieving diversification by property type and location  and adhering to targeted returns in acquiring properties 
total revenues of iret properties  our operating partnership  increased by million to million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year this increase was primarily attributable to the addition of new real estate properties 
we estimate that rent concessions offered to tenants during the twelve months ended april  lowered our operating revenues by approximately million  compared to million for fiscal year expenses increased during fiscal year  with utilities  maintenance  real estate taxes  and property management expense all increasing from year earlier levels 
on an all property basis  physical occupancy levels in our total commercial property segments decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year physical occupancy rates in our commercial medical segment increased  physical occupancy in our commercial office  commercial industrial and commercial retail segments decreased 
physical occupancy in our multi family residential segment increased to in fiscal year on an all property basis  from in fiscal year as our physical occupancy levels demonstrate  we continued to experience a challenging market environment in our commercial office  industrial and retail segments 
while many of our markets appear to be emerging from recession  growth remains sluggish and unemployment high  and we continue to find it challenging to lease vacant space 
we expect these leasing challenges to continue during fiscal year  with correspondingly flat or modest growth in rental revenues and net operating income 
our commercial medical segment continued to show strengthening results  and remains the best performing segment in our overall commercial portfolio  with strong real estate revenue and net operating income results 
our multi family residential properties have shown steady improvement in occupancy and real estate revenue over the past several quarters 
we believe we are seeing positive results from our internal property management initiative  in terms of our ability to focus on increasing net operating income by improving occupancy  maintaining control of expenses and establishing direct relationships with our residents 
in some markets we are experiencing sufficient improvement in market fundamentals ie  a better balance of supply of available units with demand for those units to permit us to raise rents 
while we expect to see continued favorable results in our multi family segment in fiscal year  our ability to maintain occupancy levels and selectively raise rents is dependent on continued economic recovery and employment growth  and the strength and sustainability of a recovery is currently still uncertain 
while we plan to actively pursue property acquisitions and development projects throughout fiscal year  which may provide future revenue and net operating income growth  in our experience potential acquisitions are fully priced  based on their current income  and accordingly we continue to find it challenging to identify in our markets accretive acquisitions that are attractively priced 
during fiscal year  our financing and refinancing efforts continued to make a solid contribution to our net income 
our mortgage interest expense decreased approximately over the year earlier period  which translated into a reduction of approximately million in mortgage interest expense 
our overall weighted average interest rate on all outstanding mortgage debt excluding our multi bank line of credit and new loans for our jamestown mall and trinity hospital build to suit development projects  which are financed with recovery zone facility revenue bonds was as of april   compared to as of april  in fiscal year  we expect that capital accessed through cash out refinancings of existing mortgage debt will be at lower levels than in 
index annual report fiscal year  due to fewer mortgage loans scheduled for refinancing 
we continue to expect  however  based on recent experience  that we will be able successfully to refinance  on terms comparable to existing financings  those mortgage loans that are scheduled for refinancing 
additional information and more detailed discussions of our fiscal year operating results are found in the following sections of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
real estate 
real estate is carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation  less an adjustment for impairment  if any 
depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components 
as described further below  the process of allocating property costs to its components involves a considerable amount of subjective judgments to be made by company management 
if the company does not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimates the useful lives of its real estate  depreciation expense may be misstated 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the company uses a year estimated life for buildings and improvements and a year estimated life for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
renovations and improvements that improve and or extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life  generally five to ten years 
upon acquisitions of real estate  the company assesses the fair value of acquired tangible assets including land  buildings and personal property  which is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and considers whether there were significant intangible assets acquired for example  above and below market leases  the value of acquired in place leases  and tenant relationships and acquired liabilities  and allocates the purchase price based on these assessments 
the as if vacant value is allocated to land  buildings  and personal property based on management s determination of the relative fair value of these assets 
the estimated fair value of the property is the amount that would be recoverable upon the disposition of the property 
techniques used to estimate fair value include discounted cash flow analysis and reference to recent sales of comparable properties 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known trends  and market economic conditions that may affect the property 
land value is assigned based on the purchase price if land is acquired separately  or based on estimated market value if acquired in a merger or in a portfolio acquisition 
above market and below market in place lease values for acquired properties are estimated based on the present value of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the lease 
the company performs this analysis on a lease by lease basis 
the capitalized above market or below market intangible is amortized to rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in place lease values that are based upon the company s evaluation of the specific characteristics of the leases 
factors considered in these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods  considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
the company also considers information about each property obtained during its pre acquisition due diligence and marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
property sales or dispositions are recorded when title transfers and sufficient consideration is received by the company and the company has no significant continuing involvement with the property sold 
impairment 
the company s long lived assets are reviewed for impairment quarterly if events or changes in circumstances such as adverse market conditions  including conditions resulting from an ongoing economic recession indicate that a long lived asset might be impaired 
judgments regarding existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance  market conditions  expected holding period of each asset and events that occur that affect the financial strength of significant tenants of the assets  including tenants who have filed for bankruptcy 
for long lived assets in which an impairment indicator is present  the company compares 
index annual report the expected future undiscounted cash flows for the long lived asset against the carrying amount of the asset  including any associated intangibles  subject to evaluation 
the evaluation of undiscounted cash flows is subjective and reflects assumptions regarding current market conditions relative to the long lived asset being evaluated  such as future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements 
a worsening real estate market may cause the company to re evaluate the assumptions used in our impairment analysis 
if there is an indication of impairment based on this evaluation because the expected undiscounted cash flows plus reversion are less than the asset s carrying value  impairment is recorded based on the estimated fair value typically based on a current independent appraisal of the long lived asset in comparison to its carrying value 
the results of the company s evaluation of impairment analysis could be material to the company s financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company periodically evaluates the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts approximately  as of april  for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under their respective lease agreements 
the company also maintains an allowance for deferred rents receivable arising from the straight lining of rents approximately  as of april  and from mortgage loans approximately  as of april  
the straight lining of rents receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under lease agreements 
management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates 
if estimates differ from actual results this would impact reported results 
revenue recognition the company has the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies base rents income arising from tenant leases 
these rents are recognized over the non cancelable term of the related leases on a straight line basis  which includes the effects of rent increases and abated rent under the leases 
certain leases provide for tenant occupancy during periods for which no rent is due or where minimum rent payments increase during the term of the lease 
rental revenue is recorded for the full term of each lease on a straight line basis 
accordingly  the company records a receivable from tenants for rents that it expects to collect over the remaining lease term as deferred rents receivable 
when the company acquires a property  the term of the existing leases is considered to commence as of the acquisition date for the purposes of this calculation 
revenue recognition is considered to be critical because the evaluation of the reliability of such deferred rents receivable involves management assumptions relating to such tenant viability 
percentage rents income arising from retail tenant leases which are contingent upon the sales of the tenant exceeding a defined threshold 
these rents are recognized only after the contingency has been removed ie  sales thresholds have been achieved 
expense reimbursement income revenue arising from tenant leases  which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property 
this revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred 
income taxes 
the company operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a reit under sections of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
under those sections  a reit which distributes at least of its reit taxable income as a distribution to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders 
the company intends to distribute to its shareholders of its taxable income 
therefore  no provision for federal income taxes is required 
if the company fails to distribute the required amount of income to its shareholders  it would fail to qualify as a reit and substantial adverse tax consequences may result 
the company has one trs  acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  which is subject to corporate federal and state income taxes on its taxable income at regular statutory rates 
for fiscal years and  the company s trs had a net operating loss 
there were no income tax provisions or material deferred income tax items for our trs for the fiscal years ended april  and the company s trs is the tenant in the company s wyoming assisted living facilities 
the company s taxable income is affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the following that the company s tenants perform their obligations under their leases with the company and that the company s tax and accounting positions do not change 
these factors  which impact the company s taxable income  are subject to 
index annual report change  and many are outside the control of the company 
if actual results vary  the company s taxable income may change 
recent accounting pronouncements for disclosure regarding recent accounting pronouncements and the anticipated impact they will have on our operations  please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations revenues total revenues for fiscal year were million  compared to million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year revenues during fiscal year were million greater than revenues in fiscal year and revenues during fiscal year were million greater than in fiscal year for fiscal  the increase in revenue of million resulted from in thousands rent in fiscal from properties acquired in fiscal year in excess of that received in from the same properties rent from properties acquired in fiscal year decrease in rental income on stabilized properties due primarily to a decrease in occupancy for fiscal  the increase in revenue of million resulted from in thousands rent in fiscal from properties acquired in fiscal year in excess of that received in from the same properties rent from properties acquired in fiscal year decrease in rental income on stabilized properties due primarily to a decrease in occupancy as illustrated above  the majority of the increase in our gross revenue for fiscal years and million and million respectively resulted from the addition of new real estate properties to the iret properties portfolio 
rental revenue in fiscal years and from stabilized properties decreased and million  respectively 
for the next months  we continue to look to acquisitions and development of new properties and recovery in our stabilized portfolio to be the most significant factors in any increases in our revenues and ultimately our net income 
however  we have not observed any marked and sustained decline in the prices at which investment properties are offered for sale  which  combined with the general lack of improvement in operating fundamentals  makes identifying attractive acquisition possibilities a continuing challenge 
consequently  there is ongoing uncertainty regarding our ability to identify acquisition targets and our ability to make acquisitions accordingly could be adversely affected 
gain on sale of real estate the company realized a gain on sale of real estate  land and other investments for fiscal year of approximately million 
this compares to approximately  of gain on sale of real estate recognized in fiscal and approximately  recognized in fiscal properties sold in fiscal years and are detailed below in the section captioned property dispositions 
net operating income the following tables report segment financial information 
we measure the performance of our segments based on net operating income noi  which we define as total real estate revenues less real estate expenses and real estate taxes excluding depreciation and amortization related to real estate investments and impairment of real estate investments 
we believe that noi is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a reit s operating real estate because it provides a measure of core operations that is unaffected by depreciation  
index annual report amortization  financing and general and administrative expense 
noi does not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income  net income available for common shareholders or cash flow from operating activities as a measure of financial performance 
the following tables show real estate revenues  real estate operating expenses and noi by reportable operating segment for fiscal years  and for a reconciliation of net operating income of reportable segments to net income as reported  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 
the tables also show net operating income by reportable operating segment on a stabilized property and non stabilized property basis 
stabilized properties are properties owned for the entirety of the periods being compared  and  in the case of development or re development properties  which have achieved a target level of occupancy 
this comparison allows the company to evaluate the performance of existing properties and their contribution to net income 
management believes that measuring performance on a stabilized property basis is useful to investors because it enables evaluation of how the company s properties are performing year over year 
management uses this measure to assess whether or not it has been successful in increasing net operating income  renewing the leases of existing tenants  controlling operating costs and appropriately handling capital improvements

south main minot  nd total property dispositions funds from operations iret considers funds from operations ffo a useful measure of performance for an equity reit 
iret uses the definition of ffo adopted by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit 
nareit defines ffo to mean net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
because of limitations of the ffo definition adopted by nareit  iret has made certain interpretations in applying the definition 
iret believes all such interpretations not specifically provided for in the nareit definition are consistent with the definition 

index annual report iret management considers that ffo  by excluding depreciation costs  the gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate properties and extraordinary items as defined by gaap  is useful to investors in providing an additional perspective on iret s operating results 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap assumes  through depreciation  that the value of real estate assets decreases predictably over time 
however  real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions 
nareit s definition of ffo  by excluding depreciation costs  reflects the fact that depreciation charges required by gaap may not reflect underlying economic realities 
additionally  the exclusion  in nareit s definition of ffo  of gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets  allows iret management and investors to better identify the operating results of the long term assets that form the core of iret s investments  and assists in comparing those operating results between periods 
ffo is used by iret s management and investors to identify trends in occupancy rates  rental rates and operating costs 
while ffo is widely used by reits as a primary performance metric  not all real estate companies use the same definition of ffo or calculate ffo in the same way 
accordingly  ffo presented here is not necessarily comparable to ffo presented by other real estate companies 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of iret s performance  but rather should be considered as an additional  supplemental measure  and should be viewed in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap  and is not necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of iret s needs or its ability to service indebtedness or make distributions 
ffo applicable to common shares and limited partnership units for the fiscal year ended april  was million  compared to million and million for the fiscal years ended april  and  respectively 
the increase in ffo in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was due to those factors discussed above in the sections titled changes in expenses and net income and factors impacting net income during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year reconciliation of net income attributable to investors real estate trust to funds from operations for the years ended april   and in thousands  except per share and unit amounts fiscal years ended april  amount weighted avg shares and units per share and unit amount weighted avg shares and units per share and unit amount weighted avg shares and units per share and unit net income attributable to investors real estate trust less dividends to preferred shareholders net income available to common shareholders adjustments noncontrolling interests operating partnership depreciation and amortization gains on depreciable property sales funds from operations applicable to common shares and units real estate depreciation and amortization consists of the sum of depreciation amortization related to real estate investments and amortization related to non real estate investments from the consolidated statements of operations  totaling   and  and depreciation amortization from discontinued operations of   and  less corporate related depreciation and amortization on office equipment and other assets of  and for the fiscal year ended april   and upreit units of the operating partnership are exchangeable for common shares of beneficial interest on a one for one basis 
net income is calculated on a per share basis 
ffo is calculated on a per share and unit basis 

index annual report cash distributions the following cash distributions were paid to our common shareholders and upreit unitholders during fiscal years  and fiscal years quarters first second third fourth the fiscal year cash distributions increased over the cash distributions paid during fiscal year  and fiscal year cash distributions increased over the cash distributions paid during fiscal year liquidity and capital resources overview the company s principal liquidity demands are maintaining distributions to the holders of the company s common and preferred shares of beneficial interest and upreit units  capital improvements and repairs and maintenance to the company s properties  acquisition of additional properties  property development  tenant improvements and debt service and repayments 
the company has historically met its short term liquidity requirements through net cash flows provided by its operating activities  and  from time to time  through draws on its unsecured lines of credit 
management considers the company s ability to generate cash from property operating activities  cash out refinancing of existing properties and  from time to time  draws on its line of credit to be adequate to meet all operating requirements and to make distributions to its shareholders in accordance with the reit provisions of the internal revenue code 
budgeted expenditures for ongoing maintenance and capital improvements and renovations to our real estate portfolio are also generally expected to be funded from existing cash on hand  cash flow generated from property operations  cash out refinancing of existing properties  and or new borrowings 
however  the commercial and residential real estate markets continue to experience significant challenges including reduced occupancies and rental rates as well as restrictions on the availability of financing 
in the event of further deterioration in property operating results  or absent the company s ability to successfully continue cash out refinancing of existing properties and or new borrowings  the company may need to consider additional cash preservation alternatives  including scaling back development activities  capital improvements and renovations 
for the fiscal year ended april   the company paid distributions totaling million in cash and million in common shares pursuant to our drip to common shareholders and unitholders of the operating partnership  as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million and funds from operations of million 
additional cash to fund the distribution was provided by property refinancings in which the company was able to withdraw cash following the placement of new mortgages on company properties 
subsequent to the end of fiscal year  the board of trustees of the company approved a plan to reduce the company s quarterly distribution to from per common share and limited partnership unit an indicated annual rate of per share unit  effective with the next quarterly distribution planned for october  the board of trustees currently intends to maintain this level of cash distribution for at least the next four quarters 
all future distributions remain subject to the discretion of the company s board of trustees 
to the extent the company does not satisfy its long term liquidity requirements  which consist primarily of maturities under the company s long term debt  construction and development activities and potential acquisition opportunities  through net cash flows provided by operating activities and its credit facilities  the company intends to satisfy such requirements through a combination of funding sources which the company believes will be available to it  including the issuance of upreit units  additional common or preferred equity  proceeds from the sale of properties  and additional long term secured or unsecured indebtedness 
however  our ability to raise funds through the sale of equity securities  the sale of properties  and additional long term secured or unsecured borrowings is dependent on  among other things  general economic conditions  general market conditions for reits  our operating performance  and the current trading price of our common shares  and the capital and debt markets 
index annual report may not consistently be available at all or on terms that we consider attractive 
in particular  as a result of the recent economic downturn and turmoil in the capital markets  the availability of secured and unsecured loans was for a time sharply curtailed 
we cannot predict whether these conditions will recur 
as a result of general economic conditions in our markets  economic downturns affecting the ability to attract and retain tenants  unfavorable fluctuations in interest rates or our share price  unfavorable changes in the supply of competing properties  or our properties not performing as expected  we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or otherwise have access to capital on favorable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain capital from other sources  we may not be able to pay the distribution required to maintain our status as a reit  make required principal and interest payments  make strategic acquisitions or make necessary routine capital improvements or undertake re development opportunities with respect to our existing portfolio of operating assets 
in addition  if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments  the holder of the mortgage could foreclose on the property  resulting in loss of income and asset values 
sources and uses of cash as of april   the company had one secured line of credit with first international bank and trust  watford city  north dakota  as lead bank 
this line of credit matures on august   and had  as of april   lending commitments of million  with the capacity to grow to million 
participants in the line of credit include several banks whose previous separate credit lines to the company were terminated during the second quarter of fiscal year following their consolidation into the first international bank led facility 
participants in this secured credit facility as of april  included  in addition to first international bank  the following financial institutions the bank of north dakota  first western bank and trust  dacotah bank  united community bank of north dakota american state bank trust company and town country credit union 
as of april   the company had advanced million under the line of credit 
the line of credit has a minimum outstanding principal balance requirement of million 
the facility includes customary loan covenants including restrictions regarding minimum debt service ratios to be maintained in the aggregate and individually on properties in the collateral pool  and the company is also required to maintain minimum depository account s totaling million with first international  of which million is to be held in a non interest bearing account 
as of april   the management of the company believes it is in compliance with the facility covenants 
the company also maintains compensating balances  not restricted as to withdrawal  with several financial institutions in connection with financing received from those institutions and or to ensure future credit availability  as follows dacotah bank  minot  north dakota  a deposit of  united community bank  minot  north dakota  deposit of  commerce bank  a minnesota banking corporation  deposit of  first international bank  watford city  north dakota  deposit of million  peoples state bank of velva  north dakota  deposit of  associated bank  green bay  wisconsin  deposit of  and equity bank  minnetonka  minnesota  deposit of in september  the company filed a shelf registration statement on form s to offer for sale from time to time common shares and preferred shares 
this registration statement was declared effective in october we may sell any combination of common shares and preferred shares up to an aggregate initial offering price of million during the period that the registration statement remains effective 
during fiscal year  the company sold million common shares under this registration statement  under its continuous offering program with robert w 
baird co 
incorporated as sales agent  for net proceeds of approximately million  before offering expenses but after underwriting discounts and commissions 
as of april   the company had available securities under this registration statement in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
this amount is reserved for issuance under the company s continuous offering program with robert w 
baird co 
incorporated 
in april  the company filed a shelf registration statement on form s to register any combination of common shares and preferred shares up to an aggregate initial offering price of million during the period that the registration statement remains effective 
to date the company has not issued any common or preferred shares under this registration statement 
economic conditions in the united states have begun to show some signs of improvement  but the sustainability of a recovery is still uncertain and economic growth has been sluggish and weak 
credit markets also appear to have stabilized  and in our experience credit availability has improved compared to the recent recessionary period  as bank earnings and liquidity recover  particularly among the larger financial institutions 
in fiscal year  however  we observed that while benchmark interest rates such as libor remained near historic lows  underwriting 
index annual report on commercial real estate continued to be more conservative compared to the underwriting standards employed prior to the recessionary period  with recourse security more frequently required  lower amounts of proceeds available  and lenders limiting the amount of financing available to existing relationships in an effort to manage capital allocations and credit risk 
accordingly  while we continue to expect to be able to refinance our maturing debt in our commercial office  medical  industrial and retail segments  we also expect lenders to continue to employ conservative underwriting regarding asset quality  occupancy levels and tenant creditworthiness  and we are correspondingly cautious regarding our ability in fiscal year to rely on cash out refinancings at levels we have achieved in recent years to provide funds for investment opportunities and other corporate purposes 
additionally  while to date there has been no material negative impact on our ability to borrow in our multi family segment  we continue to closely monitor proposals to modify the roles of the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac and the federal national mortgage association fannie mae in financing multi family residential properties  we consider that one of the consequences of a modification in the agencies roles could potentially be a narrowing of their lending focus away from the smaller secondary or tertiary markets which we generally target  to multi family residential properties in major metropolitan markets 
iret obtains a majority of its multi family debt from primarily freddie mac  and we continue to plan to refinance a majority of our maturing multi family debt with these two entities  so any change in their ability or willingness to lend going forward would most likely result in higher loan costs and or more constricted availability of financing for us 
as of april   approximately  or million of our mortgage debt maturing in the next twelve months is placed on multi family residential assets  and approximately  or million  is placed on properties in our four commercial segments 
mortgage debt maturing in the first two quarters of fiscal year consists of approximately million on multi family residential assets  and approximately million on properties in our four commercial segments 
of this million  as of june   we have signed commitments to refinance approximately million in commercial debt  and are working to either refinance  renew  pay off with cash or apply credit line facilities to the remainder of the maturing debt 
despite these market uncertainties  and a continued tightening in credit standards by lenders  iret during fiscal year acquired properties with an investment cost totaling million 
in fiscal year  iret disposed of four multi family residential properties and one property in each of its commercial medical  industrial and retail segments  for sales prices totaling approximately million  compared to dispositions totaling  in fiscal year the company has a distribution reinvestment and share purchase plan drip 
the drip provides shareholders of the company an opportunity to invest their cash distributions in common shares of the company at a discount currently from the market price  and to purchase additional common shares of the company with voluntary cash contributions  also at a discount to the market price 
the maximum monthly investment permitted without prior company approval is currently  during fiscal year  the company revised its drip to permit the company to issue waivers to drip participants to provide for investments in excess of the  maximum monthly investment 
no such waivers were granted during fiscal year during fiscal year  approximately million common shares were issued under the drip plan  with an additional million common shares issued during fiscal year  and million common shares issued during fiscal year the issuance of upreit units for property acquisitions continues to be a source of capital for the company 
approximately  units were issued in connection with property acquisitions during fiscal year  and approximately  units and  units  respectively  were issued in connection with property acquisitions during fiscal years and as a result of the issuance of common shares pursuant to our shelf registration statement and distribution reinvestment plan  net of fractional shares repurchased  the company s equity capital increased during fiscal by million 
additionally  the equity capital of the company increased by million as a result of contributions of real estate in exchange for upreit units  as summarized above  resulting in a total increase in equity capital of million from these sources during fiscal year the company s equity capital increased by million and million in fiscal years and  respectively  as a result of the issuance of common shares pursuant to our shelf registration statement and distribution reinvestment plan  net of fractional shares repurchased  and contributions of real estate in exchange for upreit units 
cash and cash equivalents on april  totaled million  compared to million and million on the same date in and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased slightly to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year due primarily to changes in deferred charges and 
index annual report accounts payable  accrued expenses  and other liabilities 
despite a decrease in net income  net cash provided by operating activities increased slightly to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  due to multiple factors including changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable and other non cash items 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal year  compared to million of net cash used by investing activities in fiscal year net cash used by investing activities was million in fiscal year the increase in net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily a result of an increase in proceeds from the sale of real estate coupled with a reduction in expenditures for acquisitions and improvements of real estate investments 
net cash used by financing activities during fiscal year was million  compared to million provided by financing activities during fiscal year  with the change due primarily to a decrease in proceeds from the sale of common shares  a decrease in proceeds from mortgages payable and an increase in principal payments on mortgages payable 
net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year was million  compared to million used by financing activities during fiscal year the difference was due primarily to an increase in proceeds from the sale of common shares and an increase in proceeds from mortgage borrowings and refinancings  net of principal payments on mortgages 
financial condition mortgage loan indebtedness 
mortgage loan indebtedness decreased to million on april  from billion on april   due to principal payments and loan payoffs  net of new debt

mortgage loans receivable 
mortgage loans receivable net of allowance decreased to approximately  at april   from approximately  at april  property owned

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited primarily to fluctuations in the general level of interest rates on our current and future fixed and variable rate debt obligations  and secondarily to our deposits with and investments in certain products issued by various financial institutions 
variable interest rates 
because approximately of our mortgage debt  as of april  and respectively  as of april  and  is at fixed interest rates  we have little exposure to interest rate fluctuation risk on our existing mortgage debt 
however  even though our goal is to maintain a fairly low exposure to interest rate risk  we are still vulnerable to significant fluctuations in interest rates on any future repricing or refinancing of our fixed or variable rate debt and on future debt 
we primarily use long term more than nine years and medium term five to seven years debt as a source of capital 
we do not currently use derivative securities
