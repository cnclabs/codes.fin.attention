overview athenahealth provides business services that help medical practices achieve and sustain financial health by collecting more money and exercising more control over their administrative tasks 
these services are designed to reduce the administrative burden of complex billing rules  quality measurement and reporting  clinical documentation and data exchange  patient communication  and many of the related tasks that distract medical providers and staff from the practice of medicine 
our services are delivered and consumed through a single instance of our cloud based platform  athenanet 
we differentiate our services by regularly deploying updates and improvements through athenanet to clients without any action on the part of the client 
athenanet enables us to quickly implement our solution at a low up front cost and to seamlessly work in tandem with our clients in real time 
the services provided through our single instance cloud are currently packaged as three integrated components athenacollector for revenue cycle management  athenaclinicals for clinical cycle management  and athenacommunicator for patient cycle management 
the use of our single instance platform allows all clients to benefit from the collective knowledge of all of our other clients through our patented billing rules engine and our clinical quality management engine 
our clients use these rules engines to monitor and benchmark their performance with peer practices across the network 
our business intelligence application  anodyne analytics  also supports our clients in their pursuit of financial health by equipping users with data visualization tools and insight into their practice s performance 
each service we provide is supported by a model comprised of three distinct components software  knowledge  and work 
the cloud based software is provided at no extra charge to users but is the primary conduit through which we exchange information between clients  payers  and our staff of experts 
knowledge is infused into each of our services via our rules engine as we work with clients  payers  and other partners to codify rules associated with reimbursement  clinical quality measures  and other factors related to our clients performance 
the third component to each of our services is the work that we perform on behalf of our clients 
wherever possible  we replace manual processes with automation  but where automation is not possible  we provide that manual labor rather than returning it to clients to be completed 
this unique service model of software  knowledge  and work has allowed us to align our success with our clients performance  creating a continual cycle of improvement and efficiency 
we charge clients a percentage of collections in most cases  so our financial results are a direct reflection of our ability to drive revenue to medical practices 
in  we generated revenue of million from the sale of our services compared to million in and million in given the scope of our market opportunity  we have increased our spending each year on growth  innovation  and infrastructure 
despite increased spending in these areas  higher revenue and lower direct operating expense as a percentage of revenue have led to greater operating income 
our revenues are predominately derived from business services that we provide on an ongoing basis 
this revenue is generally determined as a percentage of our clients collections  so the key drivers of our revenue include growth in the number of physicians working within our client accounts and the collections of these physicians 
to provide these services  we incur expense in several categories  including direct operating  selling and marketing  research and development  general and administrative  and depreciation and amortization expense 
in general  our direct operating expense increases as our volume of work increases  whereas our selling and marketing expense increases in proportion to our rate of adding new accounts to our network of physician clients 
our other expense categories are less directly related to growth of revenues and relate more to our planning for the future  our overall business management activities  and our infrastructure 
as our revenues have grown  the difference between our revenue and our direct operating expense also has grown  which has afforded us the ability to spend more in other categories of expense and to experience an increase 
table of contents in operating margin 
we manage our cash and our use of credit facilities to ensure adequate liquidity  in adherence to related financial covenants 
sources of revenue we derive our revenue from two sources from business services which are primarily associated with our revenue  clinical and patient cycle management services and from implementation and other services 
implementation and other services consist primarily of professional services fees related to assisting clients with the initial implementation of our services and for ongoing training and related support services 
business services accounted for approximately of our total revenues for each of the years ended december    and  respectively 
business services fees are typically to of a practice s total collections depending upon the services used and the size  complexity  and other characteristics of the practice  plus a per statement charge for billing statements that are generated for patients of certain clients 
accordingly  business services fees are largely driven by the number of physician practices we serve  the number of physicians and other medical providers working in those physician practices  the volume of activity and related collections of those physicians and other medical providers  the services used by the practice and our contracted rates 
there is moderate seasonality in the activity level of physician practices 
typically  discretionary use of physician services declines in the late summer and during the holiday season  which leads to a decline in collections by our physician clients about to days later 
none of our clients accounted for more than of our total revenues for the years ended december    or operating expense direct operating expense 
direct operating expense consists primarily of salaries  benefits  claim processing costs  other direct costs  and stock based compensation related to personnel who provide services to clients  including staff who implement new clients 
we expense implementation costs as incurred 
although we expect that direct operating expense will increase in absolute terms for the foreseeable future  the direct operating expense is expected to decline as a percentage of revenues as we further increase the percentage of transactions that are resolved on the first attempt and as we decrease the cost of implementation for new clients 
in addition  over the longer term  we expect to increase our overall level of automation and to reduce our direct operating expense as a percentage of revenues as we become a larger operation  with higher volumes of work in particular functions  geographies  and medical specialties 
included in direct operating expense are the service costs associated with our athenaclinicals offering  which includes transaction handling related to lab requisitions  lab results entry  fax classification  and other services 
we have also included in direct operating expense the service costs associated with our athenacommunicator offering  which includes costs based on telephone call volume  live operator answering services  software licenses  and other services 
we also expect these costs to increase in absolute terms for the foreseeable future but to decline as a percentage of revenue 
this decrease will be driven by increased levels of automation and by economies of scale 
direct operating expense does not include allocated amounts for rent  depreciation  and amortization  except for amortization related to purchased intangible assets 
selling and marketing expense 
selling and marketing expense consists primarily of marketing programs including trade shows  brand messaging  and on line initiatives and personnel related expense for sales and marketing employees including salaries  benefits  commissions  stock based compensation  non billable travel  lodging  and other out of pocket employee related expense 
although we recognize substantially all of our revenue when services have been delivered  we recognize a large portion of our sales commission expense at the time of contract signature and at the time our services commence 
accordingly  we incur a portion of our sales and marketing expense prior to the recognition of the corresponding revenue 
we plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing by hiring additional direct sales personnel to add new clients and increase sales to our existing clients 
we also plan to expand our marketing activities in certain areas  such as attending trade shows  expanding user groups  and creating new printed materials as well as expand our external channel partner through the addition of new key strategic partners 
as a result  we expect that  in the future  sales and marketing expense will increase in absolute terms and will likely remain at current levels as a percentage of total revenue in the near term 

table of contents research and development expense 
research and development expense consists primarily of personnel related expenses for research and development employees including salaries  benefits  stock based compensation  non billable travel  lodging  and other out of pocket employee related expense and consulting fees for third party developers 
we expect that  in the future  research and development expense will increase in absolute terms but not as a percentage of total revenue as new services and more mature products require incrementally less new research and development investment 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel related expense for administrative employees including salaries  benefits  stock based compensation  non billable travel  lodging  and other out of pocket employee related expense  occupancy and other indirect costs including building maintenance and utilities  and insurance  as well as software license fees  outside professional fees for accountants  lawyers  and consultants  and compensation for temporary employees 
we expect that general and administrative expense will increase in absolute terms for the foreseeable future as we invest in infrastructure to support our growth and incur additional expense related to being a publicly traded company 
though expenses are expected to continue to rise in absolute terms  we expect general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of total revenues 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense consists primarily of depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of capitalized software development costs  which we amortize over a two year period from the time of release of related software code 
cost for our revenue cycle application are considered maintenance and we expense those costs as incurred  and  as a result  in approximately of our software development expenditures were expensed rather than capitalized 
in the years ended december  and  approximately and  respectively  were expensed rather than capitalized 
as we grow  we will continue to make capital investments in the infrastructure of the business  and we will continue to develop software that we capitalize 
therefore  we expect related depreciation and amortization expense to increase in absolute terms and increase as a percentage of total revenue in the near term 
other income expense 
interest expense consists primarily of interest costs related to our equipment related term leases  our term loan and revolving loans under our credit facility  and our former subordinated term loan  offset by interest income on investments 
interest income represents earnings from our cash  cash equivalents  and investments 
the gain or loss on interest rate derivative contract represents the change in the fair market value of a derivative instrument that is not designated a hedge under the authoritative accounting guidance 
although this derivative has not been designated for hedge accounting  we believe that such instrument is correlated with the underlying cash flow exposure related to variability in interest rate movements on our term loan 
acquisitions acquisition in october  we acquired anodyne health partners  inc  a software as a service saas business intelligence company based in alpharetta  georgia 
we believe that the acquisition of anodyne provides us with expanded service offerings that will better enable us to compete in the large medical group and enterprise markets 
the anodyne saas business intelligence tool enhances customers ability to view all facets of its revenue cycle information and to access and extract critical operational and administrative information from various data systems 
consideration for this transaction was million plus potential additional consideration of million which will be paid over a three year period if anodyne achieves certain business and financial milestones 
as of december   we have paid million of the additional consideration 
acquisition in september  we acquired specified assets and assumed specified liabilities of crest line technologies  llc dba medicalmessaging 
net 
medicalmessaging provided live and automated calling services for healthcare professionals 
the purpose of the acquisition is to augment our core business service offering with medicalmessaging s automated and live communication services 
we believe the purchase of 
table of contents medicalmessaging gave us access to a developed technology that could speed the time to market versus internal development of our own similar product 
in addition  we plan to leverage its existing customer base to increase revenues of the medicalmessaging services 
consideration for this transaction was million including potential additional consideration of million which will be paid over a three year period if medicalmessaging achieves certain financial milestones 
as of december   we have paid million of the additional consideration 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events  and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors we believe to be relevant at the time we prepared our consolidated financial statements 
on a regular basis  we review the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
significant estimates and assumptions are used for  but are not limited to revenue recognition  including our estimated expected customer life  allowance for doubtful accounts  asset impairments  depreciable lives of assets  economic lives and fair value of leased assets  income tax reserves  fair value of stock options  allocation of direct and indirect cost of sales  fair value of contingent consideration  and litigation reserves 
future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty  and accordingly  our accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment 
the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
we evaluate and update our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in our evaluations 
actual results could differ from the estimates we have used 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  as they require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments  and to make estimates about the effect of 
table of contents matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
effect if actual results description judgments and uncertainties differ from assumptions revenue recognition we derive our revenue from business services associated with our revenue cycle  clinical cycle  patient cycle  and analytics offerings and from implementation and other services 
we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied there is evidence of an arrangement  the service has been provided to the client  the collection of the fees is reasonably assured  and the amount of fees to be paid by the client is fixed or determinable 
although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in revenue that could be material 
our arrangements do not contain general rights of return 
all revenue  other than implementation revenue  is recognized when the service is performed 
relative to our business services offering that is based on the collections of amounts by our customers  we do not recognize revenue until our customers have been paid 
as the implementation service is not separable from the ongoing business services  we record implementation fees as deferred revenue until the implementation service is complete  at which time we recognize revenue ratably on a monthly basis over the longer of the estimated expected customer life or contract life 
our clients typically purchase one year contracts that renew automatically upon completion 
in most cases  our clients may terminate their agreements with days notice without cause 
we typically retain the right to terminate client agreements in a similar timeframe 
our clients are billed monthly  in arrears  based either upon a percentage of collections posted to athenanet  minimum fees  flat fees  or per claim fees where applicable 
invoices are generated within the first two weeks of the month and delivered to clients primarily by email 
for most of our clients  fees are then deducted from a pre defined bank account one week after invoice receipt via an auto debit transaction 
amounts that have been invoiced are recorded as revenue or deferred revenue  as appropriate  and are included in our accounts receivable balances 

table of contents effect if actual results description judgments and uncertainties differ from assumptions we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts based on an assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts  the aging of accounts receivable  and other economic information on both an historical and prospective basis 
customer account balances are charged against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
there are no off balance sheet credit exposure related to customer receivable balances 
we are required to recognize our non refundable up front fees over the contract term or estimated expected customer life  whichever is longer 
the determination of the amount of revenue we can recognize each accounting period requires management to make estimates and judgments on the estimated expected customer life 
we considered all factors in the authoritative accounting literature and specifically focused on the following three factors in determining the estimated customer life renewal rate considerations economic life of the product or service industry data our estimate of expected performance period may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the revenue recognized in an accounting period 
for example  if in the future  we need to increase our estimated expected performance period to a period longer than years  the amount we would recognize in each accounting period would decrease 
on the other hand  if in the future  we need to decrease our estimated expected performance period to a period shorter than years  the amount we would recognize in each accounting period would increase 
the amount of deferred revenue related to non refundable up front fees is million as of december  in the quarter when a customer terminates  any unrecognized service fees associated with implementation services before and after services have been started are recognized as revenue in that quarter 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets are also recorded with respect to net operating losses and other tax attribute carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the income of the period that includes the enactment date 
a high degree of judgment is required to determine if  and the extent to which  valuation allowances should be recorded against deferred tax assets 
contingent tax liabilities are based on our assessment of the likelihood that we have incurred a liability 
such liabilities are reviewed based on recent changes in tax laws and regulations  including judicial rulings 
although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income taxes that could be material 

table of contents effect if actual results description judgments and uncertainties differ from assumptions in addition  we are required to establish reserves for tax contingencies 
share based compensation we grant various nonqualified stock based compensation awards  including stock options and restricted stock units 
the share based compensation expense and related income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in fiscal year was million and million  respectively 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options  which is expected to be recognized through we estimate the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the black scholes valuation model  which requires us to make estimates regarding expected option life  stock price volatility and other assumptions 
we have not had sufficient history as a publicly traded company to evaluate its volatility factor and expected term 
as such  we analyzed the volatilities and expected terms of a group of peer companies to support the assumptions used in its calculations for the years ended december    and we averaged the volatilities of the peer companies with in the money options  sufficient trading history and similar vesting terms to generate the assumptions detailed above 
we have not paid and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our shares of common stock  therefore  the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero 
in addition  we are required to utilize an estimated forfeiture rate when calculating the expense for the period 
we estimate the fair value of the restricted stock units using the market price of our common stock on the date of the grant 
the fair value of restricted stock units is amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
we believe that there is a high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation under the authoritative guidance 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of the authoritative guidance in future periods than those currently  the compensation expense that we record in the future may differ significantly from what we have historically reported for future grants 
if the volatility percentage used in calculating our stock compensation expense had fluctuated by  the total stock compensation expense to be recognized over the stock options four year vesting period would have increased or decreased by approximately million 
if the forfeiture rate used in calculating our stock compensation expense had fluctuated by  the total stock compensation expense to be recognized over the stock options four year vesting period would have decreased or increased by approximately million 
software development costs software development costs for internal use are expensed or capitalized based on the stage of development for the software and are amortized over the estimated economic life of the software releases 
under this guidance  costs related to the preliminary project stage of subsequent versions of athenanet and or other technology are expensed as incurred 
costs incurred in the application development stage are capitalized 
such costs are amortized over the software s estimated economic life of two years 
in  approximately of our software development expenditures were expensed rather than capitalized  based upon the stage of development of the software 
in the year ended december   approximately of our software development expenditures were expensed rather than capitalized 
in the year ended december   approximately of our software development expenditures were expensed rather than capitalized 
although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in software development costs that could be material 

table of contents effect if actual results description judgments and uncertainties differ from assumptions contingent consideration contingent consideration in a business combination after january   is measured at fair value at the acquisition date  with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings 
significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period 
accordingly  future business and economic conditions  as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above  can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period 
each period we revalue the contingent consideration obligations associated with certain acquisitions to their then fair value and record increases in the fair value as contingent consideration expense and record decreases in the fair value as a reduction of contingent consideration expense 
increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates  changes in the assumed timing and amount of revenue and expense estimates 
we recorded potential contingent consideration of million in the initial purchase price allocation at its estimated fair value of million related to the anodyne health partners  inc acquisition in october the change in the assumptions  and other factors  resulted in a decrease of million in the fair value of the total contingent consideration during the year ended december  the company paid million during the year ended december   under the terms of the second potential contingent consideration 
the balance as of december   was million

direct operating employee related costs  excluding stock based compensation  increased million from the year ended december   to the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the increase in headcount since december  we increased the professional services headcount as part of our redesign of our client services organization and to meet the current and anticipated demand for our services as our customer base has expanded and includes larger medical groups

our sales and marketing headcount increased by since december   as we hired additional sales personnel to focus on adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing markets

research and development expense 
research and development expense for the year ended december   was million  an increase of million  or  over research and development expense of million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a million increase in employee related costs due to an increase in headcount and an increase in stock based compensation expense of million

interest expense for the year ended december   was million  a decrease of approximately million compared to interest expense of million for the year ended december  the decrease is related to a decrease in the balance outstanding on our capital leases during the loss on interest rate derivative for the year ended december   was million  compared to a gain on interest rate derivative for the year ended december   of million 
the loss was the result of the change in the fair market value of a derivative instrument that was not designated as a hedge instrument under the authoritative guidance 
although this derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting  we believe that the instrument is closely correlated with the underlying exposure  thus managing the associated risk 
the gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not accounted for as hedges are recognized in earnings

we recorded a provision of million for income taxes for the year ended december   based upon an effective tax rate of compared to a provision of million for the income taxes for the year ended december   based upon an effective tax rate of 
the decrease in our effective tax rate was due to a decrease in our state tax rate and a decrease in the effect of our permanent differences as percent of the overall rate

depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december   was million  an increase of million  or  from depreciation and amortization of million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the addition of assets during and year ended december  change amount amount amount percent interest income interest expense gain loss on interest rate derivative contract other income total other income not meaningful other income expense 
interest income for the year ended december   was million  a decrease of million from interest income of million for the year ended december  the decrease was directly related to the lower interest rates during the year 
interest expense for the year ended december   was million  an increase of approximately million over interest expense of million for the year ended december  the increase is related to an increase in the balance outstanding on our capital leases during and a full year of interest expense relating to our term and revolving loans 
the loss on interest rate derivative for the year ended december   was million  compared to a gain on interest rate derivative for the year ended december   of million 
the gain was the result of the change in the fair market value of a derivative instrument that was not designated a hedge instrument under the authoritative guidance 
although this derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting  we believe that the instrument is closely correlated with the underlying exposure  thus managing the associated risk 
the gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not accounted for as hedges are recognized in earnings 
income tax provision 
we recorded a provision of million for the income taxes for the year ended december   based upon an effective tax rate of 
we recorded a benefit of million for income taxes for the period of december   which included a reversal of the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of the company 
we consider whether a valuation allowance is needed on its deferred tax assets by evaluating all positive and negative evidence relative to its ability to recover deferred tax assets 
prior to the year ended december   we had incurred losses and it is difficult to assert that deferred tax assets are recoverable with this negative evidence 
during the fourth quarter of  our results of operations generated a cumulative profit as measured over the current and prior two years 
in addition  we had been profitable for six consecutive quarters before releasing the allowance 
based on consideration of the 
table of contents weight of positive and negative evidence  including forecasted operating results  we concluded that there was sufficient positive evidence that our deferred tax assets were more likely than not recoverable as of december  accordingly  the remaining valuation allowance was reversed as of december  liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity since our inception  we have funded our growth primarily through the private sale of equity securities  totaling approximately million  as well as through long term debt  working capital  equipment financing loans  and  in september  we completed our initial public offering which provided net proceeds of approximately million 
as of december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
our cash investments consist of corporate debt securities  us treasury and government agency securities  and commercial paper 
as specified in our investment policy  we place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  the policy limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue or issuer and seeks to manage these assets to achieve our goals of preserving principal  maintaining adequate liquidity at all times  and maximizing returns 
our total indebtedness was million at december  we have an unused revolving credit facility in the amount of million 
the credit facility may be extended by up to an additional million on the satisfaction of certain conditions 
there was no balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility during the credit facility expires on september  we are currently evaluating our options relating to our credit facilities 
in addition  we have a term loan facility used for general working capital needs 
at december   we have million outstanding on the term facility 
the term facility matures on september  at december   there was a net present value of million in aggregate principal amount outstanding under a series of capital leases with one finance company 
each of the leases are payable on a monthly basis through december the credit facility and term loan facility contains certain financial and nonfinancial covenants  including limitations on our consolidated leverage ratio and capital expenditures  defaults relating to non payment  breach of covenants  inaccuracy of representations and warranties  default under other indebtedness including a cross default with our interest rate swap  bankruptcy and insolvency  inability to pay debts  attachment of assets  adverse judgments  erisa violations  invalidity of loan and collateral documents  and change of control 
upon an event of default  the lenders may terminate the commitment to make loans and the obligation to extend letters of credit  declare the unpaid principal amount of all outstanding loans and interest accrued under the credit agreement to be immediately due and payable  require us to provide cash and deposit account collateral for our letter of credit obligations  and exercise their security interests and other rights under the credit agreement 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial and non financial covenants under this agreement 
we believe our sources of liquidity will be sufficient to sustain operations  to finance our strategic initiatives  make payments on our contractual obligations  and our purchases of property and equipment for at least the next twelve months 
our analysis is supported by the growth in our new customer base and a high rate of renewal rates with our existing customers and the corresponding increase in billings and collections 
in addition  we may pursue acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses or technologies  in which case we may need to raise additional funds sooner than expected 
however  there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate cash flows at or above current levels or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our existing credit facility or obtain additional financing 
commitments we enter into various purchase commitments with vendors in the normal course of business 
we had no material purchase commitments of capital assets at december  we currently anticipate our aggregate capital expenditures to be approximately million to million for the next twelve months 
we believe 
table of contents that our existing sources of liquidity will be adequate to fund these purchases during the year in the normal course of business  we make representations and warranties that guarantee the performance of services under service arrangements with clients 
historically  there has been no material losses related to such guarantees 
operating cash flow activities for the year ended december  net income non cash adjustments to net income cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities net cash provided by operating activities cash flow from operations increased by million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is mainly attributable to increases in net income  add backs of non cash expense items  and increases in our changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the increase in net income is primarily due to the growth in our customer base  stability in renewal rates with our existing customer base  the associated increase in billings and collections  and selling additional services into our existing customer base 
these increases are partially offset by an increase in operating expenses that require cash outlays such as salaries  higher commissions  direct operating expenses  and marketing expenses 
these expenses increased in absolute terms but remain relatively consistent as a percentage of revenue 
the increase in add backs of non cash expenses during are primarily due to increases in depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation expense  and our provision for uncollectible accounts 
the increases are off set by an increase in excess tax benefits from stock based awards and a decrease in our deferred income taxes 
the increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily attributed to capital expenditures of million during the year ended december   and a full year of the amortization of intangibles assets purchased in our acquisition of anodyne health partners  inc in october of the increase in stock based compensation expense is primarily due to the increase in the volume and the value of stock based awards granted during over grants in the decrease in deferred income taxes was mainly attributable to our use of federal and state nols 
the increase to our changes in operating assets and liabilities during were due primarily to an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a smaller increase in accounts receivable 
the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets is mainly attributable to purchases of software licenses during and an increase in excess tax benefit from stock based awards 
we have reclassed excess tax benefits to financing activities  resulting in a corresponding decrease in our net cash provided by operating activities 
accounts receivable increased approximately while revenue increased approximately during fiscal year this can be attributed to our dso decreasing to days for the fourth quarter of compared to a dso of days for the fourth quarter of investing cash flow activities the cash used by investing activities increased by million to million from million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of purchases of property and equipment  capitalized software development costs and our short term investment activities 
we make investments in property and equipment and in software development on an ongoing basis 
our investment in equipment consists primarily of purchases of technology infrastructure to provide service stability and additional capacity to support our expanding client base 
we purchased million of additions and upgrades to our technology infrastructure during the year we plan on purchasing approximately million to million on our technology infrastructure for the year our purchases of property were primarily for adding additional space to our existing leased and owned facilities and for new computers to support our growth in the number of employees 
the purchases for facilities and other employee related growth was approximately million for the year ended december  we 
table of contents plan on spending approximately million of additional facility expansion and other employee related growth items to meet our hiring plans for the next twelve months 
our investment in software development consist of company managed design  development  and testing of new application functionality with our less mature service offerings  which primarily include our athenaclinicals and athenacommunicator service offerings 
our capitalized software development amounted to million for the year ended december  we plan to spend approximately million to million on software development projects for the year during  we purchased an aircraft for million to transport our employees between our operational locations and for customer and prospects visits 
financing cash flow activities the cash provided in financing activities increased by million to million from million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase is attributable to an increase in the proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the increase in the excess tax benefit from stock based awards 
we recorded a reduction in income tax liability of related to excess tax deductions received from employee stock option exercises 
the benefit was recorded as additional paid in capital 
we also recorded million payment of contingent consideration relating to the anodyne acquisition that was recorded as of the acquisition date 
contractual obligations we have contractual obligations under our equipment line of credit  revolving and term loans and we also maintain operating leases for property and certain office equipment 
the following table summarizes our long term contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period less than after total year years years years other long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations other total these amounts exclude interest payments of million that are due in the next three years on the capital lease obligations and million that are due in the next four years on our long term debt obligations 
the commitments under our operating leases shown above consist primarily of lease payments for our watertown  massachusetts  corporate headquarters  our rome  georgia  offices  our alpharetta  georgia  subsidiary location  and our chennai  india  subsidiary location 
on february   we purchased a complex of buildings  including approximately  square feet of office space  on approximately acres of land located in belfast  maine  for a total purchase price of million from a wholly owned subsidiary of bank of america corporation 
we use this facility as a second operational service site and intend to lease a small portion of the space to commercial tenants 
other amount consists of uncertain tax benefits 
as of december   we cannot reasonably estimate when any future cash outlays would occur related to these uncertain tax positions 
as of december   we have million accrued for contingent considerations estimated to be payable upon anodyne reaching specific performance metrics over the initial three years of operations after acquisition 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements as of december    and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
other than our operating leases for office space and computer equipment  we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements from time to time  new accounting pronouncements are issued by fasb and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date 
unless otherwise discussed  we believe that the impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements will not have a material impact on consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows  or do not apply to our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the indian rupee 
none of our consolidated revenues are generated outside the united states 
none of our vendor relationships  including our contracts with our offshore service providers  international business machines corporation and vision process business solutions inc  for work performed in india or the philippines  is denominated in any currency other than the us dollar 
although the contracts are denominated in us dollars  the fees in one of our vendor contracts are subject to adjustment based upon fluctuation in exchange rates between the india rupees and the us dollar 
in and  and  respectively  of our expenses occurred in our direct subsidiary in chennai  india  and were incurred in indian rupees 
we therefore believe that the risk of a significant impact on our operating income from foreign currency fluctuations is not substantial 
interest rate sensitivity 
we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling million at december  these amounts are held for working capital purposes and were invested primarily in deposits  money market funds  and short term  interest bearing  investment grade securities 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
the value of these securities  however  will be subject to interest rate risk and could fall in value if interest rates rise 
interest rate risk as of december   we had long term debt and capital lease obligations totaling million  which have both variable and fixed interest rate components 
we have entered into interest rate swaps as a hedge relating to variability in interest rate movements on our term loan 
for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value  but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant
