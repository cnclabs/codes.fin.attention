item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations corporate profile and overview landmark bancorp  inc is a one bank holding company incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware and is engaged in the banking business through its wholly owned subsidiary  landmark national bank 
landmark bancorp is listed on the nasdaq global market under the symbol lark 
landmark national bank is dedicated to providing quality financial and banking services to its local communities 
our strategy includes continuing a tradition of quality assets while growing our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios 
we are committed to developing relationships with our borrowers and providing a total banking service 
landmark national bank is principally engaged in the business of attracting deposits from the general public and using such deposits  together with federal home loan bank borrowings and funds from operations  to originate commercial real estate and non real estate loans  as well as one to four family residential mortgage loans 
landmark national bank also originates small business  multi family residential mortgage  home equity and consumer loans 
although not our primary business function  we do invest in certain investment and mortgage related securities using deposits and other borrowings as funding sources 
our results of operations depend generally on net interest income  which is the difference between interest income from interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
while net interest income has remained relatively flat for the past three years  our results have been affected by certain non interest related items  including increases in the provision for loan losses 
net interest income is affected by regulatory  economic and competitive factors that influence interest rates  loan demand and deposit flows 
in addition  we are subject to interest rate risk to the degree that our interest earning assets mature or reprice at different times  or at different speeds  than our interest bearing liabilities 
our results of operations are also affected by non interest income  such as service charges  loan fees and gains from the sale of newly originated loans and gains or losses on investments 
our principal operating expenses  aside from interest expense  consist of compensation and employee benefits  occupancy costs  federal deposit insurance costs  data processing expenses and provision for loan losses 
we are significantly impacted by prevailing economic conditions including federal monetary and fiscal policies and federal regulations of financial institutions 
deposit balances are influenced by numerous factors such as competing investments  the level of income and the personal rate of savings within our market areas 
factors influencing lending activities include the demand for housing and the interest rate pricing competition from other lending institutions 
currently  our business consists of ownership of landmark national bank  with its main office in manhattan  kansas and twenty branch offices in eastern  central and southwestern kansas 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and require our management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies relate to the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of other real estate  the valuation of investment securities  accounting for income taxes and the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  all of which involve significant judgment by our management 
we perform periodic and systematic detailed reviews of our lending portfolio to assess overall collectability 
the level of the allowance for loan losses reflects our estimate of the collectability of the loan portfolio 
while these estimates are based on substantive methods for determining allowance requirements  nevertheless  actual outcomes may differ significantly from estimated results 
additional explanation of the methodologies used in establishing this reserve are provided in the asset quality and distribution section 
assets acquired through  or in lieu of  foreclosure are to be sold and are initially recorded at the date of foreclosure at fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs through a gain or a charge to the allowance for loan losses  establishing a new cost basis 
subsequent to foreclosure  the company records a charge to earnings if the carrying value of a property exceeds the fair value less estimated costs to sell 
revenue and expenses from operations and subsequent declines in fair value are included in other non interest expense in the statement of earnings 
the company has classified its investment securities portfolio as available for sale  with the exception of certain investments held for regulatory purposes 
the company carries its available for sale investment securities at fair value and employs valuation techniques which utilize observable inputs when those inputs are available 
these observable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing the security  developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the company 
when such information is not available  the company employs valuation techniques which utilize unobservable inputs  or those which reflect the company s own assumptions about market participants  based on the best information available in the circumstances 
these valuation methods typically involve estimated cash flows and other financial modeling techniques 
changes in underlying factors  assumptions  estimates  or other inputs to the valuation techniques could have a material impact on the company s future financial condition and results of operations 
fair value measurements are classified as level quoted prices  level based on observable inputs or level based on unobservable inputs 
available for sale securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized 
purchased premiums and discounts on investment securities are amortized accreted into interest income over the estimated lives of the securities using the interest method 
gains and losses on sales of available for sale securities are recorded on a trade date basis and are calculated using the specific identification method 
the company performs quarterly reviews of the investment portfolio to determine if any investment securities have any declines in fair value which might be considered other than temporary 
the initial review begins with all securities in an unrealized loss position 
the company s assessment of other than temporary impairment is based on its reasonable judgment of the specific facts and circumstances impacting each individual security at the time such assessments are made 
the company reviews and considers factual information  including expected cash flows  the structure of the security  the credit quality of the underlying assets and the current and anticipated market conditions 
as of january   the company adopted the guidance on other than temporary impairments in financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc investments debt and equity securities  which changed the accounting for other than temporary impairments of debt securities and separates the impairment into credit related and other factors for debt securities 
any credit related impairments are realized through a charge to earnings 
if an equity security is determined to be other than temporarily impaired  the entire impairment is realized through a charge to earnings 
we have completed several business and asset acquisitions  which have generated significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets and related amortization 
the values assigned to goodwill and intangibles  as well as their related useful lives  are subject to judgment and estimation by our management 
goodwill and intangibles related to acquisitions are determined and based on purchase price allocations 
the initial value assigned to goodwill is the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
valuation of intangible assets is generally based on the estimated cash flows related to those assets 
performing such a discounted cash flow analysis involves the use of estimates and assumptions 
useful lives are determined based on the expected future period of the benefit of the asset  the assessment of which considers various characteristics of the asset  including the historical cash flows 
due to the number of estimates involved related to the allocation of purchase price and determining the appropriate useful lives of intangible assets  we have identified purchase accounting  and the subsequent impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets  as a critical accounting policy 
goodwill is not amortized  however  it is tested for impairment at each calendar year end or more frequently when events or circumstances dictate 
the impairment test compares the carrying value of goodwill to an implied fair value of the goodwill  which is based on a review of the company s market capitalization adjusted for appropriate control premiums as well as an analysis of valuation multiples of recent  comparable acquisitions 
the company considers the result from each these valuation methods in determining the implied fair value of its goodwill 
a goodwill impairment would be recorded for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value 
the company performed a step one impairment test as of december  by comparing the implied fair value of the company s single reporting unit to its carrying value 
fair value was determined using observable market data  including the company s market capitalization  with control premiums and valuation multiples  compared to recent financial industry acquisition multiples for similar institutions to estimate the fair value of the company s single reporting unit 
the company s step one impairment test indicated that its goodwill was not impaired 
the company can make no assurances that future impairment tests will not result in goodwill impairments 
intangible assets include core deposit intangibles and mortgage servicing rights 
core deposit intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life of ten years on an accelerated basis 
when facts and circumstances indicate potential impairment  the company will evaluate the recoverability of the intangible asset carrying value  using estimates of undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining asset life 
any impairment loss is measured by the excess of carrying value over fair value 
mortgage servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when rights are acquired through the sale of financial assets  primarily one to four family real estate loans  and are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value 
mortgage servicing rights are amortized into non interest expense in proportion to  and over the period of  the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial assets 
servicing assets are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value  and are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the retained rights as compared to amortized cost 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in financial statements or tax returns 
the company recognizes an income tax position only if it is more likely than not that it will be sustained upon irs examination  based upon its technical merits 
once that status is met  the amount recorded will be the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense in our consolidated statements of earnings 
the company assesses it deferred tax assets to determine if the items are more likely than not be realized and a valuation allowance is established for any amounts that are not more likely than not to be realized 
changes in estimates regarding the actual outcome of these future tax consequences  including the effects of irs examinations and examinations by other state agencies  could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  summary of performance 
net earnings for decreased million  or  to million as compared to the decline in earnings was primarily the result of a million increase in our provision for loan losses and a million increase in non interest expenses 
partially offsetting the higher expense was a favorable change of million in our net gains and losses on investment securities and a  increase in our non interest income 
our provision for loan losses increased to million in as compared to million in the provision for loan losses reflected the increased charge offs that occurred in  primarily related to a significant decline in appraised value of the collateral securing a previously identified and impaired construction loan 
while it was necessary to recognize the loss based on appraised value  we continue to pursue payment from the guarantor 
the increased non interest expense was primarily related to a  increase in our foreclosure and other real estate expense as a result of provisions to record valuation allowances to reflect declines in the fair value of certain real estate owned assets  as well as higher compensation and benefits  professional fees and advertising expenses 
we recorded credit related  other than temporary impairment losses on our investment securities portfolio during both and  but the net impairment loss declined from  during to  during also  we realized a  gain on the sale of investments in due to the sale of a portion of our mortgage backed investment securities portfolio  compared to a gain of only  during our increased non interest income in was a result of higher gains on sales of loans and higher fees and service charges 
our net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  increased from for to for the increase in net interest margin was primarily a result of maintaining the yields on our loan portfolio while our deposits and fhlb advances repriced lower in the current low rate environment 
while our net interest margin increased  our average interest earning asset balances declined over the same periods 
the decline in average interest earning assets was a result of a decline in our outstanding loan balances and our decision not to reinvest excess liquidity into lower yielding investments and instead reducing higher cost liabilities 
the decline in our loan balances was the result of multiple factors  including our decision to reduce exposure to construction and land loans  reduced loan demand from our customers  increased loan charge offs and normal run off in our one to four family residential real estate loans 
it is unlikely that we will continue to increase our net interest margin from current levels in the near term and instead may see declines in net interest margin as we currently expect to reinvest some of our future excess liquidity and future cash flows into lower yielding investments

interest income 
interest income for decreased million  or  to million from million for the decline in interest income was primarily the result of a decline in average interest earning assets and lower yields on our investment securities as a result of reinvesting the portfolio s cash flows into the lower yielding investment securities that were available in the current low interest rate environment 
interest income on loans decreased million  or  to million for  due to lower average balances  which decreased from million in to million in and to a lesser extent  a decrease in the average tax equivalent yield on loans from during to during interest income on investment securities decreased million  or  to million for due to lower yields and average balances 
the average tax equivalent yield on our investment securities decreased from during to during average investment securities decreased from million for  to million for as we used some of our investment portfolio cash flows to reduce higher cost fhlb borrowings during interest expense 
interest expense for decreased million  or  to million from million for interest expense on deposits decreased million to million  or  from million in  primarily as a result of lower rates on our maturing certificates of deposit and lower rates on savings  money market and now accounts 
our total cost of deposits declined from during to during while our average interest bearing deposit balances decreased from million in to million in the low interest rate environment has allowed us to reduce the rates on savings  money market and now accounts while generally maintaining our balances 
our higher cost certificate of deposit balances declined during as we priced our offering rates on new or maturing certificates of deposit to reflect our reduced need for funding 
average certificate of deposit balances declined from million in to million in during  interest expense on borrowings decreased  or  due to lower rates and average outstanding borrowings 
our cost of borrowing declined from in to in  while our average outstanding borrowings declined from million during to million during net interest income 
net interest income represents the difference between income derived from interest earning assets and the expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is affected by both the difference between the rates of interest earned on interest earnings assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities interest rate spread as well as the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income for decreased  to million  while our net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  decreased  over the same periods 
our net interest margin increased from in to for the increase in net interest margin occurred primarily because we were able to reduce our costs of funding by more than our yields declined on our interest earning assets as our interest earning assets and liabilities continue to reprice lower in this low interest rate environment 
during we were generally able to maintain yields on our loans while the yields on our investment securities and costs of deposits declined 
our cost of borrowings also declined as some of our higher cost fhlb borrowings matured during however  the improvement in net interest margin was not enough to offset our lower levels of average interest earning assets which declined from million in to million in provision for loan losses 
we maintain  and our board of directors monitors  an allowance for losses on loans 
the allowance is established based upon management periodic evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio  review of significant individual loans and collateral  review of delinquent loans  past loss experience  adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay  current and expected market conditions  and other factors management deems important 
determining the appropriate level of reserves involves a high degree of management judgment and is based upon historical and projected losses in the loan portfolio and the collateral value of specifically identified problem loans 
additionally  allowance strategies and policies are subject to periodic review and revision in response to a number of factors  including current market conditions  actual loss experience and management expectations 
our provision for loan losses during increased million to million  compared to a provision of million during  primarily as a result of a million increase in our net loan charge offs during the increased net loan charge offs in were primarily related to a previously identified and impaired construction loan totaling million  which experienced a significant decline in the appraised value of the collateral securing the loan 
while it was necessary to recognize the million loss associated with this decline in value  we continue to pursue the guarantor for payment due 
also during  we charged off the remaining million balance on a commercial agriculture loan after exhausting our collection attempts 
the commercial agriculture loan charge off exceeded the reserves in the allowance for loan losses by  our provision for loan losses was higher in both and  as compared to historical levels  due to the difficult economic conditions over the past few years and their impact on our loan portfolio which increased our levels of charge offs and nonperforming loans over the same period 
we have been working diligently to identify and address the credit weaknesses in our loan portfolio 
while it is difficult to forecast future events  we believe that our current allowance for loan losses  coupled with our capital levels  loan portfolio management and underlying fundamental earnings before the provision for loan losses  positions us to deal with this challenging environment 
for further discussion of the allowance for loan losses  refer to the asset quality and distribution section 
non interest income 
non interest income increased  or  for  to million  as compared to million in the increase was primarily attributable to increases of  in gains on sales of loans and  in fees and service charges 
our gains on sales of loans remained elevated in primarily due to refinancing activity as a result of low mortgage rates  as well as our expansion of the mortgage lending activities over the past few years 
typically  we sell most of our residential real estate loan originations into the secondary market which results in gains on sales of loans 
we anticipate that higher mortgage rates will likely lead to lower origination volumes of residential real estate loans than we experienced in and and correspondingly expect lower amounts of gains on sales of loans 
our fees and service charges increased as a result of higher fees and service charges on our deposit accounts and increased servicing fee income related to the residential real loans that were sold with servicing retained 
during  we introduced a rewards program for our deposit customers that promoted debit card usage and other customer activity which generated additional non interest income 
we anticipate our rewards program will offset some of the reductions in future non interest income projected as a result of recent changes in debit card and overdraft regulations 
investment securities gains losses 
net gains and losses on investment securities experienced a favorable change of million between and we recorded credit related  other than temporary impairment losses on our investment securities portfolio during both and  but the net impairment loss declined from  during to  during also  we realized a  gain on the sale of investments in due to the sale of a portion of our mortgage backed investment securities portfolio  compared to a gain on the sale of investments of only  during non interest expense 
non interest expense increased million  or  to million during  as compared to million during the increase in non interest expense was primarily due to increases of  in compensation and benefits   in foreclosure and real estate owned expense   in professional fees   in advertising and  in data processing 
annual increases in salary and the may acquisition of a branch in lawrence  kansas contributed to the increase in compensation and benefits expense in compared to our increase in foreclosure and real estate owned expense was a result of higher real estate owned balances and from a  increase in our provision to record valuation allowances to reflect declines in the fair value of certain real estate owned assets from to the increase in professional fees was primarily the result of legal action to pursue the guarantor of a construction loan which was partially charged off in the higher advertising and data processing costs reflect costs associated with customer rewards program 
income taxes 
during  we recorded an income tax benefit of  compared to income tax expense of  or an effective tax rate of  during the decline in effective tax rate was driven by lower taxable income while our tax exempt investment income and bank owned life insurance income remained similar between the years 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  summary of performance 
net earnings for decreased million  or  to million as compared to net earnings of million in the decline in earnings was primarily the result of an increase in our provision for loan losses  impairment charges to our investment security portfolio and increases in fdic premiums 
we increased our provision for loan losses by  in  as compared to  due to the impact of declining residential and commercial real estate values impacting the underlying collateral in our loan portfolio  increased levels of non accrual and past due loans and the impact of the current economic environment on our loan customers 
also during  we identified our portfolio of pooled trust preferred securities as other than temporarily impaired  which resulted in net credit related impairment charges of  our non interest expenses increased by million  to million  during as compared to  primarily as a result of an increase in fdic insurance premiums 
our fdic insurance premiums increased by  as the result of a  special assessment  higher assessment rates and the depletion of our previously unused fdic credits 
we also experienced increases in expenses relating to the acquisition and operation of a second branch in lawrence  kansas and higher foreclosure and other real estate costs 
offsetting the increased expenses was a million increase in non interest income  which was primarily attributable to a million increase in gains on sale of loans driven by higher origination volumes of residential real estate loans that were sold in the secondary market 
results for included a  gain from the prepayment of a fhlb advance  which represented the remaining unamortized fair value adjustment recorded in purchase accounting and  of gains on sales of investment securities 
our net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  increased from for to for during we were able to reduce our cost of deposits and borrowings enough to offset the lower yields earned on loans and investment securities as our interest earning assets and liabilities repriced in markets that experienced a dramatic decline in benchmark interest rates that began in late and continued throughout and the lower cost of funding allowed us to increase our net interest margin in a market that  as of december   still exhibited interest rates that were very low compared to historical levels

interest income 
interest income for decreased million  or  to million from million for the decline in interest income was a result of lower yields on interest earning assets as loans and investments mature and typically reprice lower in a low interest rate environment such as  an increase in non accrual loans and a decline in average interest earning assets 
interest income on loans decreased million  or  to million for  due to a decrease in the average yield on loans from during to during and lower average balances  which decreased to million in from million in average investment securities increased from million for  to million for the average yield on our investment securities decreased to during from during interest income on investment securities decreased  or  to million for as the lower yields more than offset the higher average balances 
the increased levels of investments were the result of the increased liquidity primarily from lower outstanding loan balances 
interest expense 
interest expense for decreased million  or  to million from million for interest expense on deposits decreased million to million  or  from million in primarily as a result of lower rates on our maturing certificates of deposit and lower rates on money market and now accounts due to the decline in interest rates 
our total cost of deposits declined from during to during while our average interest bearing deposit balances increased from million in to million in  the mix of average deposit balances shifted from higher cost certificate of deposit balances to lower cost money market  now and savings accounts contributing to lower cost of deposits

our average outstanding borrowings declined from million during to million during  while our cost of borrowing was in both years 
net interest income 
net interest income for increased  to million  from million in on a tax equivalent basis  net interest income increased  and net interest margin increased to from for and  respectively 
the increase in net interest margin occurred primarily because we were able to reduce our costs of funding by more than our yields declined on our interest earning assets as our interest earning assets and liabilities continue to reprice lower in this low interest rate environment 
the average cost of our liabilities declined while our average yield on assets only declined during as compared to the improvement in net interest margin from interest rates more than offset the lower average balances of interest earning assets which declined from million in to million in provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses for was million  compared to a provision of million during our provision for loan losses increased  in based on the analysis of our loan portfolio  which indicated the additional provision for loan losses was warranted given the impact of declining residential and commercial real estate values impacting the underlying collateral in our loan portfolio  increased levels of non accrual and past due loans and the impact of the current economic environment on our loan customers 
non interest income 
non interest income increased million  or  for  to million  as compared to million in the increase was primarily attributable to an increase of million  or  in gains on sale of loans 
the increased gains on sales of loans were driven by higher origination volumes of residential real estate loans as a result of low mortgage rates and tax incentives to homebuyers that were available in  as well as our expansion of the mortgage lending activities over the past few years 
these residential real estate loans were primarily sold in the secondary market 
partially offsetting the increased gains on sales of loans  was a  gain that was recognized during from the prepayment of a fhlb advance  which represented the remaining unamortized fair value adjustment required by purchase accounting 
investment securities gains losses 
during  each of our three investments in pooled trust preferred securities  with original par values totaling million  were identified as other than temporarily impaired as a result of increased levels of deferrals and defaults on the debt obligations of the financial companies underlying securities  which exceeded our previous expectations 
the increased levels of non performing assets in the collateral pools resulted in the recognition of  of estimated credit losses associated with these investments during  while the non credit related losses of million were recognized in other comprehensive income 
in  we recorded  of gains on sales of investment securities as compared to  during non interest expense 
non interest expense increased million  or  to million during  as compared to this increase was primarily driven by increases of  in fdic insurance premiums   or  in compensation and benefits   or  in professional fees and  or  in foreclosure and other real estate expenses 
the increase in fdic insurance premiums was the result of a  special assessment  which affected all fdic insured institutions  as well as higher assessment rates which have been imposed on all deposit institutions  and the depletion of our previously unused fdic assessment credits 
the increase in compensation and benefits was driven by higher salary costs and the addition of employees resulting from the acquisition of a branch in lawrence  kansas 
the increases in professional fees are primarily associated with our branch acquisition  but were also elevated due to costs associated with outsourcing part of our it management and future compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
the increase in foreclosure and other real estate expenses  which is included in other non interest expense  was the result of increased foreclosure activity and other real estate balances as we address our nonperforming loans 
income taxes 
income tax expense decreased  to  for  from million for our effective tax rate declined from during to for the decrease in income tax expense and the effective tax rate for resulted primarily from a decrease in taxable income  as a percentage of earnings before income taxes  while our tax exempt investment income and bank owned life insurance remained similar between and quarterly results of operations dollars in thousands  except per share amounts quarters ended march june september december interest income interest expense net interest income provision for loan losses net interest income after provision for loan losses non interest income investment securities gains losses  net non interest expense earnings before income taxes income tax expense net earnings earnings per share basic diluted quarters ended march june september december interest income interest expense net interest income provision for loan losses net interest income after provision for loan losses non interest income investment securities gains losses  net non interest expense earnings before income taxes income tax expense net earnings earnings per share basic diluted all per share amounts have been adjusted to give effect to the stock dividend paid during december and financial condition 
the company s asset quality and performance have been affected by the slow economy  difficult credit markets  declines in residential and commercial real estate values  low consumer confidence  high unemployment and decreased consumer spending 
even though the geographic markets in which the company operates have been impacted by the economic slowdown  the effect has not been as severe as those experienced in some areas of the us in addition  the company s loan portfolio is diversified across various types of loans and collateral throughout the markets in which we operate 
outside of the identified problem assets  management believes that it continues to have a high quality asset base and solid core earnings and anticipates that its efforts to run a high quality financial institution with a sound asset base will continue to create a strong foundation for continued growth and profitability in the future 
asset quality and distribution 
our primary investing activities are the origination of commercial real estate  commercial and consumer loans and the purchase of investment and mortgage backed securities 
total assets decreased to million at december   compared to million at december  net loans  excluding loans held for sale  decreased to million at december  from million at december  the million decline in net loans was primarily the result of declines of million in construction and land loans  million in commercial real estate loans and million in commercial loans 
the decline in these loan balances is the result of multiple factors  including management decisions to reduce exposure to construction and land loans  declines in loan demand from our customers and million of net loan charge offs during our one to four family residential real estate loan portfolio also declined by million during due to normal runoff related to principal payments and prepayments 
the outstanding balances in our one to four family residential real estate loan portfolio typically decline as we sell most of our newly originated loans 
generally  we originate fixed rate  residential mortgage loans with maturities in excess of ten years for sale in the secondary market 
these loans are typically sold soon after the loan closing 
while we do not intend to increase our one to four family residential real estate loan portfolio  we may slow the runoff of the portfolio by retaining some of the new loan originations to offset weak commercial loan demand  however most of the new loan originations will still be sold 
we do not originate and warehouse these fixed rate residential loans for resale in order to speculate on interest rates 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based on our evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of our loan activity 
this evaluation  which includes a review of all loans with respect to which full collectability may not be reasonably assured  considers the fair value of the underlying collateral  economic conditions  historical loan loss experience  level of classified loans and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate allowance for losses on loans 
at december   our allowance for loan losses totaled million  or of gross loans outstanding  as compared to million  or of gross loans outstanding  at december  our provision for loan losses during was million  compared to a provision of million during our provision for loan losses was higher in both and  as compared to historical levels  due to the difficult economic conditions over the past few years and its impact on our loan portfolio as well as increased levels of charge offs and nonperforming loans over the same periods 
we have been working diligently to identify and address the credit weaknesses in our loan portfolio 
while it is difficult to forecast future events  we believe that our current allowance for loan losses  coupled with our capital levels  loan portfolio management and underlying fundamental earnings before the provision for loan losses  positions us to deal with this challenging environment 
loans past due days and still accruing interest totaled million  or of gross loans  at december   compared to million  or of gross loans  at december  at december   million in loans were on non accrual status  or of gross loans  compared to a balance of million  or of gross loans  at december  non accrual loans consist of loans or more days past due and impaired loans that are not past due 
there were no loans days or more delinquent and still accruing interest at december  or december  our impaired loans totaled million at december  compared to million at december  the difference in our non accrual balance and impaired loan balance at december  was a  real estate loan that was classified as a troubled debt restructuring during which is current and accruing interest  but still classified as impaired due to the below market interest rate on the loan 
the million decline in non accrual loans during was primarily the result of million of net loan charge offs 
at december   we had two loan relationships totaling million that were classified as troubled debt restructurings 
one of the relationships was an  real estate loan which was secured by real estate whose value was deficient based on a recent appraisal 
the relationship consisted of two restructured one to four family residential real estate loans to a borrower who was experiencing financial difficulty and granted concessions at renewal 
the value of the real estate supports  of the loan relationship 
the  loan was returned to accrual status during after a payment history was established while the remainder of the relationship was charged off 
the loan was current and accruing interest at december   but still classified as impaired 
a second loan relationship totaling  to a municipal sanitary and improvement district was restructured in to extend the maturity and lower the interest rate 
the loan was classified as non accrual and impaired at december  we did not have any loans classified as troubled debt restructurings at december  during  we had net loan charge offs of million as compared to million during the increased net loan charge offs in were primarily related to a previously identified and impaired construction loan totaling million  which experienced a significant decline in the appraised value of the collateral securing the loan 
while it was necessary to recognize the million loss associated with this decline in value  we continue to pursue the guarantor for payment due 
we also charged off the remaining million balance on a commercial agriculture loan after exhausting our collection attempts during the charge offs were primarily related to a commercial loan relationship that was liquidated in bankruptcy 
as part of our credit risk management  we continue to aggressively manage the loan portfolio to identify problem loans and have placed additional emphasis on commercial real estate and construction relationships 
we are aggressively working to resolve the remaining problem credits or move the nonperforming credits out of the loan portfolio 
during  real estate owned increased by million primarily as the result of foreclosure on loans that were nonperforming at december  the million increase in real estate owned was primarily the result of the foreclosure on a residential subdivision development as the company took possession of the real estate after the development slowed and the borrower was unable to comply with the contractual terms of the loan  as well as a loan settlement where the company took possession of a commercial real estate building 
the remaining increase in other real estate owned was from foreclosures on residential properties 
the company recorded  in valuation allowances against the cost basis of certain real estate owned assets to reflect subsequent declines in the market values of the real estate assets during the lower market values were based on updated appraisals that reflected continued declines in the estimated value of the real estate owned 
the company is currently marketing all of the properties in real estate owned 
many financial institutions  including us  have experienced an increase in nonperforming assets during recent years  as even well established business borrowers developed cash flow  profitability and other business related problems as a result of the economic slowdown 
we believe that our allowance for loan losses at december   was appropriate  however  there can be no assurances that losses will not exceed the estimated amounts 
while we believe that we use the best information available to determine the allowance for loan losses  unforeseen market conditions could result in adjustment to the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  net earnings could be significantly affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in establishing the allowance for loan losses 
further deterioration in the local economy or real estate values may create additional problem loans for us and require further adjustment to our allowance for loan losses 
liability distribution 
our primary ongoing sources of funds are deposits  fhlb borrowings  proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities and proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans and investment securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates and economic conditions 
total deposits decreased million to million at december   from million at december  total borrowings decreased million to million at december   from million at december  the decrease was primarily from the maturity of million of fhlb advances during and the prepayment of a million fhlb advance that converted to a variable rate 
offsetting some of the declines in outstanding fhlb advances was an increase in borrowings of million on our fhlb line of credit 
non interest bearing deposits at december  were million  or of deposits  compared to million  or  at december  money market and now deposit accounts were of our deposit portfolio and totaled million at december   compared to million  or  at december  savings accounts increased to million  or of deposits  at december   from million  or  at december  certificates of deposit decreased to million  or of deposits  at december   from million  or  at december  certificates of deposit at december   which were scheduled to mature in one year or less  totaled million 
historically  maturing deposits have generally remained with the bank and we believe that a significant portion of the deposits maturing in one year or less will remain with us upon maturity 
cash flows 
during  our cash and cash equivalents decreased by million 
our operating activities used net cash of million in primarily from funding the increase in origination volumes of one to four family residential real estate loans held for sale 
our loans held for sale balance was higher at december  than december  due to the increased refinancing demand we experienced in the fourth quarter of these loans have rate lock commitments and we completed the sales of these loans in early our investing activities provided net cash of million during as the net funds from our investment and loan portfolios were used to fund the increased balances of loans held for sale and to offset the lower fhlb borrowings and deposit balances 
our financing activities used net cash of million during  primarily from the maturity and prepayment of fhlb advances 
liquidity 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and investment securities available for sale 
the levels of these assets are dependent on the operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given year 
these liquid assets totaled million at december  and million at december  during periods in which we are not able to originate a sufficient amount of loans and or periods of high principal prepayments  we increase our liquid assets by investing in short term  high grade investments 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of our strategy 
excess funds are generally invested in short term investments 
in the event we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  additional funds are generally available through the use of fhlb advances  a line of credit with the fhlb  other borrowings or through sales of investment securities 
at december   we had outstanding fhlb advances of million and million in borrowings against our line of credit with the fhlb 
at december   we had collateral pledged to the fhlb that would allow us to borrow an additional million  subject to fhlb credit requirements and policies 
at december   we had no borrowings through the federal reserve discount window  while our borrowing capacity was million 
we also have various other fed funds agreements  both secured and unsecured  with correspondent banks totaling approximately million at december   which had no borrowings against at that time 
we had other borrowings of million at december   which included million of subordinated debentures and million in repurchase agreements 
the company has a million line of credit from an unrelated financial institution maturing on november   with an interest rate that adjusts daily based on the prime rate plus  but not less than 
this line of credit has covenants specific to capital and other financial ratios  which the company was in compliance with at december  the outstanding balance on the line of credit at december  was million  which was also included in other borrowings 
off balance sheet arrangements 
as a provider of financial services  we routinely issue financial guarantees in the form of financial and performance standby letters of credit 
standby letters of credit are contingent commitments issued by us generally to guarantee the payment or performance obligation of a customer to a third party 
while these standby letters of credit represent a potential outlay by us  a significant amount of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon 
we have recourse against the customer for any amount the customer is required to pay to a third party under a standby letter of credit 
the letters of credit are subject to the same credit policies  underwriting standards and approval process as loans made by us 
most of the standby letters of credit are secured  and in the event of nonperformance by the customers  we have the right to the underlying collateral  which could include commercial real estate  physical plant and property  inventory  receivables  cash and marketable securities 
the contract amount of these standby letters of credit  which represents the maximum potential future payments guaranteed by us  was million at december  at december   we had outstanding loan commitments  excluding standby letters of credit  of million 
we anticipate that sufficient funds will be available to meet current loan commitments 
these commitments consist of unfunded lines of credit and commitments to finance real estate loans 
capital 
the federal reserve has established capital requirements for bank holding companies which generally parallel the capital requirements for national banks under occ regulations 
the regulations provide that such standards will generally be applied on a consolidated rather than a bank only basis in the case of a bank holding company with more than million in total consolidated assets 
at december   we continued to maintain a sound leverage capital ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of 
as shown by the following table  our capital exceeded the minimum capital requirements at december  dollars in thousands actual actual required required amount percent amount percent leverage tier capital total risk based capital at december   landmark national bank continued to maintain a sound leverage ratio of and a total risk based capital ratio of 
as shown by the following table  landmark national bank s capital exceeded the minimum capital requirements at december  dollars in thousands actual actual required required amount percent amount percent leverage tier capital total risk based capital banks and bank holding companies are generally expected to operate at or above the minimum capital requirements 
the above ratios are well in excess of regulatory minimums and should allow us to operate without capital adequacy concerns 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of establishes a bank rating system based on the capital levels of banks 
as of december  and  we were rated well capitalized  which is the highest rating available under this capital based rating system 
we have million in trust preferred securities which  in accordance with current capital guidelines  has been included in tier capital as of december  cash distributions on the securities are payable quarterly  are deductible for income tax purposes and are included in interest expense in the consolidated financial statements 
dividends during the year ended december   we paid a quarterly cash dividend of per share to our stockholders 
additionally  we distributed a stock dividend for the tenth consecutive year in december the quarterly cash dividends of per share have been adjusted to give effect to the stock dividend 
the payment of dividends by any financial institution or its holding company is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations 
as described above  landmark national bank exceeded its minimum capital requirements under applicable guidelines as of december  the national bank act imposes limitations on the amount of dividends that a national bank may pay without prior regulatory approval 
generally  the amount is limited to the bank current year net earnings plus the adjusted retained earnings for the two preceding years 
as of december   approximately million was available to be paid as dividends to landmark bancorp by landmark national bank without prior regulatory approval 
additionally  our ability to pay dividends is limited by the subordinated debentures that are held by two business trusts that we control 
interest payments on the debentures must be paid before we pay dividends on our capital stock  including our common stock 
we have the right to defer interest payments on the debentures for up to consecutive quarters 
however  if we elect to defer interest payments  all deferred interest must be paid before we may pay dividends on our capital stock 
effects of inflation our consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation can be found in the increased cost of our operations because our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary and interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of inflation 
recent accounting developments in june  the fasb amended the existing guidance to asc topic  transfers and servicing 
the revision pertains to accounting for transfers of loans  participating interests in loans and other financial assets and reinforced the determination of whether a transferor has surrendered control over transferred financial assets 
that determination must consider the transferor s continuing involvements in the transferred financial asset  including all arrangements or agreements made contemporaneously with  or in contemplation of  the transfer  even if they were not entered into at the time of the transfer 
it added the term participating interest to establish specific conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale 
a qualifying participating interest requires each of the following conveys proportionate ownership rights with equal priority to each participating interest holder  involves no recourse other than standard representations and warranties to  or subordination by  any participating interest holder  and does not entitle any participating interest holder to receive cash before any other participating interest holder 
if the transfer does not meet those conditions  a transferor should account for the transfer as a sale only if it transfers the entire financial asset or a group of entire financial assets and surrenders control over the entire transferred assets in accordance with the conditions in asc  as amended 
the company adopted the guidance as of january  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosure about fair value measurements  which requires new disclosures related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
the asu requires new disclosures about the transfers into and out of levels and as well as requiring disclosures about level activity relating to purchases  sales  issuances and settlements 
the update also clarifies that fair value measurement disclosures should be at an appropriate level of disaggregation and that an appropriate class of assets and liabilities is often a subset of the line items in the financial statements 
the update also clarifies that disclosures should include the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value in levels and for both recurring and nonrecurring measurements 
the new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   except for disclosures on the level activity relating to purchases  sales  issuances and settlements which are effective for interim and annual periods after december  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued asu no 
 receivables topic disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses 
asu requires additional disclosures about the credit quality of a company s loans and the allowance for loan losses held against those loans 
companies will need to disaggregate new and existing disclosures based on how it develops its allowance for loan losses and how it manages credit exposures 
additional disclosure is also required about the credit quality indicators of loans by class at the end of the reporting period  the aging of past due loans  information about troubled debt restructurings  and significant purchases and sales of loans during the reporting period by class 
the new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our assets and liabilities are principally financial in nature and the resulting net interest income thereon is subject to changes in market interest rates and the mix of various assets and liabilities 
interest rates in the financial markets affect our decision on pricing our assets and liabilities which impacts our net interest income  a significant cash flow source for us 
as a result  a substantial portion of our risk management activities relates to managing interest rate risk 
our asset liability management committee monitors the interest rate sensitivity of our balance sheet using earnings simulation models and interest sensitivity gap analysis 
we have set policy limits of interest rate risk to be assumed in the normal course of business and monitor such limits through our simulation process 
in the past  we have been successful in meeting the interest rate sensitivity objectives set forth in our policy 
simulation models are prepared to determine the impact on net interest income for the coming twelve months  including using rates at december  and forecasting volumes for the twelve month projection 
this position is then subjected to a shift in interest rates of and basis points rising and basis points falling with an impact to our net interest income on a one year horizon as follows scenario s change in net interest income change in net interest income basis point rising basis point rising basis point falling asset liability management interest rate gap analysis is a common  though imperfect  measure of interest rate risk which measures the relative dollar amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which reprice within a specific time period  either through maturity or rate adjustment 
the gap is the difference between the amounts of such assets and liabilities that are subject to such repricing 
a positive gap for a given period means that the amount of interest earning assets maturing or otherwise repricing within that period exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or otherwise repricing during that same period 
in a rising interest rate environment  an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected  absent the effects of other factors  to experience a greater increase in the yield of its assets relative to the cost of its liabilities 
conversely  the cost of funds for an institution with a positive gap would generally be expected to decline less quickly than the yield on its assets in a falling interest rate environment 
changes in interest rates generally have the opposite effect on an institution with a negative gap 
following is our static gap schedule 
one to four family and consumer loans includes prepayment assumptions  while all other loans assume no prepayments 
the mortgage backed securities includes published prepayment assumptions  while all other investments assume no prepayments 
certificates of deposit reflect contractual maturities only 
money market accounts are rate sensitive and accordingly  a higher percentage of the accounts have been included as repricing immediately in the first period 
savings and now accounts are not as rate sensitive as money market accounts and for that reason a significant percentage of the accounts are reflected in the to year category 
we have been successful in meeting the interest sensitivity objectives set forth in our policy 
this has been accomplished primarily by managing the assets and liabilities while maintaining our traditional high credit standards
