item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes 
the matters addressed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations may contain certain forward looking statements involving risks and uncertainties 
overview enova systems believes it is a leading innovator of proprietary hybrid and electric drive systems propelling the alternative energy industry 
our core competencies are focused on the development and commercialization of power management and conversion systems for mobile applications 
enova applies unique enabling technologies in the areas of alternative energy propulsion systems for medium and heavy duty vehicles as well as power conditioning and management systems for distributed generation systems 
our products can be found in a variety of oem vehicles including those from navistar corporation  first auto works  freightliner customer chassis corporation  hyundai motor company and ford motor company  trucks and buses for smith electric vehicles  wright bus  optare plc and the us military  as well as digital power systems for edo and other major manufacturers 
we continue to support navistar in their efforts to maximize exposure in the hybrid school bus market 
we have been involved in large shows in st 
louis  mo  washington  dc and the principality of monaco as well as smaller venues throughout the midwest 
the exposure via shows and direct interface were aggressively pursued throughout in an effort to promote our drive systems production intent for medium and heavy duty applications 
some notable highlights of enova s accomplishments in are freightliner custom chassis corporation fccc  a division of daimler trucks north america  and enova entered into the final phase of our all electric commercial chassis development program 
the development program included collaboration and involved the engineering and integration of enova s kw all electric drive system technology into the mt walk in van chassis 
freightliner s highest volume mt chassis is used by a range of customers  including ups and federal express 
design  engineering  integration and testing activities were conducted at the fccc plant in gaffney  sc and the enova facility in torrance  ca 
the resulting integration of our all electric drive system into the mt chassis branded a new  fccc all electric product offering the fccc mt ev 
the mt ev chassis boasts a gvwr of  to  lbs 
the durable steel straight rail chassis frame reduces flex and bowing to minimize stress while carrying heavy payloads 
the quiet operation of the all electric mt ev also makes for an enjoyable driver experience 
the mt ev has a flat leaf spring front and rear suspension  allowing for a smooth  solid ride that minimizes cargo shifts on uneven road surfaces 
navistar  one of the largest manufacturer and marketer of medium and heavy trucks and mid range diesel engines  continued a relationship that started in by delivering systems in as part of an intended large scale deployment to hybrid school buses to school districts 
enova supports this commitment by engineering a post transmission hybrid drive system that integrates easily and non invasively 
several states and school districts have indicated expressed interest in expanding their hybrid school bus fleets 
as a result  enova delivered charge depleting systems to navistar in china s faw  the country s oldest indigenous automaker  also continued its commercial relationship with enova by integrating its pre transmission hybrid drive systems for the jiefang passenger hybrid bus 
these buses were first showcased at the beijing summer olympics and then in world s expo in shanghai 
enova delivered a total of pre transmission hybrid drive systems to faw in the us general services administration gsa extended its contract with enova as the exclusive supplier contract of the all electric step van 
gsa procures vehicles for government agencies and the armed forces 
under this contract  enova will coordinate the supply of mt ev all electric walk in step vans to gsa under the cargo vans category 
enova continues to benefit from federal fleet penetration via gsa with the 
table of contents smith electric vehicles smith newton product offering in the medium and heavy duty vehicle category 
the smith newton is another exclusive  all electric medium and heavy duty truck offering on the gsa product menu 
moreover  navistar continued to demonstrate its leadership in the american school bus market with its exclusive gsa contract to supply hybrid school buses 
enova is supplies hybrid electric drive systems to ic bus  an affiliated division of navistar 
enova and remy inc remy entered into an agreement to develop a new electric drive system based on enova s next generation omni controller and remy hvh motor 
remy is north america s largest independent manufacturer of advanced electric propulsion motors 
remy s patented design and assembly technology have been in production since and are currently powering vehicles around the world 
the optimized controller motor solution in development demonstrates the strong technology heritage and commitment to customers that enova continues to bring to the hybrid and all electric vehicle market 
smith electric vehicles na inc smith received a grant of million as part of the american recovery and reinvestment act of  a us department of energy program in the form of cost share grants for supporting the construction of us based manufacturing plants to produce batteries and electric drive components 
the program seeks to establish development  demonstration  evaluation  and education projects to accelerate the market introduction and penetration of advanced electric drive vehicles 
as production is ramps up  we anticipate the opportunity to continue to supply smith with our all electric vehicle drive systems that are used to power smith s newton trucks 
the company delivered a total of full systems and additional motor controller units of enova drive systems to its broad range of customers 
enova delivered all electric drive systems to smith in smith s newton product offering carries a gvwr of  lbs 
enova also delivered pre transmission hybrid drive systems to faw for their jiefang passenger hybrid bus and charge depleting bus systems to navistar during the year 
enova s product focus is digital power management and power conversion systems 
its software  and hardware manage and control the power that drives a vehicle 
they convert the power into the appropriate forms required by the vehicle or device and manage the flow of this energy to optimize efficiency and provide protection for both the system and its users 
our products and systems are the enabling technologies for power systems 
the latest state of the art technologies in hybrid and electric vehicles  fuel cell systems  all require some type of power management and conversion mechanism 
enova systems supplies these essential components 
enova drive systems are fuel neutral  meaning that they have the ability to utilize any type of fuel  including diesel  liquid natural gas or bio diesel fuels 
enova also performs significant research and development to augment and support others and our internal product development efforts 
our products are production engineered 
this means they are designed so they can be commercially produced ie  all formats and files are designed with manufacturability in mind  from the start 
for the automotive market  enova designs its products to iso manufacturing and quality standards 
we believe enova s redundancy of systems and rigorous quality standards result in high performance and reduced risk 
for every component and piece of hardware  there are detailed performance specifications 
each piece is tested and evaluated against these specifications  which enhances and confirms the value of the systems to oem customers 
our engineering services focus on system integration support for product sales and custom product design 
in light of our efforts to grow market share in our target markets and penetrate emerging ones  the company continues to acknowledge the principal barrier to commercialization of our drive systems is cost 
the cost of engineering proprietary software and hardware for our drive systems is high because economies of production in specialized hybrid drive system component parts  batteries  and vehicle integration have not been achieved 
therefore  the cost of our products and engineering services are currently higher than our gasoline and diesel competitor counterparts 
we also believe maturation into commercialization of our drive systems will result in decreases to our long run average costs of materials and services as volume increases over time 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  contingencies  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  including current and anticipated worldwide economic conditions  both in general and specifically in relation to the hybrid and electric vehicle markets  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
we believe the following critical accounting policies necessitated that significant judgments and estimates be used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
we have reviewed these policies with our audit committee 
revenue recognition we generally recognizes revenue at the time of shipment when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  performance of our obligation is complete  our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and we are reasonably assured of collection 
if a loss is anticipated on any contract  a provision for the entire loss is made immediately 
determination of these criteria  in some cases  requires management s judgment 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine that these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
the company also recognizes engineering and construction contract revenues using the percentage of completion method  based primarily on contract costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs 
customer furnished materials  labor  and equipment  and in certain cases subcontractor materials  labor  and equipment  are included in revenues and cost of revenues when management believes that the company is responsible for the ultimate acceptability of the project 
contracts are segmented between types of services  such as engineering and construction  and accordingly  gross margin related to each activity is recognized as those separate services are rendered 
changes to total estimated contract costs or losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which they are determined 
claims against customers are recognized as revenue upon settlement 
revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed are classified as current assets under contract work in progress 
amounts billed to clients in excess of revenues recognized to date are classified as current liabilities on contracts 
changes in project performance and conditions  estimated profitability  and final contract settlements may result in future revisions to engineering and development contract costs and revenue 
warranty we warrant our products against defects in materials and workmanship arising during normal use 
we service warranty claims directly through our customer service department 
our warranty periods generally range up to eighteen months 
we estimate and recognize product warranty costs  which are included in cost of sales  as we sell the related products 
warranty costs are forecasted based on the best available information  primarily historical claims experience and the expected costs 
we have not made any material changes in our warranty reserve methodology during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in assumptions we use to calculate the warranty reserve 
however  actual claim costs may differ from the amounts estimated 
if a significant product defect were to be discovered  our financial statements may be materially impacted 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is the company s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the company s existing accounts receivable  however  changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future 
past due balances over days and other higher risk amounts are reviewed individually for collectibility 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
in addition  the company maintains a general reserve for all invoices by applying a 
table of contents percentage based on the age category 
account balances are charged against the allowance after all collection efforts have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
inventory inventories include material  labor  and manufacturing overhead are priced at the lower of cost or market utilizing the first in  first out fifo cost flow assumption 
we maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on hand and standard cost for each product  including purchased components  subassemblies and finished goods 
we maintain the integrity of perpetual inventory records through periodic physical counts of quantities on hand ie  cycle counts 
finished goods are reported as inventories until the point of transfer to the customer 
generally  title transfer is documented in the terms of sale 
inventory reserve we maintain an allowance against inventory for the potential future obsolescence or excess inventory 
a substantial decrease in expected demand for our products  or decreases in our selling prices could lead to excess or overvalued inventories and could require us to substantially increase our allowance for excess inventory 
if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of revenues in the period the revision is made 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets  which range from three to seven years using the straight line method for financial statement purposes 
the company uses other depreciation methods generally  accelerated depreciation methods for tax purposes where appropriate 
amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements 
repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
expenditures that increase the value or productive capacity of assets are capitalized 
when property and equipment are retired  sold  or otherwise disposed of  the asset s cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in operations 
impairment of long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of its long lived assets periodically in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc  impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company reviews the carrying value of property and equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of assets 
the factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results  trends  and prospects  as well as the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition  and other economic factors 
long lived assets that management commits to sell or abandon are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
intangible assets intangible assets consist of patents 
intangible assets with an indefinite life are not amortized 
intangible assets with a definite life are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging up to years 
intangible assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
stock based compensation the company calculates stock based compensation expense in accordance with fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc 
this pronouncement requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options  to be based on estimated fair values 
the company s determination of estimated fair value of share based awards utilizes the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model is affected by the company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding certain highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the company s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards as well as actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
deferred income taxes we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
we determined that we 
table of contents may not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  thus a valuation allowance was recorded against our deferred tax assets 
these accounting policies were applied consistently for all periods presented 
our operating results would be affected if other alternatives were used 
information about the impact on our operating results is included in the footnotes to our financial statements 
research and development research  development  and engineering costs are expensed in the period incurred 
costs of significantly altering existing technology are expensed as incurred 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition milestone method topic milestone method of revenue recognition  or asu asu allows the milestone method as an acceptable revenue recognition methodology when an arrangement includes substantive milestones 
asu provides a definition of substantive milestone  and should be applied regardless of whether the arrangement includes single or multiple deliverables or units of accounting 
asu is limited to transactions involving milestones relating to research and development deliverables 
asu also includes enhanced disclosure requirements about each arrangement  individual milestones and related contingent consideration  information about substantive milestones  and factors considered in the determination 
asu is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of this standard did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued asu providing authoritative guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures 
the provisions of the guidance require new disclosures related to transfers in and out of levels and classifications as well as provisions requiring a reconciliation of the activity in level recurring fair value measurements 
existing disclosures also were expanded to include level fair value measurement valuation techniques and inputs 
the guidance is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures for level activity which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of the guidance did not  and is not expected to  have a material impact on our business  financial position  results of operations or liquidity in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements a consensus of the fasb eitf  or asu asu changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include tangible products and software elements 
the amendments of this update provide additional guidance on how to determine which software  if any  relating to the tangible product also would be excluded from the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance 
the amendments in this update also provide guidance on how a vendor should allocate arrangement consideration to deliverables in an arrangement that includes tangible products and software as well as arrangements that have deliverables both included and excluded from the scope of software revenue recognition guidance 
this standard is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  the adoption is not expected to have an effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb eitf  or asu asu will separate multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this update establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
the amendments of this update will replace the term fair value in the revenue allocation guidance with selling price to clarify that the allocation of revenue is based on entity specific assumptions rather than assumptions of a marketplace participant 
the amendments of this update will eliminate the residual method of allocation and require that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
the amendments in this update will require that a vendor determine its best estimated selling price in a manner consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis 
this standard is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  the company does not believe that the adoption of the pronouncement will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents results of operations years ended december  and net revenues 
net revenues were  for the year ended december   representing an increase of  or from net revenues of  during the same period in revenues in the current year benefited from us government grant programs  resulting in increased sales for fulfillment of orders from smith electric vehicles and navistar inc smith electric vehicles  navistar and faw comprised  and of our revenues  respectively

the company continued its strategy to concentrate support to core customers in in our migration to a first tier production company  recording sales with several oems  including navistar  freightliner and smith electric vehicles in the united states and faw in china 
although we have seen indications for future production growth  there can be no assurance there will be continuing demand for our products and services 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december   representing an increase of  or 
cost of revenues increased in compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the increase in revenue 
the improvement in cost of revenues is primarily attributable to our strategy to concentrate on higher volume production orders and our continuing focus on manufacturing and inventory processes that resulted in tighter control over production costs 
cost of revenues consists of component and material costs  direct labor costs  integration costs and overhead related to manufacturing our products as well as warranty accruals and inventory valuation reserve amounts 
product development costs incurred in the performance of engineering development contracts for the us government and private companies are charged to cost of sales 
our customers continue to require additional integration and support services to customize  integrate and evaluate our products 
we believe that a portion of these costs are initial  one time costs for these customers and anticipate similar costs to be incurred with respect to new customers as we pursue a greater market share 
typically we do not incur these same types of costs for customers who have been using our products for over one year 
gross margin 
the gross margin for the year ended december  was compared to in the prior year  an increase of 
the improvement in gross margin is primarily attributable to our focus on key customer production contracts  maturity of our supply chain  and efficiencies gained through focus on manufacturing and inventory processes that resulted in tighter controls over production costs

historically cash flows from operations have not been sufficient to meet our obligations and we have had to raise funds through several financing transactions 
at least until we reach breakeven volume in sales and develop and or acquire the capability to manufacture and sell our products profitably  we will need to continue to rely on cash from external financing sources 
our operations during the year ended december  were financed by product sales and working capital reserves 
as of december   the company had  of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
on june   the company entered into a secured a revolving credit facility with a financial institution for  which was secured by a  certificate of deposit 
the facility is for a period of years and months from july  to december  the interest rate on a drawdown from the facility is the certificate of deposit rate plus with interest payable monthly and the principal due at maturity 
the financial institution also renewed the  irrevocable letter of credit for the full amount of the credit facility in favor of sunshine distribution lp  with respect to the lease of the company s corporate headquarters at west th street  torrance  california 
net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  cash used in operating activities was primarily affected by the cost of revenue  r d  personnel and general operating costs  which were partially mitigated by our utilization of existing inventory balances to fulfill customer orders in non cash items included expenses for stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization  inventory reserve  impairment loss  and issuance of common stock for services 
in  in conjunction with the reduction of our credit facility  as explained above  we redeemed a certificate of deposit for  which included a  irrevocable letter of credit for the full amount of a credit facility in favor of sunshine distribution lp  with respect to the lease of the company s corporate headquarters
