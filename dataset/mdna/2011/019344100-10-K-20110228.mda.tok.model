table of contents part i item business allied nevada gold corp 
is a mining and exploration company which produces gold as a primary product and silver as a by product 
allied nevada currently operates its wholly owned hycroft mine  located west of winnemucca  nevada 
the hycroft mine hosts a current proven and probable mineral reserve of million ounces of gold and million ounces of silver 
the property resides on an aggregate land position of approximately square miles 
the mine reopened in  and in  the company began an accelerated mining plan for its oxide heap leach operation involving the purchase of a larger capacity mining fleet  essentially tripling the mining rate over a three year period 
the expansion is in progress and will increase expected annual production from  ounces of gold in to over  ounces of gold in with the accelerated mining rate taken into account  the reserve is sufficient to support a year mine life 
the company has completed a scoping study that includes a milling option for processing sulfide ore and higher grade oxide ores 
the company plans to issue an initial feasibility study in for this milling option 
the company intends to continue exploration programs with a goal of extending the mine life at hycroft and identifying potential development opportunities at outside exploration properties 
allied nevada s corporate headquarters is located at gateway drive  suite  reno  nevada in this report  allied nevada  the company  our and we refer to allied nevada gold corp 
and its subsidiaries 
formation of allied nevada allied nevada gold corp 
was incorporated under the laws of delaware on september  and until may  we were a wholly owned subsidiary of vista gold corp 
vista  a corporation incorporated under the laws of the yukon territory  canada 
we commenced operations on may   following vista s transfer to us of its nevada based mining properties and related assets  along with cash  and the transfer to us by carl pescio and janet pescio the pescios of their interests in certain nevada mining properties and related assets 
in this document  we sometimes use the term vista nevada assets to refer to  vista s nevada based mining properties and related assets that were transferred to us pursuant to the arrangement agreement that we entered into with vista and the pescios on september   as amended 
before the arrangement agreement transactions were completed  we had no properties or property interests  were not yet conducting business operations and had no shareholders other than vista 
the shares of allied nevada common stock began trading on may   on the nyse amex  and the toronto stock exchange tsx 
in july  allied nevada completed a private placement for gross proceeds of cdn  we issued  units consisting of one common share and common share purchase warrant 
the proceeds of the private placement were for the exploration and development of the hycroft mine and for general corporate purposes 
in september  the board of directors approved the re opening of the hycroft mine hycroft development program 
the hycroft development program involved re opening the hycroft mine and heap leach facilities which had been placed on a care and maintenance program due to low gold prices since in april  we completed a financing and issued  common shares for gross proceeds of cdn  proceeds from the financing were to fund the reactivation of the hycroft mine and to continue oxide and sulfide exploration activities at hycroft 
in august  we completed a cross border financing and issued  common shares for gross proceeds of cdn  proceeds from the financing were to fund an expanded oxide and sulfide exploration program at hycroft and general corporate purposes 
in june   we completed a cross border financing and issued  common shares for aggregate proceeds of cdn  proceeds from the financing were to satisfy initial capital needs for the accelerated oxide expansion  to fund exploration programs and to complete an initial milling feasibility study related to the development of the sulfide resource 
segment information our operating segments are the hycroft mine  exploration properties  and other 
the hycroft mine operating segment contains the exploration and operational activities at our wholly owned hycroft mine located in nevada 
the exploration properties segment contains the exploration and development activities on the company s advanced exploration properties and other exploration properties 
the other operating segment primarily contains the corporate overhead functions of the company 
please see note to our consolidated financial statements for information related to our business segments 
general description of the business of allied nevada allied nevada owns the hycroft mine  hasbrouck  mountain view  three hills and wildcat projects  the maverick springs project a joint venture with silver standard resources inc silver standard  the pony creek elliot dome project  and the 
table of contents exploration rights to approximately other exploration properties 
for more information related to each of these properties  see part i item properties 
all of these properties are located in the state of nevada 
allied nevada operates the wholly owned hycroft mine  which is located miles west of winnemucca  nevada 
the hycroft mine is an open pit  run of mine and crushed ore heap leach gold mine that also produces silver as a byproduct of the gold recovery process 
we intend to mine all currently identified ore reserves by open pit methods with a typical drill  blast  load  and haul cycle from six pits  the brimstone  bay  central  cut  camel and boneyard pits 
currently  the majority of the ore grade material placed on the leach pad is run of mine with a small percentage being crushed 
ore is selectively crushed based on ore type and grade 
the pregnant solution is processed using a merrill crowe zinc precipitation process merrill crowe process and a carbon in column leach solution recovery process cic process 
in addition to operating the hycroft mine  allied nevada is engaged in the evaluation  acquisition  exploration and advancement of gold exploration and development projects in the state of nevada 
we expect to continue our focus on gold project acquisition and development in the future 
principal products allied nevada sold  ounces of gold and  ounces of silver during we generally sell our gold at the prevailing market price during the month in which the gold is delivered to the customer 
we recognize revenue from a sale when the price is determinable  the gold has been delivered  the title has been transferred to the customer and collection of the sales price is reasonably assured 
most of our revenue arises from the sale of refined gold in the international market 
the end product at our gold operations  however  is generally dor bars 
dor is an alloy consisting of gold  silver and other metals 
dor is sent to refiners to produce bullion that meets the required market standard of pure gold 
under the terms of our refining agreements  the dor bars are refined for a fee  and our share of the refined gold and the separately recovered silver are credited to our account or delivered to our buyers 
during  our gold revenues were more than times our silver revenues 
as such  we consider gold to be a principal product and silver to be a byproduct of the gold recovery process 
gold uses 
gold has two main categories of use fabrication and investment 
fabricated gold has a variety of end uses  including jewelry  electronics  dentistry  industrial and decorative uses  medals  medallions and official coins 
gold investors buy gold bullion  official coins and jewelry 
gold supply 
the supply of gold consists of a combination of current production from mining and the draw down of existing stocks of gold held by governments  financial institutions  industrial organizations and private individuals 
based on public information total world gold supply increased only for for the years through  global mine production has  on average  accounted for approximately of the annual supply of gold 
increased mine supply and recycling along with reduced producer de hedging accounted for a sizable increase year over year 
these gains were partially offset by net official sector sales  which decreased to tons in compared with the average annual sales over the last five years ending of tons 
according to the world gold council  gold demand in reached a year high  up year over year  and marginally above the previous peak of despite a increase in the annual average price level between and annual demand for gold jewelry rose  investment demand  comprising bar and coin demand  etfs and similar products  remained stable in  down just from and demand for gold used in technology was higher than in india was the strongest growth market in with total annual consumer demand registering growth of relative to  which was largely driven by the jewelry sector 
china was the strongest market for investment demand growth with demand for small bars and coins increasing compared with gold prices 
the price of gold is volatile and is affected by many factors beyond our control  such as the sale or purchase of gold by central banks and financial institutions  inflation or deflation  fluctuation in the value of the us dollar and foreign currencies  global and regional demand and the political and economic conditions of major gold producing countries throughout the world 
the following table presents the annual high  low and average afternoon fixing prices for gold over the past ten years  expressed in us dollars per ounce  on the london bullion market

table of contents on february   the afternoon fixing price for gold on the london bullion market was  per ounce 
business strategy our business plan was developed with the overriding goal of maximizing shareholder value through the operation of the hycroft mine  the exploration and development of our mineral properties  and through strategic partnerships 
to achieve this goal  our business plan focuses on three strategic areas hycroft mine mine operations hycroft expansion projects hycroft exploration drilling program advanced exploration properties mergers and acquisitions hycroft mine mine operations the hycroft mine is located miles west of winnemucca  nevada along the border of humboldt and pershing counties  and covers approximately  acres of mineral rights 
the mine can be accessed by various routes year round 
however  primary access is by an all weather  maintained gravel road from the town of winnemucca 
our operating objective at the hycroft mine is to mine the deposit in a profitable  safe  and environmentally friendly manner 
to attain this goal  we have focused on recruiting and retaining experienced executives  managers  and employees 
our team has extensive experience in managing and operating mines utilizing the specific mining and processing methods used by the company 
we believe this team has identified the appropriate technologies and developed the appropriate production management  health and safety programs and environmental management  monitoring  and protection programs 
operations in  hycroft successfully completed its second full year of operations  achieving its stated operating goals 
the mine moved million tons of material  including million tons of ore placed on the leach pad at average grades of opt gold and opt silver  placing  contained ounces of gold  ounces of recoverable gold and  contained ounces of silver  ounces of recoverable silver 
the mine completed a million square foot expansion of its brimstone leach pad in  increased the flow rate through the merrill crowe plant from  to  gallons per minute gpm and began work on the construction of a new truck shop capable of handling larger capacity mining equipment 
the improvements were all in connection with the ramping up of the accelerated oxide mine plan  announced in early hycroft expansion projects accelerated oxide heap leach plan the company began implementing an accelerated oxide mine plan in mid with a goal of tripling the mining rate utilizing a larger capacity mining fleet 
by the end of  one hydraulic shovel and three of the ton trucks were in operation 
the accelerated oxide mine plan that we began implementing in  is being phased in over the next two years  with gold production being expected to increase from approximately  ounces in to over  ounces of gold in and an expectation that it will peak at over  ounces in each of and mill project scoping study the company completed a milling scoping study in april  designed to extract the large sulfide resource and additional oxide resources associated with the sulfides 
this study was subsequently updated in september of scoping study 
the scoping study envisions an  ore ton per day tpd milling and heap leach operation 
this updated scoping study concludes that average annual production of approximately  ounces of gold and million ounces of silver could be produced from the combined  tpd milling operation and  tpd heap leach operation 
the estimated capital cost was expected to be billion for the milling and flotation process facility  additional leach pads  mining equipment and other ancillary infrastructure 
the milling facility would be comprised of one or two lines  with each consisting of a primary crusher  semi autogenous grinding mill  two ball mills and a flotation circuit and could be implemented in stages in order to manage capital expenditures over the first few years of the project 

table of contents the company expects to complete an update to the scoping study in march based on the favorable result of the milling scoping study and the subsequent updates  the company is preparing an initial feasibility study  currently expected to be released in the third quarter of for detailed information regarding the scoping study see part i item properties operating properties hycroft mine mill project scoping study 
hycroft exploration drilling program in  allied nevada successfully completed its drill campaign with primary goals of improving the confidence level of other mineralized material and providing data for engineering and metallurgical studies in support of the initial milling feasibility study that the company expects to issue in the third quarter of in the first quarter of  drilling is expected to utilize a fleet of seven to ten drill rigs 
for the remainder of the year  we expect to reduce the drill fleet to two or three rigs which will be directed toward step out drilling and testing geophysical anomalies around the hycroft property with a goal of expanding the resource base 
in  the company continued to define sulfide gold and silver mineralization as part of the hycroft exploration drilling program 
the drilling was also used to collect samples for ongoing metallurgical work and pit slope analyses in preparation of an initial feasibility study for a milling scenario 
results of this exploration campaign are expected to be released in the first quarter of as part of the company s annual reserve reporting 
any expansion of the hycroft mine necessary to exploit any additional reserves that may be established through our hycroft exploration drilling program that are not located within our current mine plan will require us to obtain all permits  approvals and consents of regulatory agencies responsible for the use and development of mines in nevada 
for further discussions concerning these programs  see part i item properties operating properties hycroft mine hycroft mine exploration 
advanced exploration properties our advanced exploration properties portfolio consists of six advanced properties  being hasbrouck  mountain view  maverick springs a joint venture interest with silver standard  three hills  wildcat  and pony creek elliot dome 
the company commenced drilling activities on hasbrouck in with the goal of developing the property 
the company intends to publish an updated resource estimate and preliminary economic assessment in for hasbrouck 
exploration drilling will continue through the first half of with a goal of delineating and expanding the mineralization 
the resource model and economic analyses will then be updated during the second half of the year 
the company is developing exploration programs at other advanced exploration properties for with the goal of confirming or establishing mineralization at these properties 
for further discussions concerning our exploration properties  please see information concerning each property under part i item properties 
other exploration properties the company has approximately other exploration properties in the state of nevada 
the company intends to pursue strategic options for these exploration properties that could include development through exploration programs  joint ventures  royalty agreements  or the sale or release of the property 
mergers and acquisitions we routinely review merger and acquisition opportunities 
our primary focus will be on those opportunities involving precious metal production or near term production with a secondary focus on other resource based opportunities 
potential acquisition targets would include private and public companies or individual properties 
although our preference would be for acquisition candidates located in the united states  allied nevada will consider opportunities located in other countries where the geopolitical risk is acceptably low 
financial information included in this document this annual report on form k includes financial and other information for the years ended december  prior to may   we were still a wholly owned subsidiary of vista 
consistent with our past filings  the financial statements  related discussion and analysis and other financial information in this document were prepared as it relates to the subsidiaries of vista that held nevada based mining properties and related assets that were transferred to allied nevada as part of the arrangement agreement 
in our filings prior to the completion of the arrangement agreement  we referred to these subsidiaries as vista gold corp 
nevada exploration properties or vista nevada 
our financial statements do not include any historical financial information on the property interests acquired by allied nevada from the pescios 
accordingly  the financial statements for periods prior to the completion of the arrangement agreement as presented in this annual report on form k are those of vista nevada  as so termed  and are not indicative of results of operations of allied nevada as it is now constituted

to the extent necessary  allied nevada uses consultants with specific skills to assist with various aspects of its project evaluation drill program management  expansion and feasibility studies  due diligence  acquisition initiatives  corporate governance and property management 
competition allied nevada competes with other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of gold properties 
there is competition for the limited number of gold acquisition opportunities  some of which is with companies having substantially greater financial resources than allied nevada 
as a result  allied nevada may have difficulty acquiring attractive gold projects at reasonable prices 
allied nevada also competes with other mining companies for skilled employees and from time to time certain production inputs have been in short supply 
shortages of production supplies rarely lead to serious issues for the operation  but would require us to either substitute with lower quality supplies or to ship these supplies from longer distances 
these substitutions and changes would therefore result in minor production inefficiencies or additional costs 
we have not experienced any material shortages in production inputs of this nature 
management of allied nevada believes that no single company has sufficient market power to affect the price or supply of gold in the world market 
allied nevada does not have any major customers for its gold production that would adversely affect the company should such customers fail

government regulation of mining related activities property interests and mining claims our exploration activities are conducted in the state of nevada 
mineral interests may be owned in nevada by a the united states  b the state itself  or c private parties 
where prospective mineral properties are owned by private parties  or by the state  some type of property acquisition agreement is necessary in order for allied nevada to explore or develop such property 
generally  these agreements take the form of long term mineral leases under which we acquire the right to explore and develop the property in exchange for periodic cash payments during the exploration and development phase and a royalty  usually expressed as a percentage of gross production or net profits derived from the leased properties if and when mines on the properties are brought into production 
other forms of acquisition agreements are exploration agreements coupled with options to purchase and joint venture agreements 
where prospective mineral properties are held by the united states  mineral rights may be acquired through the location of unpatented mineral claims upon unappropriated federal land 
if the statutory requirements for the location of a mining claim are met  the locator obtains a valid possessory right  subject to the paramount title of the united states  to develop and produce minerals from the claim conditioned upon applicable environmental reviews and permitting programs 
federal unpatented mining claims must be maintained through filing notices of intent to maintain the claims with the county and the completion of annual assessment work or  since  payment of federal maintenance fees 
the right can be transferred as prescribed under law and  provided that the locator is able to prove the discovery of valuable  locatable minerals on the claims and to meet all other applicable federal and state requirements and procedures pertaining to the location and maintenance of federal unpatented mining claims  the claim locator would have the right to prosecute a patent application to secure fee title to the claim from the federal government 
the right to pursue a patent  however  has been subject to a moratorium since october  through federal legislation restricting the us bureau of land management blm from accepting any new mineral patent applications 
additionally  proposed federal legislation has been introduced to amend the federal mining law pursuant to which  if adopted  would  among other changes  remove the right to obtain a patent and replace the claim location process with a leasing program 
mining claims are subject to the same risk of defective title that is common to all real property interests 
additionally  mining claims are self initiated and self maintained and therefore  possess some unique vulnerabilities not associated with other types of property interests 
it is impossible to ascertain the validity of unpatented mining claims solely from an examination of the public real estate records and  therefore  it can be difficult or impossible to confirm that all of the requisite steps have been followed for location and maintenance of a claim 
if the validity of a patented mining claim is challenged by the blm or the us forest service on the grounds that mineralization has not been demonstrated  the claimant has the burden of proving the present economic feasibility of mining minerals located thereon 
such a challenge might be raised when a patent application is submitted  when the government seeks to include the land in an area to be dedicated to another use  or when a party files a permit application or plan of operation to develop the mining claims 

table of contents reclamation we are required to mitigate long term environmental impacts by stabilizing  contouring  resloping and revegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing operations are completed 
these reclamation efforts will be conducted in accordance with detailed plans  which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies 
allied nevada s principal reclamation liability is at the hycroft mine 
at december   we have posted reclamation bonds totaling million 
these reclamation bonds are supported by an insurance backed financial assurance program and a surety bond 
please see note restricted cash to our consolidated financial statements for more information 
in january   the reclamation surety for the hycroft mine was increased to a total of million 
this increase covers the reclamation liability associated with the increased exploration activities  brimstone and central pit expansions  and a consolidation and expansion of the numerous waste rock facilities into larger  well defined areas 
government regulation mining operations and exploration activities are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations in the united states  which govern prospecting  development  mining  production  exports  taxes  labor standards  occupational health  waste disposal  protection of the environment  mine safety  hazardous substances and other matters 
we have obtained or have pending applications for those licenses  permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct our exploration and other programs 
we believe that allied nevada is in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining  health  safety and environmental statutes and the regulations passed thereunder in nevada and the united states and in any other jurisdiction in which we will operate 
we are not aware of any current orders or directions relating to allied nevada with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations 
environmental regulation our gold projects are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations governing protection of the environment 
these laws are continually changing and  in general  are becoming more restrictive 
it is our policy to conduct business in a way that safeguards public health and the environment 
we believe that allied nevada s operations are and will be conducted in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
changes to current state or federal laws and regulations in nevada  where we operate currently  or in jurisdictions where we may operate in the future  could require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and or reclamation costs 
although we are unable to predict what additional legislation  if any  might be proposed or enacted  additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of our projects 
during   and  there were no material environmental incidents or non compliance with any applicable environmental regulations on the properties now held by allied nevada 
allied nevada did not incur material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities during   or and does not expect to incur any such expenditures in mine safety and health administration regulations allied nevada considers health  safety and environmental stewardship to be a core value for the company and received a sentinels of safety award for in allied nevada has a mandatory mine safety and health program including employee training  risk management  workplace inspection  emergency response  accident investigation and program auditing 
the company considers this program to be essential at all levels to ensure that employees and the company conduct themselves in an environment of exemplary health  safety and environmental governance 
our operations and exploration properties are subject to regulation by the federal mine safety and health administration msha under the federal mine safety and health act of the mine act 
msha inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues various citations and orders when it believes a violation has occurred under the mine act 
following passage of the mine improvement and new emergency response act of  msha significantly increased the numbers of citations and orders charged against mining operations 
the dollar penalties assessed for citations issued has also generally increased in recent years 
in accordance with the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the act made law in july  which requires certain disclosures by companies required to file periodic reports under the securities exchange act of  as amended  the company has provided disclosure as required by the act in part i item b

risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information contained in this form k before deciding to invest or to continue holding your investment in our common stock 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing us or otherwise associated with an investment in our common stock 
additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also adversely affect our business 
we have attempted to identify the major factors that could cause differences between actual and planned or expected results  and we have 
table of contents included these material risk factors 
if any of the following risks actually happen  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
in this case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose part or all of your investment 
see note regarding forward looking statements above 
the market prices of gold and silver are volatile 
low gold and silver prices could result in decreased revenues  decreased net income or losses and decreased cash flows  and may negatively affect our business 
gold and silver are commodities 
their prices fluctuate and are affected by many factors beyond our control  including interest rates  expectations regarding inflation  speculation  currency values  central bank activities  governmental decisions regarding the disposal of precious metals stockpiles  global and regional demand and production  political and economic conditions and other factors 
the prices of gold and silver on the london bullion market on december  were  per ounce for gold and per ounce for silver 
the prices of gold and silver may decline in the future 
any decline in our realized gold or silver price adversely impacts our revenues  net income and cash flows  particularly in light of our strategy of not engaging in hedging transactions with respect to gold 
in addition  sustained lower gold or silver prices can reduce revenues further through production declines due to cessation of the mining of deposits  or portions of deposits  that have become uneconomic at the then prevailing gold or silver price  reduce or eliminate the profit that we currently expect from ore stockpiles and ore on leach pads  halt or delay the development of new projects  cause us to recognize an impairment to the carrying values of mineral properties  reduce funds available for exploration with the result that depleted reserves may not be replaced  and reduce existing reserves by removing ores from reserves that can no longer be economically processed at prevailing prices 
the estimation of the ultimate recovery of gold and silver contained within the hycroft heap leach pad inventory and that of any future heap leach mines  although based on standard industry sampling and estimating methods is subjective 
actual recoveries can be expected to vary from estimations 
the hycroft mine utilizes the heap leach process to extract gold and silver from ore 
the heap leach process is a process of extracting gold and silver by placing ore on an impermeable pad and applying a diluted cyanide solution that dissolves a portion of the contained gold and silver  which are then recovered in metallurgical processes 
we use several integrated steps in the process of extracting gold and silver to estimate the metal content of ore placed on the leach pad 
although we refine our estimates as appropriate at each step in the process  the final amounts are not determined until a third party smelter converts the dor and determines final ounces of gold and silver available for sale 
we then review this end result and reconcile it to the estimates we developed and used throughout the production process 
based on this review  we adjust our estimation procedures when appropriate 
due to the complexity of the estimation process and the number of steps involved  among other things  actual recoveries can vary from estimates  and the amount of the variation could be significant and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
each of these factors also applies to any future development of properties not yet in production 
in the case of mines that we may develop in the future  we will not have the benefit of actual experience in our estimates with respect to those mines  and there is a greater likelihood that actual results will vary from the estimates 
reserve and resource calculations are estimates only  and are subject to uncertainty due to factors including metal prices  inherent variability of the ore and recoverability of metal in the mining process 
the calculation of mineral reserves  mineral resources and grading are merely estimates and depend upon geological interpretation and statistical inferences or assumptions drawn from drilling and sampling analysis  which may prove to be unpredictable 
there is a degree of uncertainty attributable to the calculation of reserves  resources and corresponding grades 
until reserves and resources are actually mined and processed  the quantity of ore and grades must be considered as an estimate only 
in addition  the quantity of reserves and resources and ore may vary depending on metal prices 
any material change in the quantity of reserves  resources  mineralization  grade or stripping ratio may affect the economic viability of our properties 
in addition  there can be no assurance that gold recoveries or other metal recoveries in small scale laboratory tests will be duplicated in larger scale tests under on site conditions or during production 
compliance with current and future government regulations may cause us to incur significant costs 
our operations are subject to extensive federal and state legislation governing matters such as mine safety  occupational health  labor standards  prospecting  exploration  production  exports  toxic substances  explosives  management of natural resources  price controls  land use  water use  air emissions  waste disposal  environmental review and taxes 
compliance with this and other legislation could require us to make significant capital outlays 
the enactment of new legislation or more stringent enforcement of 
table of contents current legislation may increase costs  which could have a negative effect on our financial position 
we cannot make assurances that we will be able to adapt to these regulatory developments on a timely or cost effective basis 
violations of these laws  regulations and other regulatory requirements could lead to substantial fines  penalties or other sanctions  including possible shut downs of the hycroft mine or future operations  as applicable 
our operations are subject to numerous governmental permits that are difficult to obtain and we may not be able to obtain or renew all of the permits we require  or such permits may not be timely obtained or renewed 
in the ordinary course of business we are required to obtain and renew governmental permits for our operations  including in connection with our mining and exploration plans at the hycroft mine and our exploration plan at hasbrouck 
obtaining or renewing the necessary governmental permits is a complex and time consuming process involving costly undertakings by us 
the duration and success of our efforts to obtain and renew permits are contingent upon many variables not within our control  including the interpretation of applicable requirements implemented by the permitting authority and intervention by third parties in any required environmental review 
we may not be able to obtain or renew permits that are necessary to our operations on a timely basis or at all  and the cost to obtain or renew permits may exceed our estimates 
failure to comply with the terms of our permits may result in injunctions  fines  suspension or revocation of permits and other penalties 
there can be no assurance that we have been or will at all times be in full compliance with all of the terms of our permits or that we have all required permits 
the costs and delays associated with compliance with these permits and with the permitting process could stop us from proceeding with the operation or development of a property or increase the costs of development or production and may materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we may not achieve our production estimates and our operating costs may be higher than our estimates 
we prepare estimates of future production and operating costs for our operations 
we develop our estimates based on  among other things  mining experience  reserve and resource estimates  assumptions regarding ground conditions and physical characteristics of ores such as hardness and presence or absence of certain metallurgical characteristics and estimated rates and costs of mining and processing 
all of our estimates are subject to numerous uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control 
our actual production may be lower than our production estimates and our actual operating costs may be higher than our operating cost estimates 
we cannot be certain that our future exploration and development activities will be commercially successful 
substantial expenditures are required to further explore our hycroft and hasbrouck properties  to establish reserves and resources through drilling and analysis  to develop metallurgical processes to extract metal from the ore and  in the case of new properties or the expansion of our existing projects  to develop the mining and processing facilities and infrastructure at any site chosen for mining 
we cannot provide assurance that any reserves or resources discovered will be in sufficient quantities to justify commercial operations or that the funds required for development can be obtained on a timely basis 
a number of factors  including costs  actual mineralization  consistency and reliability of ore grades and commodity prices  affect successful project development 
the reactivation and efficient operation of processing facilities  the existence of competent operational management and prudent financial administration  as well as the availability and reliability of appropriately skilled and experienced consultants also can affect successful project development 
there can be no assurance that our exploration and development programs  including the advancement of the hycroft oxide operation  the feasibility study for the hycroft milling project and the preliminary economic assessment of hasbrouck  will result in economically viable mining operations or yield new mineral reserves and resources 
cost estimates and timing of new projects are uncertain 
the capital expenditures and time required to develop and explore our properties  including the hycroft and hasbrouck properties  are considerable and changes in costs  construction schedules or both  can affect project economics 
there are a number of factors that can affect costs and construction schedules  including  among others availability of labor  power  transportation and infrastructure  changes in input commodity prices and labor costs  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  availability and terms of financing  changes in anticipated tonnage  grade and metallurgical characteristics of the ore to be mined and processed  recovery rates of gold and other metals from the ore  difficulty of estimating construction costs over a period of years  delays in completing any environmental review or in obtaining environmental or other government permits  weather and severe climate impacts  and potential delays related to social and community issues 

table of contents the scoping study initially announced by us in april and subsequently updated in september relates to the economic potential of the sulfide mineralization at the hycroft property and is not part of  and should be distinguished from  the current oxide heap leach mining operation 
the scoping study is based solely on the other mineralized material or measured and indicated sulfide resources as defined by ni defined on the property 
mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability 
investors should be cautioned that the scoping study is very preliminary in nature and  accordingly  is subject to a high degree of uncertainty 
a preliminary and or a definitive feasibility study will be required to further evaluate project economics 
we do not currently intend to use forward sale arrangements to protect against low commodity prices and  as a result  our operating results are exposed to the impact of any significant drop in commodity prices 
we do not currently intend to enter into forward sales arrangements to reduce the risk of exposure to volatility in commodity prices 
accordingly  our future operations are exposed to the impact of any significant decrease in commodity prices 
if such prices decrease significantly  we will realize reduced revenues 
while it is not our current intention to enter into forward sales arrangements  we are not restricted from entering into forward sales arrangements at a future date 
the hazards and uncertainties associated with mining pose operational and environmental risks that may not be covered by insurance and may increase our costs 
mining and processing operations involve many hazards and uncertainties  including  among others environmental contamination  metallurgical and other processing problems  unusual and unexpected rock formations or water conditions  seismic activity  ground or slope failures or underground cave ins  industrial accidents  fires  flooding and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions or other acts of nature  organized labor disputes or work slow downs  mechanical equipment failure and facility performance problems  and the availability of critical materials  equipment and skilled labor 
these risks could result in damage to  or destruction of  our properties or production facilities  personal injury or death  environmental damage  delays in mining or processing  increased production costs  asset write downs  monetary losses and legal liability 
we cannot be certain that our insurance will cover all of the risks associated with mining and processing or that we will be able to maintain insurance to cover these risks at economically feasible premiums 
we could also become subject to liability for hazards against which we cannot insure or against which we may elect not to insure because of high premium costs or commercial impracticality 
such events could result in a prolonged interruption in operations that would have a negative effect on our ability to generate revenues  profits and cash flow 
losses from such events may increase costs and decrease profitability 
we may be unable to raise additional capital on favorable terms 
the exploration and development of our properties  including the advancement of the hycroft oxide operation  the feasibility study for the hycroft milling project and the preliminary economic assessment of hasbrouck  will require significant capital investment 
failure to obtain sufficient financing may result in the delay or indefinite postponement of exploration activity  development or production on any of our properties 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or on terms we consider acceptable 
we face intense competition in the mining industry 
the mining industry is intensely competitive 
as a result of this competition  some of which is with large established mining companies with substantial capabilities and with greater financial and technical resources than ours  we may be unable to acquire additional attractive mining claims or financing on terms we consider acceptable 
this  in turn  may adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations 
we also compete with other mining companies in the recruitment and retention of qualified managerial and technical employees 
if we are unable to successfully attract and retain qualified employees  our exploration and development programs may be slowed down or suspended 
our exploration and development operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations  which could result in the incurrence of additional costs and operational delays 
all phases of our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation 
these environmental regulations require we obtain various operating approvals and licenses and also impose standards and controls relating to exploration  development and production activities 
the regulatory environment in which we operate is evolving in a manner that will require stricter standards and enforcement  increased fines and penalties for non compliance  more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers  directors and employees 
new environmental laws and regulations or changes in existing environmental laws and regulations could have a negative effect on exploration activities  operations  production levels and methods of production 
there is no assurance that future changes in environmental laws and regulations will not adversely affect our projects 

table of contents our properties in nevada occupy private and public lands and are subject to environmental regulation  under applicable federal and state laws and regulations 
production at our hycroft mine involves the use of sodium cyanide  which is a toxic material 
should sodium cyanide leak or otherwise be discharged from the containment system  we may become subject to liability for cleanup work that may not be insured 
us federal laws the comprehensive environmental  response  compensation  and liability act cercla  and comparable state statutes  impose strict  joint and several liability on current and former owners and operators of sites and on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at such sites 
it is not uncommon for the government to file claims requiring cleanup actions  demands for reimbursement for government incurred cleanup costs  or natural resource damages  or for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment 
the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra  and comparable state statutes  govern the disposal of solid waste and hazardous waste and authorize the imposition of substantial fines and penalties for noncompliance  as well as requirements for corrective actions 
cercla  rcra and comparable state statutes can impose liability for clean up of sites and disposal of substances found on exploration  mining and processing sites long after activities on such sites have been completed 
the clean air act  as amended  restricts the emission of air pollutants from many sources  including mining and processing activities 
our mining operations may produce air emissions  including fugitive dust and other air pollutants from stationary equipment  storage facilities and the use of mobile sources such as trucks and heavy construction equipment  which are subject to review  monitoring and or control requirements under the clean air act and state air quality laws 
new facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin  and existing facilities may be required to incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance 
in addition  permitting rules may impose limitations on our production levels or result in additional capital expenditures in order to comply with the rules 
the national environmental policy act nepa requires federal agencies to integrate environmental considerations into their decision making processes by evaluating the environmental impacts of their proposed actions  including issuance of permits to mining facilities such as hycroft mine  and assessing alternatives to those actions 
if a proposed action could significantly affect the environment  the agency must prepare a detailed statement known as an environmental impact statement eis 
the us environmental protection agency  other federal agencies  and any interested third parties will review and comment on the scoping of the eis and the adequacy of and findings set forth in the draft and final eis 
this process can cause delays in issuance of required permits or result in changes to a project to mitigate its potential environmental impacts  which can in turn impact the economic feasibility of a proposed project 
the clean water act cwa  and comparable state statutes  impose restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants into waters of the united states 
the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited  except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the environmental protection agency epa or an analogous state agency 
the cwa regulates storm water mining facilities and requires a storm water discharge permit for certain activities 
such a permit requires the regulated facility to monitor and sample storm water run off from its operations 
the cwa and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit discharges of dredged and fill material in wetlands and other waters of the united states unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit 
the cwa and comparable state statutes provide for civil  criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of pollutants and impose liability on parties responsible for those discharges for the costs of cleaning up any environmental damage caused by the release and for natural resource damages resulting from the release 
the safe drinking water act sdwa and the underground injection control uic program promulgated thereunder  regulate the drilling and operation of subsurface injection wells 
epa directly administers the uic program in some states and in others the responsibility for the program has been delegated to the state 
the program requires that a permit be obtained before drilling a disposal or injection well 
violation of these regulations and or contamination of groundwater by mining related activities may result in fines  penalties  and remediation costs  among other sanctions and liabilities under the swda and state laws 
in addition  third party claims may be filed by landowners and other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies  property damages  and bodily injury 
nevada laws at the state level  mining operations in nevada are also regulated by the nevada department of conservation and natural resources  division of environmental protection 
nevada state law requires the hycroft mine to hold nevada water pollution control permits  which dictate operating controls and closure and post closure requirements directed at protecting surface and ground water 
in addition  we are required to hold nevada reclamation permits 
these permits mandate concurrent and post mining reclamation of mines and require the posting of reclamation bonds sufficient to guarantee the cost of mine reclamation 
we have set up a provision for our reclamation bond at the hycroft mine but this provision may not be adequate 
if we are required to carry out unanticipated reclamation work  our financial position could be adversely affected 

table of contents other nevada regulations govern operating and design standards for the construction and operation of any source of air contamination and landfill operations 
any changes to these laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our financial performance and results of operations by  for example  requiring changes to operating constraints  technical criteria  fees or surety requirements 
legislation has been proposed that would significantly affect the mining industry 
members of the us congress have repeatedly introduced bills which would supplant or alter the provisions of the mining law of if enacted  such legislation could change the cost of holding unpatented mining claims and could significantly impact our ability to develop mineralized material on unpatented mining claims 
such bills have proposed  among other things  to either eliminate or greatly limit the right to a mineral patent and to impose a federal royalty on production from unpatented mining claims 
although we cannot predict what legislated royalties might be  the enactment of these proposed bills could adversely affect the potential for development of unpatented mining claims and the economics of existing operating mines on federal unpatented mining claims 
passage of such legislation could adversely affect our financial performance 
regulations and pending legislation governing issues involving climate change could result in increased operating costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to various climate change interest groups and the potential impact of climate change 
legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change could impose significant costs on us  our venture partners and our suppliers  including costs related to increased energy requirements  capital equipment  environmental monitoring and reporting and other costs to comply with such regulations 
any adopted future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations 
given the emotion  political significance and uncertainty around the impact of climate change and how it should be dealt with  we cannot predict how legislation and regulation will affect our financial condition  operating performance and ability to compete 
furthermore  even without such regulation  increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about potential impacts on climate change by us or other companies in our industry could harm our reputation 
the potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain  and would be particular to the geographic circumstances in areas in which we operate 
these may include changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities  water shortages  changing sea levels and changing temperatures 
these impacts may adversely impact the cost  production and financial performance of our operations 
a shortage of equipment and supplies could adversely affect our ability to operate our business 
we are dependent on various supplies and equipment to carry out our mining exploration and development operations 
the shortage of such supplies  equipment and parts could have a material adverse effect on our ability to carry out our operations and therefore limit or increase the cost of production 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel  we may be unable to establish and develop our business 
our development in the future will be highly dependent on the efforts of key management employees  namely  robert buchan  our executive chairman  scott caldwell  our president and chief executive officer  hal kirby  our executive vice president and chief financial officer  and other key employees that we may hire in the future 
although we have entered into employment agreements with key employees  we do not have and currently have no plans to obtain key man insurance with respect to any of our key employees 
as well  we will need to recruit and retain other qualified managerial and technical employees to build and maintain our operations 
if we are unable to successfully recruit and retain such persons  our development and growth could be significantly curtailed 
our lack of operating experience may cause us difficulty in managing our growth 
we commenced operations on may  as an independent entity and are establishing operating procedures for evaluating  acquiring and developing properties  and negotiating  establishing and maintaining strategic relationships 
our ability to manage our growth  if any  will require us to improve and expand our management and our operational and financial systems and controls 
if the experience of current management is unable to manage growth effectively  our business and financial condition would be materially harmed 
in addition  if rapid growth occurs  it may strain our operational  managerial and financial resources 
there are uncertainties as to title matters in the mining industry 
any defects in such title could cause us to lose our rights in mineral properties and jeopardize our business operations 
our mineral properties consist of private mineral rights  leases covering state and private lands  leases of patented mining claims and unpatented mining claims 
many of our mining properties in the united states are unpatented mining claims located on lands 
table of contents administered by the us bureau of land management blm  nevada state office to which we have only possessory title 
because title to unpatented mining claims is subject to inherent uncertainties  it is difficult to determine conclusively ownership of such claims 
these uncertainties relate to such things as sufficiency of mineral discovery  proper location and posting and marking of boundaries  and possible conflicts with other claims not determinable from descriptions of record 
since a substantial portion of all mineral exploration  development and mining in the united states now occurs on unpatented mining claims  this uncertainty is inherent in the mining industry 
the present status of our unpatented mining claims located on public lands allows us the right to mine and remove valuable minerals  such as precious and base metals  from the claims conditioned upon applicable environmental reviews and permitting programs 
we also are allowed to use the surface of the land solely for purposes related to mining and processing the mineral bearing ores 
however  legal ownership of the land remains with the united states 
we remain at risk that the mining claims may be forfeited either to the united states or to rival private claimants due to failure to comply with statutory requirements 
prior to  a mining claim locator who was able to prove the discovery of valuable  locatable minerals on a mining claim  and to meet all other applicable federal and state requirements and procedures pertaining to the location and maintenance of federal unpatented mining claims  had the right to prosecute a patent application to secure fee title to the mining claim from the federal government 
the right to pursue a patent  however  has been subject to a moratorium since october  through federal legislation restricting the blm from accepting any new mineral patent applications 
if we do not obtain fee title to our unpatented mining claims  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain compensation in connection with the forfeiture of such claims 
there may be challenges to title to the mineral properties in which we hold a material interest 
if there are title defects with respect to any properties  we might be required to compensate other persons or perhaps reduce our interest in the affected property 
also  in any such case  the investigation and resolution of title issues would divert our management s time from ongoing exploration and development programs 
some of our directors may have conflicts of interest as a result of their involvement with other natural resource companies 
some of our directors are directors or officers of other natural resource or mining related companies  or may be involved in related pursuits that could present conflicts of interest with their roles at allied nevada 
in the event that any such conflict of interest arises  a director who has such a conflict is required to disclose the conflict at a meeting of the directors of the company and to abstain from voting for or against approval of any matter in which such director may have a conflict 
in appropriate cases  we will establish a special committee of independent directors to review a matter in which directors  or management  may have a conflict 
future sales of our common stock in the public or private markets could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings 
future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or equity related securities in the public or private markets  or the perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity related securities 
as of february    shares of our common stock were outstanding 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that future sales of our common stock  or the perception that such sales could occur  will have on the trading price of our common stock 
we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future 
we have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock 
we intend to retain all of our earnings for the foreseeable future to finance the operation and expansion of our business  and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the future 
as a result  you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases 
our board of directors retains the discretion to change this policy 
anti takeover provisions in our organizational documents and under delaware law could make a third party acquisition of the company difficult 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests 
these provisions include the ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock and the ability of our board of directors to amend the bylaws without stockholder approval 
in addition  as a delaware corporation  we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  which generally prohibits a delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder  unless certain specific requirements are met as set forth in section collectively  these provisions could make a third party acquisition of the company difficult or could discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities 

table of contents our gold and silver production may decline  reducing our revenues and negatively impacting our business 
our future gold and silver production may decline as a result of an exhaustion of reserves and possible closure of mines 
it is our business strategy to conduct gold and silver exploratory activities at the hycroft and hasbrouck properties and to consider the acquisition of gold and silver mining properties and businesses or reserves that possess minable ore reserves and are expected to become operational in the near future 
we can provide no assurance that our gold and silver production in the future will not decline 
accordingly  our revenues from the sale of gold and silver may decline  negatively affecting our results of operations 
our ability to find and acquire new mineral properties is uncertain 
accordingly  our prospects are uncertain for the future growth of our business 
because mines have limited lives based on proven and probable ore reserves  we are continually seeking to replace and expand our ore reserves 
identifying promising mining properties is difficult and speculative 
furthermore  we encounter strong competition from other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of properties producing or capable of producing gold and silver 
many of these companies have greater financial resources than we do 
consequently  we may be unable to replace and expand current ore reserves through the acquisition of new mining properties or interests therein on terms we consider acceptable 
as a result  our revenues from the sale of gold and silver may decline  resulting in lower income and reduced growth 
environmental regulations could require us to make significant expenditures or expose us to potential liability 
to the extent we may become subject to environmental liabilities  the payment of such liabilities or the costs that we may incur to remedy environmental pollution would reduce funds otherwise available to us and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to fully remedy an environmental problem  we might be required to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy 
the environmental standards that may ultimately be imposed at a mine site impact the cost of remediation and may exceed the financial accruals that have been made for such remediation 
the potential exposure may be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  governmental authorities and private parties may bring lawsuits based upon damage to property and injury to persons resulting from the environmental  health and safety impacts of our past and current operations  which could lead to the imposition of substantial fines  remediation costs  penalties and other civil and criminal sanctions 
substantial costs and liabilities  including for restoring the environment after the closure of mines  are inherent in our operations 
although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations  we cannot assure you that any such law  regulation  enforcement or private claim will not have a negative effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance  which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 
we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self regulated organizations  including the securities and exchange commission  the nyse amex  and the financial accounting standards board 
these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by congress  making compliance more difficult and uncertain 
for example  on july   congress passed the dodd frank wall street reform and protection act 
our efforts to comply with the dodd frank act and other new regulations have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
we may be adversely affected by challenges relating to slope stability 
our open pit mines get deeper as we mine them  presenting certain geotechnical challenges including the possibility of slope failure 
if we are required to decrease pit slope angles or provide additional road access to prevent such a failure  our stated reserves could be negatively affected 
further  hydrological conditions relating to pit slopes  renewal of material displaced by slope failures and increased stripping requirements could also negatively affect our stated reserves 
we have taken actions in order to maintain slope stability  but we cannot assure that we will not have to take additional action in the future or that our actions taken to date will be sufficient 
unexpected failure or additional requirements to prevent slope failure may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition  as well as have the effect of diminishing our stated ore reserves 
to the extent that we seek to expand our operations and increase our reserves through acquisitions  we may experience issues in executing acquisitions or integrating acquired operations 
from time to time  we may examine opportunities to make selective acquisitions in order to expand our operations and reported reserves 
the success of any acquisition would depend on a number of factors  including  but not limited to identifying suitable candidates for acquisition and negotiating acceptable terms for any such acquisition  
table of contents obtaining approval from regulatory authorities and potentially the company s shareholders  maintaining our financial and strategic focus and avoiding distraction of management during the process of integrating the acquired business  and implementing our standards  controls  procedures and policies at the acquired business 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to conclude any acquisitions successfully  or that any acquisition will achieve the anticipated synergies or other positive results 
any material problems that we encounter in connection with such an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
joint ventures and other partnerships may expose us to risks 
in the future  we may enter into joint ventures or other partnership arrangements with other parties in relation to the exploration  development and production of certain of the properties in which we have an interest 
joint ventures can often require unanimous approval of the parties to the joint venture or their representatives for certain fundamental decisions such as an increase or reduction of registered capital  merger  division  dissolution  amendments of constating documents  and the pledge of joint venture assets  which means that each joint venture party may have a veto right with respect to such decisions which could lead to a deadlock in the operations of the joint venture or partnership 
further  we may be unable to exert control over strategic decisions made in respect of such properties 
any failure of such other companies to meet their obligations to us or to third parties  or any disputes with respect to the parties respective rights and obligations  could have a material adverse effect on the joint ventures or their properties and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial performance  cash flows and the price of the common shares 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none 
item properties we classify our mineral properties into three categories operating properties  advanced exploration properties  and other exploration properties 
operating properties are properties on which the company operates a producing mine 
the hycroft mine  as described below  is currently our only operating property 
advanced exploration properties are properties where we retain a significant controlling interest or joint venture and there has been sufficient drilling and analysis completed to identify and report reserves or other mineralized material 
other exploration properties are those for which insufficient drilling and geologic investigations have been completed to define mineralized materials 
please see below for information about our operating properties  advanced exploration properties  and other exploration properties 
other than the hycroft mine  we cannot be certain that any mineral deposits will be discovered in sufficient quantities and grade to justify commercial operations 
whether a mineral deposit will be commercially viable depends on a number of factors  including the particular attributes of the deposit  metal prices  which are highly cyclical  the cost to extract and process the mineralized material  and government regulations and permitting requirements 
we may be unable to upgrade our mineralized material to proven and probable reserves in sufficient quantities to justify commercial operations and we may not be able to raise sufficient capital to develop our properties 
estimates of reserves and mineralization herein are subject to the effect of changes in metal prices  and to the risks inherent in mining and processing operations 
in addition  allied nevada has seven geothermal leases that were entered into during from the blm 
these leases occur in proximity to  or in some cases overlap with  existing allied nevada mineral holdings  and were obtained through competitive bidding 

table of contents operating properties hycroft mine logo we currently have one operating property  the hycroft mine  which we also refer to as the hycroft mine in this document 
this mine and related facilities are located miles west of winnemucca  nevada 
winnemucca population  is a commercial community on interstate  miles northeast of reno 
the town is served by a transcontinental railroad and has a municipal airport 
access to the hycroft mine from winnemucca is by means of state road no 
jungo road  a good quality  unpaved road 
the entrance to the mine is several hundred feet off the road 
well maintained mine and exploration roads provide access throughout the property 
access is also possible from imlay  gerlach  and lovelock by unpaved roads intersecting interstate and nevada state route the majority of our employees live in the winnemucca area 
the mine is situated east of the black rock desert on the western flank of the kamma mountains between winnemucca and gerlach 
there are no streams  rivers  or major lakes in the general area 
elevations in the mine area range between  and  ft above sea level 
the company holds patented and  unpatented mining claims that constitute our hycroft mine operating property 
the total acreage covered by unpatented claims is approximately  acres with an additional  acres related to the patented claims 
the details of these claims and the holding requirements are discussed in greater detail in the geology and ore reserve section that follows 
the climate of the region is arid  with precipitation averaging inches per year 
temperatures during the summer range from daily low temperatures lows of f to daily high temperatures highs of greater than f and winter temperatures range from lows of f to highs of f 
there is strong surface heating during the day and rapid nighttime cooling because of the dry air 
this results in wide ranges in daily temperatures 
the hycroft mine consists of multiple open pit mines  associated waste dumps and two heap leach pads 
the hycroft mine was formally known as the crofoot lewis open pit mine 
mining began in the area in with a small heap leaching operation known as the lewis mine 
lewis mine production was followed by production from the crofoot property in the bay  south central  boneyard  gap and cut pits along the central fault  and finally the north end of the brimstone pit and continued until it was placed on a care and maintenance program in december due to low gold prices 
during this first operating period the mine produced over one million ounces of gold and two and half million ounces of silver 
gold production from the leaching and rinsing of the heap leach pads  continued in and in   and  the amount of gold recovered was not material 
the lewis mine was acquired by vista in early from fw lewis  inc and the crofoot mine was acquired by vista in april the leasehold interest in the lewis property along with gold and silver nsrs was purchased from fw lewis  inc by vista on december  in consideration of the payment of million 
the crofoot property was originally held under two leases and is now owned by allied nevada subject to a net profits interest retained by the former owners 
the lease agreements include for the payment of advance royalty payments of  in any year where mining occurs on the crofoot claims 
all advance royalty payments are credited against the future payments under the net profits royalty 
the total lease payments under the crofoot leases claims are subject to a maximum of million in royalty payments of which the company has paid  through december  the site receives line current provided by nv energy from the northwestern power grid 
with the cooperation of the power provider  we inspected the substations  power lines and transformers and repaired and replaced necessary components 

table of contents we currently have water rights  which are adequate to process the planned oxide heap leach ore 
we have rehabilitated the primary process water well and fresh water well and have developed a new back up process water well 
in  hycroft successfully completed its second full year of operations  achieving its stated operating goals 
the mine moved million tons of material  including million tons of ore placed on the leach pad at average grades of opt gold and opt silver  placing  contained ounces of gold  recoverable ounces and  contained ounces of silver  recoverable ounces 
the company sold  ounces of gold and  ounces of silver in the major accomplishments in were as follows completed more than one full year with no lost time accidents and no significant environmental issues 
completed two ni compliant updated mineralized material estimates in april and august  the mineralized material estimate announced in april indicated a increase in gold proven and probable reserves to million ounces and an initial silver proven and probable reserve of million ounces  subsequently updated to million ounces in august when compared with the mineralized material estimate announced in march began implementing the accelerated oxide heap leach project designed to increase the mining rate  thereby more than doubling gold production by this will be accomplished by purchasing a larger capacity mining fleet of ton haul trucks and hydraulic shovels over the next two years 
purchased and placed into operation three ton haul trucks and a larger capacity shovel in connection with the accelerated oxide mining expansion 
also  in  the company began operating a mobile crushing unit which is expected to crush the higher grade siliceous mineralization in order to improve total leach recoveries for gold and silver 
it is expected that additional larger capacity mining equipment and mobile crushing units will be added in the next two years as part of the implementation of the accelerated oxide mining expansion 
announced and updated a positive milling scoping study with the goal of defining an economically viable processing option for the mineralization 
ongoing metallurgical test work throughout continued to show positive results for the grind flotation cyanidation of the tailings flowsheet for the milling scenario 
at january  the company had completed approximately of the required test work for the milling feasibility study 
overall  testing of the composites through the grind flotation cyanidation of the tailing flowsheet indicate recoveries of for gold and for silver 
concentrate from six bulk samples are currently being tested through various oxidation techniques and the results will indicate the overall recovery through the entire milling flotation oxidation circuit 
completed a million square foot expansion to the brimstone leach pad as planned 
completed modifications to the leach pad  ponds  pumping system and piping to allow for stacking of pregnant solutions increasing the grade by recycling lower grade solution back to the pad 
by increasing the grade of gold and silver in the pregnant solution  the operating efficiencies of the merrill crowe plant and the cic plant are expected to improve 
in addition  the solution flow rate was increased from  to  gpm allowing for the lower grade solutions to be recycled back up to the pad without impacting production 
in june   we completed an underwritten public offering pursuant to which we issued  common shares for aggregate proceeds of cdn  proceeds from the financing were to satisfy initial capital needs for the accelerated oxide expansion  to fund exploration programs and to complete the initial milling feasibility study for hycroft 
completed the hycroft exploration season with holes drilled totaling  feet of drilling 
completed an initial drill program at hasbrouck with positive results 
management intends to complete a preliminary economic assessment for hasbrouck in the first quarter of accelerated oxide plan the accelerated oxide mine plan is being phased in over the next two years  with expected production increasing from  ounces of gold and  ounces of silver in to over  ounces of gold in and peaking at over  ounces in each of and this accelerated plan assumes an average mining rate of million tons per year will be achieved by utilizing larger ton haul trucks and larger capacity hydraulic shovels 
total annual tons moved are expected to include million tons of ore and million tons of waste with approximately of the ore being crushed 
the current oxide reserve is sufficient to support this mining rate into  however  based on past exploration success and technical knowledge  management believes that ongoing exploration will continue to convert and expand oxide mineralization  extending mine life 
the total capital required  over the life of the mine  to implement this accelerated mining plan is expected to be approximately million 
the initial capital of approximately million  spent over the first three years  is for the inclusion of a larger capacity mining fleet million  leach pad expansions million  mobile crushing units million and modifications to existing infrastructure such as the process plant and refinery million 
it is expected that the mobile mining fleet may be purchased with capital lease financing through the equipment manufacturer if commercial terms are available 
mill project scoping study the company completed a milling scoping study in april  designed to extract the large sulfide resource and additional oxide resources associated with the sulfides 
this study was subsequently updated in september of the scoping study

this updated scoping study concludes that average annual production of approximately  ounces of gold and million ounces of silver could be produced from the combined  tpd milling operation and  tpd heap leach operation 
the estimated capital cost was expected to be billion for the milling and flotation process facility  additional leach pads  mining equipment and other ancillary infrastructure 
the milling facility would be comprised of one or two lines  with each consisting of a primary crusher  semi autogenous grinding mill  two ball mills  a flotation and cyanidation leach circuit and could be implemented in stages in order to manage capital expenditures over the first few years of the project 
the company expects to complete an update to the scoping study in march based on the favorable result of the milling scoping study and the subsequent updates  the company is preparing an initial feasibility study  currently expected to be released in the third quarter of recent metallurgical testing shows a processing method for the oxide and sulfide ore that would include grinding  flotation to make a sulfide concentrate  autoclaving and leaching of the concentrate  and conventional leaching of the flotation tails 
management continues to review other options for concentrate processing including roasting and offsite sales 
the project described in the scoping study will require federal and state environmental permits and a site wide environmental impact statement eis 
preliminary work required for the eis  such as base line water sampling and archeology surveys  began late in the scoping study assumes receipt of all required state and federal permits to construct and operate the sulfide mine and plant in three years 
management believes that construction and commissioning of the plant may take two years 
geology the hycroft mine is located on the western flank of the kamma mountains 
the deposit is hosted in a volcanic eruptive breccia and conglomerates associated with the tertiary kamma mountain volcanics 
the volcanics are mainly acidic to intermediate tuffs  flows and coarse volcaniclastic rocks 
fragments of these units dominate the clasts in the eruptive breccia 
volcanic rocks have been block faulted by dominant north trending structures  which have affected the distribution of alteration and mineralization 
the central fault and east fault control the distribution of mineralization and subsequent oxidation 
a post mineral range front fault separates the orebody from the adjacent pleistocene lahontan lake sediments in the black rock desert 
the known gold mineralization within the crofoot and lewis properties extends for a distance of three miles in a north south direction by miles in an east west direction 
mineralization extends to a depth of less than feet in the outcropping to near outcropping portion of the deposit on the northwest side to over  feet in the vortex deposit in the east 
not all the mineralization is oxidized and the depth of oxide ore varies considerably over the area of mineralization 
we currently have patented claims that comprise approximately  acres and  unpatented claims that comprise approximately  acres 
combining the patented and unpatented claims  our claims total approximately  acres 
this claim package was acquired by the company in a series of transactions the crofoot property and approximately  acres of claims were acquired by vista in the crofoot property  originally held under lease  is owned by hycroft resources development  inc subject to a net profits interest retained by the former owners 
the fw lewis property and approximately  acres of claims were acquired by vista in early in  approximately  acres of additional claims were staked by vista 
these claims were around or contiguous to the original crofoot and fw lewis claims 
in  we staked approximately  acres of additional claims contiguous to or around the existing hycroft claims 
in  we staked an additional claims consisting of approximately  acres contiguous to or around the existing hycroft land holding 
in  we staked an additional claims and  acres contiguous to or around the existing hycroft land holding 
our hycroft patented claims occupy private lands and our unpatented claims occupy public lands 
the public lands include unpatented mining claims on lands administered by the blm 
these claims are governed by the laws and regulations of the us federal government and the state of nevada 
to maintain the patented claims in good standing  we must pay the annual property tax payments to the county in which the claims are held 
to maintain the unpatented claims in good standing  we must file a notice of intent to maintain the claims within the county and pay the annual mineral claim filing fees to the blm 
mineral proven and probable ore reserves recoverable proven and probable reserves summarized below and detailed on the following pages have been calculated as of december   in accordance with industry guide as required by the securities exchange act of proven and probable reserves may not be comparable to similar information regarding mineral reserves disclosed in accordance with the guidance of other countries 
proven and probable reserves were determined by the use of mapping  drilling  sampling  assaying and evaluation methods generally applied in the mining industry  as more fully discussed below 
the term reserve  as used in the reserve data presented here  means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination 
the term proven reserves means reserves for which quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  
table of contents trenches  workings or drill holes  grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling  and the sites for inspection  sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size  shape  depth and mineral content of reserves are well established 
the term probable reserves means reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced 
the degree of assurance  although lower than that for proven reserves  is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 
our reserve estimates are based on the latest available geological and geotechnical studies 
we conduct ongoing studies of our ore bodies to optimize economic values and to manage risk 
we revise our mine plans and estimates of recoverable proven and probable mineral reserves as required in accordance with the latest available studies 
our estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves are prepared by and are the responsibility of our employees  and a majority of these estimates are reviewed and verified by independent experts in mining  geology and reserve determination 
estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves at december   were determined using long term average prices of per ounce for gold and per ounce for silver 
the london spot metal prices for the past three years averaged  per ounce for gold and per ounce for silver 
below is a summary of the mineral proven and probable ore reserves as of december  gold silver ore contained contained waste tons ounces ounces tons strip category s oz ton s oz ton s s ratio proven reserves probable reserves proven and probable reserves mine operations the mining in of our current proven and probable ore reserves in the brimstone pit and cut pit will be conducted by open pit methods using and ton haul trucks  cubic yard hydraulic shovels and cubic yard wheel loaders and dml blast hole drills 
mining in the brimstone pit has been designed with five mining phases  and the cut pit will be mined in two single top down mining sequences 
our current mine plans are to increase production to an annual mining rate of million tons of material in  million tons of material in  and million tons of material in we are currently in the third phase of five phases of mining in the brimstone pit and the first phase of mining in the cut pit 
this phase of mining involves the mining of more ore and less waste  than experienced in the previous phase  and it is expected that the strip ratio will be lower than the average life of mine strip ratio of we are in the middle of an expansion program to deliver more ore to the heap leach pads and have taken delivery of three ton haul trucks and one hydraulic shovel have been mobilized and we are expecting deliveries of an additional five ton haul trucks and two cubic yard hydraulic shovels 
a mobile crusher was purchased and delivered in and is capable of crushing twelve thousand tons per day to inch minus  allowing for enhanced recovery of high grade heap leach ores 
this crushing unit has primarily been used for crushing overliner material for the expansion of the brimstone leach pad 
there is a significant amount of acid leach material being mined  which is relatively soft material and does not require crushing 
it is anticipated that we will mine out the acid leach material by mid to late  and we may ultimately add two more similar crushing systems when more siliceous ore feed becomes available 
for  lower grade ore will be hauled by truck and placed on the brimstone leach pad as run of mine material 
higher grade material will be crushed and placed on the brimstone leach pad in dedicated areas 
the brimstone pad system is currently comprised of the previously operated brimstone leach pad and has grown through three expansions in each of  and this leach pad system has sufficient capacity to handle our ore placement requirements for we plan to continually expand this leach pad system in and future years to meet production requirements 
all ore grade material placed on the leach pad will be cross ripped to enhance permeability 
a network of solution drip lines will be positioned and the run of mine material will be leached with a cyanide solution for a period of about to days before another foot high lift of ore is placed on top of the existing lift 
return solution from the pad containing the precious metals is directed to the pregnant or lean solution pond 
gold will be removed from pregnant solutions using a cic process and at the brimstone plant using the merrill crowe process 
the product from the cic process will be transported to a third party for processing to recover the precious metals from the carbon and produce a dor containing gold and silver 
dor containing gold and silver will be produced at the hycroft mine from the merrill crowe process 
low grade pregnant solution directed to the lean pond will be used for stacking which encompasses recycling pregnant solution back to the ore pad to increase solution overall metal grades 
based on previous operating experience  of the gold and of the silver placed on the pad as run of mine production is expected to be recovered in the plant 
crushing ore is expected to improve the overall average recovery of gold and silver 

table of contents during  we expect to increase the annual gold production from the hycroft mine 
the alternatives we are implementing include increasing mining rates in order to increase annual gold production 
an accelerated mine plan  approved by the company in  will increase the tons mined to million per year by the additional ore mined would result in annual gold recoveries of  ounces   ounces  and  ounces for the years ended   and  respectively 
the existing mobile mine equipment fleet and process facilities are currently being expanded to accommodate the increased production 
expanding the merrill crowe operation to allow the flow rate to be increased from  gpm to  gpm 
this will increase gold and silver production 
hycroft mine exploration since the formation of the company in may  allied nevada  as of year end  has drilled a total of holes  for combined total of  feet  at the hycroft mine 
material from all the holes has been assayed using a fire assay procedure for both gold and silver content by one of two independent laboratories 
upon completion of a drill hole  the hole is surveyed and then plugged 
management of the drill program  sample collection and assay program is being carried out by allied nevada 
qualified independent consultants have reviewed all aspects of the exploration program and are expected to conduct regular reviews of the ongoing exploration program 
in  we drilled holes  representing approximately  feet  with focus on infilling the vortex zone to the south of the brimstone pit and better defining material at the central pit 
we are expecting to announce a reserve update in  incorporating all drilling completed to december  of the total program  holes were directed towards infill and step out off of the vortex zone  holes towards infill of the bay zone  holes at central zone  and holes at brimstone zone 
the balance of the holes were primarily drilled to obtain material for metallurgical testing material 
a  foot exploration program has been designed for with a focus on expanding oxide and sulfide resources  improving the confidence level of oxide resources  and exploration of new areas of mineralization 
exploration spending at hycroft will be success driven and is expected to be approximately million in management intends to continue exploration drilling to expand on the sulfide system in additional metallurgical testing and engineering work in will be conducted as part of an initial feasibility study evaluating the economic viability of the sulfide mineralization 
the study is expected to be completed in the third quarter the analysis of the current drill results and historical geological information suggests that gold and silver mineralization is hosted along north south trending zones of approximately  feet in length 
these zones are partially defined laterally by post mineral faults 
the following currently identified zones are albert  bay  camel  central  boneyard  brimstone  foothills  and vortex 
the program is planned to include further exploration of the vortex  albert  and central zones 
any expansion of the hycroft mine necessary to exploit any additional reserves that may be established through our hycroft exploration drilling program that are not located within our current mine plan  will require us to obtain all necessary permits  approvals and consents of regulatory agencies responsible for the use and development of mines in nevada 
advanced exploration properties advanced exploration properties are both those properties where we retain a significant controlling interest or joint venture and where there has been sufficient drilling and analysis completed to identify and report reserves or other mineralized material and more than other exploration properties 
allied nevada currently has six properties on which mineralized material has been identified maverick springs a joint venture with silver standard  mountain view  hasbrouck  three hills  wildcat and pony creek elliot dome 
none of these properties currently have proven or probable reserves as defined by industry guide we are currently evaluating these properties to determine how to best advance these projects by increasing the identified mineral resources  improving the quality of these mineral resources  or advancing the project to a development decision 
the following map provides the general location of each of these six properties on which we have identified mineralized material 
all of the company s properties are within the state of nevada

table of contents hasbrouck the hasbrouck property is located in southwestern nevada about miles south southwest of the town of tonopah in esmeralda county  nevada  adjacent to us highway and approximately half way between reno and las vegas 
the property is accessed from tonopah by traveling south along us highway  which transects the claim block 
the project is accessed by a gravel road off of us highway that connects to a network of dirt drill roads that traverse hasbrouck 
the property consists of patented lode mining claims and unpatented lode claims that cover an area of approximately  acres 
on may   vista executed a purchase agreement with newmont capital  which includes both the hasbrouck property and the three hills property  which lies approximately miles to the north northwest 
the agreement included the right to acquire of hasbrouck and three hills properties upon an expenditure of million 
allied completed the threshold expenditure during the first half of upon notice by allied in august  newmont capital has elected to not participate in a joint venture on the properties 
as a result  allied nevada will retain ownership in these properties  subject to a nsr in each project together with the right to a  cash payment at the start of commercial production at either project and a further  cash payment if  after the start of commercial production  the gold price averages per ounce or more for any three month period 
an additional nsr on certain hasbrouck claims is held by other parties 
geology the property is located on hasbrouck mountain  which is thought to lie along the western edge of a caldera 
the mountain is underlain by gently dipping ash flow  air fall and waterlain tuffs and volcaniclastic sediments of the miocene siebert formation 
several occurrences of chalcedonic sinter deposits occur near the summit of the mountain 
gold and silver mineralization in the hasbrouck deposit appears to have formed relatively close to the paleo surface in an epithermal  hot spring environment 
the mineralization is concentrated in the siebert formation  in units stratigraphically below the chalcedonic sinter deposits that are exposed near the top of hasbrouck 
detailed surface mapping in conjunction with preliminary geological modeling conducted in strongly suggests the primary structural control to mineralization is northeast to northwest and not east west as previously believed 
multiple zones of mineralization are presently defined 
the main zone consists of two structurally and stratigraphically controlled mineral bodies 
additional areas of mineralization  such as the south adit zone  to  feet south of the main zone  are believed to be lateral zones along controlling faults with minimal to no drilling between 
a third party technical study was completed for vista in august and was updated in august the hasbrouck study was developed using data from  feet of drilling  principally comprised of reverse circulation holes totaling  feet and rotary drill holes totaling  feet 
the drilling database was compiled from work performed by fmc gold co  cordex syndicate and franco nevada inc between and the exploration program consisted of detailed mapping  systematic surface sampling  and drilling core holes for an aggregate of  feet to verify grade and provide material for metallurgical testing 
allied also revised  in  the geologic model for hasbrouck based on surface mapping and reinterpretation of drill hole logging data 
based on encouraging results  an expanded drilling campaign is anticipated in allied nevada has updated the resource model during the first quarter of  and intends to complete an updated mineral resource calculation 
three hills three hills is located in southwestern nevada about mile west of the town of tonopah in esmeralda county  nevada  and about miles northwest of the hasbrouck property described above 
access to the site is via county maintained gravel roads from the northwest end of town 
three hills consists of unpatented lode claims totaling approximately acres 

table of contents on may   vista executed a purchase agreement with newmont capital  which included both the hasbrouck property and the three hills property 
the terms of this agreement are detailed under the hasbrouck description above 
newmont capital did not exercise their right to acquire of the properties in august of geology three hills is located in the walker lane structural domain of the basin and range physiographic province 
it is in an area of structural disruption resulting from a series of orogenic events occurring in paleozoic  mesozoic and cenozoic times 
basin and range high angle normal faults control the mineralization at three hills  where they cut the siebert formation 
gold mineralization occurs in a zone of pervasive silicification and in the siebert formation and the upper to feet of the fraction tuff 
the contact between these two units contains consistently higher grades of gold and is more commonly argillized than silicified 
a third party technical study was completed for vista in august and was updated in august the three hills study included data from  feet of drilling  comprised of reverse circulation holes totaling  feet  air track and rotary holes totaling  feet and diamond drill holes totaling  feet

a gravel road provides immediate access to the property from the ruby valley road 
the property consists of claims with a total area of approximately  acres 
on october   vista completed the acquisition of a interest in the maverick springs gold and silver project from newmont mining corporation newmont and the mountain view gold project described below from newmont s wholly owned subsidiary newmont capital limited newmont capital 
maverick springs is subject to a lease agreement  between newmont and artemis exploration company 
the lease was entered into on october   and the key terms include payment of advance minimum royalties of  on october  and advance minimum royalties of  on october    on october  and each year thereafter while the agreement is in effect  work commitments of  feet of exploration drilling  on or before october in each of extended by agreement to november   and  a preliminary economic evaluation to be conducted by october  which was extended to april   and a net smelter returns royalty based on a sliding scale ranging from to  depending on gold and silver prices at the time of production 
on june   vista entered into an agreement granting silver standard resources inc silver standard or ssri an option to acquire its interest in the silver mineralized material hosted in the maverick springs project 
allied nevada  as successor to vista  will retain its interest in the gold mineralized material 
the agreement with ssri is subject to the terms of the newmont purchase agreement 
under the agreement  silver standard was to pay million over four years  completing the million obligation in since silver standard has satisfied the million obligation  all costs incurred for maverick springs are now being shared by the two corporations as stated below 
silver standard and vista formed a committee to jointly manage exploration of the maverick springs project 
allied nevada  as successor to vista  has a vote on the committee  and silver standard is the operator and has a vote 
future costs will be shared by silver standard and allied nevada on the same ratio as established for operation of the management committee allied nevada silver standard  subject to standard dilution provisions 
prior operators have conducted drilling on the maverick springs project 
in november  vista completed a hole reverse circulation drill program totaling  feet on the maverick springs project 
the program consisted of seven vertical reverse circulation holes  stepped out feet to  feet from previously identified mineralization 
all seven holes encountered flat lying mineralization  predominantly oxidized to depths of up to feet 
the program outlined continuous mineralization in a  foot by  foot area  immediately adjacent to known gold silver mineralization 
with additional in fill drilling  this newly outlined mineralization has the potential to significantly increase the mineralized material 
in october  vista completed a hole reverse circulation program totaling  feet  in october  vista completed a hole reverse circulation program totaling  feet and in august  vista completed a hole reverse circulation drill program totaling approximately  feet 
in the th quarter of  silver standard completed a hole program totaling  feet 
these results indicate the potential for bulk mineable gold silver mineralization 
geology maverick springs can be classified as a carlin type or sediment carbonate hosted disseminated silver gold deposit 
sediment hosted deposits are common within northern nevada  although the systems are usually gold dominated with relatively minor amounts of silver 
silver and gold mineralization at maverick springs has been interpreted as a roughly antiformal or arch shaped zone with an axis that plunges shallowly to the south and seems to flatten to horizontal over the northern half of the deposit 
the limbs of the arch dip shallowly to moderately at o to the east and west 
overall  the mineralized zone is elongated in the north south direction with a length of over  feet  a width of up to  feet  and a thickness of commonly feet 
alteration consists of pervasive decalcification  weak to intense silicification and weak alunitic argillization 
massive jasperoid is common in surface exposures and in drill core 
oxidation has affected all sulfides on surface and is pervasive to a depth of at least feet  intermittent to feet  and generally absent below  feet

newmont capital s interest in the mountain view property is subject to an underlying lease and two other royalty arrangements  the principal terms of which are the underlying lease grants a interest to newmont in all claims  with a few exceptions where a interest is granted  and the lessee may purchase the remaining interest in the claims for  at any time 
the lessee is obligated to purchase the remaining for  on achieving commercial production 
also  the lessee shall pay a nsr during production  with advance minimum payments of  per year 
advanced royalties are deductible from the net smelter returns royalty and cease upon purchase of the remaining interest of the underlying lease 
a nsr also applies to certain other claims 
prior operators have conducted drilling on the mountain view property 
vista completed a five hole reverse circulation program totaling  feet in november the results indicate the presence of a new zone of bulk mineralization approximately feet east of the known core of mineralization 
vista completed a five hole reverse circulation program totaling  feet in  and the results indicate potential bulk mineable gold mineralization and the down dip extension of higher grade gold mineralization 
geology the dominant rock types in the area are miocene volcanics and interbedded volcaniclastic sediments 
minor greenschist facies permo triassic strata occur to the northeast and a large body of granodiorite makes up the bulk of the granite range to the east and south 
the miocene lithologies consist of mafic tuffs  rhyolite tuffs and flows  volcaniclastic sediments and basalts 
these units are separated from the granite range to the east by a range front normal fault that dips steeply to the southwest 
the severance deposit is hosted by a unit known as the severance rhyolite that is sandwiched between the range front fault to the northeast and older tertiary tuffs  flows and volcaniclastic sediments to the southwest 
structure on the property is dominated by northwest and northeast trending faults 
major fault offsets occur along the range front fault system and these are offset by the northeast trending structures

geology wildcat lies in the seven troughs range  which is underlain by triassic and jurassic sedimentary rocks and has been intruded by cretaceous granodiorite 
volcanic domes and plugs of rhyolite  quartz latite  trachyte  and andesite have been emplaced by tertiary volcanism 
post mineral tertiary flows of pyroclastic debris  and vitrophyres of rhyolite  quartz latite  trachyte  and andesite composition blanket much of the area 

table of contents the property contains at least two aerially extensive breccia bodies located at the intersection of through going fault zones 
four areas  hero tag  main  northeast  and knob are located within the southern breccia body and contain the majority of drilling and all of the known resource 
these four areas are geologically similar with mineralization straddling the contact between granodiorite and overlying tuff within the breccia body 
mineralization hosted in the tuff generally tends to be lower grade disseminated style of mineralization represented by pervasive and intense silicification 
the underlying granodiorite also contains low grade disseminated style of mineralization with areas of higher grade associated with quartz vein stockwork 
generally  the granodiorite has higher grade and is not silicified 
any silicification is restricted to adjacent veins and veinlets 
peripheral to the breccia bodies  discrete mineralized banded veins in the granodiorite were exploited by historical mining and were generally not targeted by drilling 
deeper roots to the mineralized breccia bodies also have not been explored 
a second aerially extensive mineralized breccia body is located miles to the northwest in the cross roads area and is predominantly defined by surface samples only 
work completed in consisted of surface mapping  sampling  and a geophysical survey 
permits have been received from the bureau of land management and state of nevada to conduct an initial drill program in drilling will focus on initial testing of the cross roads breccia body  banded veins proximal to the southern breccia body  and potential roots to the southern breccia body 
the company anticipates submitting for additional permits for additional drilling activities in the first half of pony creek elliot dome property the pony creek elliot dome property is located in the larrabee mining district of elko county  nevada  in the southern half of the carlin trend  miles southeast of the town of carlin and miles south of newmont gold company s rain mine 
the property is accessed by traveling south from carlin along state highway a paved road  and then west on the pony creek road 
the pony creek elliot dome property consists of unpatented lode mining claims approximately  acres 
the property is located across the crest of the southern part of the pinyon range at elevations ranging from  feet to about  feet 
access to the property from the west is by traveling the indian pony road off state highway  or from the east via the red rock ranch road off a junction with state highway the exploration agreement previously in effect with mill city was terminated in and allied nevada has regained full title to the property 
prior to commencement of any surface disturbance  permits must be obtained from the blm which permits exploration activities and a reclamation bond must also be posted 
newmont exploration ltd 
newmont exploration conducted regional exploration programs in search of additional gold deposits along the carlin trend 
in a stream sediment sampling program identified anomalous gold and arsenic associated with an altered rhyolite body at what is now the pony creek property 
newmont located claims in to cover the prospect and located more claims in to cover additional ground 
newmont began drilling in and conducted drill programs through newmont conducted additional drilling campaigns in and with limited success 
an option was acquired by westmont mining  inc in  and in april of quest international management services  inc formerly ramrod gold  inc 
acquired westmont 
quest then joint ventured the property with uranerz usa  inc in uranerz drilled a total of holes in before terminating the jv in in quest purchased newmont s remaining interest in the property and signed a jv agreement with barrick 
four holes were drilled by barrick before they terminated the agreement in in  quest international resources was acquired by standard mining co 
and it abandoned the pony creek property 
mr 
pescio acquired pony creek by staking claims in the fall of homestake optioned the property shortly afterward 
a year later  after drilling reverse circulation drill holes  homestake terminated their agreement with mr 
pescio 
nevada contact inc optioned the property from the pescios in and drilled holes before terminating the agreement in early in july  mill city optioned the property from the pescios 
the mill city agreement was terminated in geology most of the property is comprised of dry  sagebrush covered and grass covered hills with a few juniper and pinyon pines 
the climate is favorable for year round mining and exploration may be done from may through november 
the pony creek property lies along the axis of a regional mesozoic anticline that parallels the crest of the pinyon range 
the lithologies of the region include the eastern carbonate assemblage and the mixed overlap assemblage 
the late devonian early mississippian roberts mountain thrust and the post pinyon anticline  mesozoic thrust faults have moved the western assemblage and 
table of contents a significant portion of the overlap series over the eastern facies 
high angle northeast and northwest trending faults and north trending faults  all with oblique displacement  and a younger set of east trending normal faults  are important elements in the structural framework of the region 
gold mineralization in the bowl area is related to felsite breccias 
in the pot holes area  a lens of fragmental felsite approximately feet thick intersects the low angle fault that is at the base of the robinson thrust plate 
the felsite breccias of the bowl area may be fault breccia to explosion breccias 
alteration within the intrusive includes quartz sericite pyrite qsp associated with north and northeast trending shears 
other exploration properties in general  these properties are those for which insufficient drilling and geologic investigations have been completed to define mineralized materials 
other exploration properties may include properties that the company does not have a significant controlling interest or joint venture on 
certain of these exploration properties have been optioned and leased to other exploration companies in return for production royalties averaging approximately advance minimum royalties and  on some of the properties  work commitments 
for the properties under lease  the lessee is typically responsible for making the land payments including the blm fees and county property tax payments 
blm filing fees and county property tax payments were paid for approximately  unpatented mining claims held by allied nevada 
we will pursue strategic options for the exploration properties that could include development through exploration programs  joint ventures  royalty agreements  or the sale or release of the mineral property

whenever msha believes a violation of the mine act  any health or safety standard or any regulation has occurred  it may issue a citation which describes the alleged violation and fixes a time within which the operator eg our subsidiary  hycroft resources development inc must abate the alleged violation 
in some situations  such as when msha believes that conditions pose a hazard to miners  msha may issue an order removing miners from the area of the mine affected by the condition until the alleged hazards are corrected 
when msha issues a citation or order  it generally proposes a civil penalty  or fine  as a result of the alleged violation  that the operator is ordered to pay 
citations and orders can be contested and appealed  and as part of that process  are often reduced in severity and amount  and are sometimes dismissed 
the following table reflects citations and orders issued to us by msha during the year ended december  and pending legal actions before the federal mine safety and health review commission the commission as of december  the proposed assessments for the year ended december  were taken from the msha data retrieval system as of december  additional information about the act and msha references used in the table follows 
section citations citations received from msha under section of the mine act  which includes citations for health or safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to a serious injury if left unabated 

table of contents section b orders orders issued by msha under section b of the mine act  which represents a failure to abate a citation under section a within the period of time prescribed by msha 
this results in an order of immediate withdrawal from the area of the mine affected by the condition until msha determines that the violation has been abated 
section d citations and orders citations and orders issued by msha under section d of the mine act for unwarrantable failure to comply with mandatory health or safety standards 
section b violations flagrant violations issued by msha under section b of the mine act 
section a orders orders issued by msha under section a of the mine act for situations in which msha determined an imminent danger as defined by msha existed 
pending legal actions pending legal actions before the commission as required to be reported by section a of the act 
the commission is an independent adjudicative agency that provides administrative trial and appellate review of legal disputes arising under the mine act 
these cases may involve  among other questions  challenges by operators to citations  orders and penalties they have received from msha or complaints of discrimination by miners under section of the mine act 
the following is a brief description of the types of legal actions that may be brought before the commission 
contests of citations and orders a contest proceeding may be filed with the commission by operators  miners or miners representatives to challenge the issuance of a citation or order issued by msha 
contests of proposed penalties petitions for assessment of penalties a contest of a proposed penalty is an administrative proceeding before the commission challenging a civil penalty that msha has proposed for the alleged violation contained in a citation or order 
the validity of the citation may also be challenged in this proceeding as well 
mine section citations sections b orders section d citations and orders section b violations section a orders proposed msha assessments us pending legal actions hycroft pattern or potential pattern of violations during the year ended december   hycroft did not receive written notice from msha of a a pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that are of such nature as could have significantly and substantially contributed to the cause and effect of mine health or safety hazards under section e of the mine act or b the potential to have such a pattern 
glossary amr means advance minimum royalty 
assay means to test minerals by chemical or other methods for the purpose of determining the amount of valuable metals contained 
breccia means rock consisting of fragments  more or less angular  in a matrix of finer grained material or of cementing material 
claim means a mining interest giving its holder the right to prospect  explore for and exploit minerals within a defined area 
cut off grade means the grade below which mineralized material will be considered waste 
deposit means an informal term for an accumulation of mineral ores 
development project is one which is engaged in the preparation of an established commercially mineable deposit for its extraction but which is not yet in production 
this stage occurs after completion of a feasibility study 
diamond drill means a rotary type of rock drill that cuts a core of rock and is recovered in long cylindrical sections  two centimeters or more in diameter 
the table above reflects citations and orders issued to us by msha during year ended december   and the pending legal actions before the commission as of december  the definition of mine under section of the mine act includes the mine  as well as other items used in  or to be used in  or resulting from  the work of extracting minerals  such as land  structures  facilities  equipment  machines  tools  and minerals preparation facilities 
two section citations and one section d citation and or orders were subject to contest as of december  represents the total dollar value of the proposed assessment from msha under the mine act pursuant to the citations and or orders preceding such dollar value in the corresponding row 

table of contents exploration projects is one which is engaged in the search for mineral deposits reserves  which are not in either the development or production stage 
fault means a fracture in rock along which there has been displacement of the two sides parallel to the fracture 
heap leach means a gold extraction method that percolates a cyanide solution through ore heaped on an impervious pad or base 
mineralization means the concentration of metals within a body of rock 
mineralized material is a body that contains mineralization which has been delineated by appropriately spaced drilling and or underground sampling to support a sufficient tonnage and average grade of metal s 
such a deposit does not qualify as a reserve until a comprehensive evaluation based upon unit cost  grade  recoveries  and other material factors conclude legal and economic feasibility

opt or oz ton means ounces per ton 
ore means material containing minerals that can be economically extracted 
ounce means a troy ounce

oxidation tends to make the ore more porous and permits a more complete permeation of cyanide solutions so that minute particles of gold in the interior of the minerals will be more readily dissolved 
probable reserves means reserves for which quantity and grade and or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves  but the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced 
the degree of assurance  although lower than that for proven reserves  is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 
production stage is one engaged in the exploitation of a mineral deposit reserve 
proven reserves means reserves for which a quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  trenches  workings or drill holes  grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and b the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size  shape  depth  and mineral content of reserves are well established 
recovery means that portion of the metal contained in the ore that is successfully extracted by processing  expressed as a percentage
