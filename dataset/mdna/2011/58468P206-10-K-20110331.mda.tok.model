table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion and analysis together with item selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth under the caption item a 
risk factors 
overview background we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring and developing novel  small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of diseases with unmet medical need with a specific focus on the us market 
through strategic alliances primarily with japanese pharmaceutical companies  we hold rights to a diversified portfolio of clinical and preclinical product candidates  each of which we believe has a well characterized and differentiated therapeutic profile  attractive commercial potential and patent assets having claims of commercially adequate scope 
we are a development stage company 
we have incurred significant net losses since our inception 
at december   from inception  our accumulated deficit was approximately million  including million of non cash stock based compensation charges related to employee stock based compensation and founders warrants 
we expect to incur substantial net losses for the next several years as we continue to develop certain of our existing product development programs  primarily mn for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma and copd exacerbations  and over the long term if we are successful in expanding our research and development programs and acquiring or in licensing products  technologies or businesses that are complementary to our own 
we have acquired licenses to eight compounds for the development of ten product candidates 
our development pipeline consists of eight product development programs which have been in clinical development for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma  diabetic neuropathic pain  opioid addiction  ms  bronchial asthma  ic  solid tumor cancers  generalized anxiety disorders insomnia  preterm labor and urinary incontinence  and two product development programs which have been in preclinical development for the treatment of thrombotic disorders 
in addition  we have expanded our development program for mn for the treatment of copd exacerbations 
in december we acquired avigen  a biopharmaceutical company that focused on identifying and developing differentiated products to treat patients with serious disorders  whose potential product candidate is av  a microphage migration inhibitor and a glial attenuator  for cns disorders  such as neuropathic pain  and opioid addiction and withdrawal and methamphetamine addiction 
avigen s av and our mn are both ibudilast  an orally available  small molecule therapeutic 
to date  we continue to integrate the two ibudilast based product development programs and pursue discussions with potential partners to secure a strategic collaboration to advance clinical development of the combined development programs 
avigen transaction on december   absolute merger  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours  merged with and into avigen  with avigen continuing as the surviving entity and wholly owned subsidiary of ours 
under the terms of the merger  we issued million in secured convertible notes that mature on june   the month anniversary of the closing of the merger 
holders of these convertible notes may convert their notes into our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share 
at the maturity of the convertible notes  the remaining holders would be paid out the same per share amount as the avigen shareholders that elected to 
table of contents receive cash at the merger closing  plus accrued interest 
as part of the merger consideration  the former avigen shareholders were also entitled to receive approximately per share  which was paid in two increments in  and rights under contingent payment rights issued as part of the merger consideration 
the amount to be paid in the two installments was net of a reconciliation of avigen expenses and a letter of credit after expiry 
under the first and second installments paid out  we paid  and  respectively  to avigen shareholders who elected payment in cash and we issued an additional principal amount of  and  respectively  in convertible notes to avigen shareholders who elected payment in convertible notes in lieu of a cash payment 
as a result of the avigen transaction  our consolidated financial statements include avigen s operations after the completion of the acquisition 
we accounted for the avigen merger using the acquisition method of accounting 
the acquisition method of accounting for acquired businesses requires  among other things  that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date and that the fair value of acquired in process research and development  or ipr d  be recorded on the balance sheet 
also  transaction costs are expensed as incurred 
as a result of the avigen transaction we recorded million of ipr d related to avigen s av asset and we originally recorded million of goodwill related to the excess purchase price over the assigned values of the net assets acquired 
with the reconciliation of expenses performed and the remaining amount of the letter of credit known upon expiry  goodwill was adjusted by approximately million to million to reflect the increase in liabilities assumed 
the goodwill was primarily a result of the conversion feature related to the convertible notes issued pursuant to the merger agreement 
our annual test date for ipr d and goodwill impairment is december we operate as one reporting segment and  during the year ended december  through the date of this report  there were no triggering events  market conditions such as a drop in our stock price by more than or other factors such as adverse clinical trial results that would indicate possible or actual impairment of ipr d or goodwill 
convertible notes at the closing of the avigen merger  we and american stock transfer trust company  llc  as trustee  entered into an indenture 
under the terms of a separate trust agreement  or trust agreement  million  which represents the first payment consideration less million paid out to avigen shareholders who elected cash payment and the initial principal amount of the convertible notes  or convertible notes  was deposited with a trust agent for the benefit of the holders and us the amount of such deposit together with interest accrued and capitalized thereon  the property 
provided no event of default has occurred and is continuing  we will be able to direct the investment and reinvestment of the property in certain approved investment options  including certain money market funds 
at the maturity of the convertible notes on june   the month anniversary of the closing of the merger  we plan to use the property to pay the principal amount of  and accrued interest on  the convertible notes 
the convertible notes are our secured obligations  and the indenture does not limit other indebtedness of ours  secured or unsecured 
the indenture contains limited covenants  including a requirement that we deliver to holders of the convertible notes quarterly statements setting forth the principal amount of the convertible notes at the close of the fiscal quarter as well as information regarding the amount of interest capitalized to such convertible notes during the fiscal quarter 
holders of the convertible notes may submit conversion notices  which are irrevocable  instructing the trustee to convert such convertible notes into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share 
following each conversion date  which date generally is the final business day of each calendar month  we will issue the number of whole shares of common stock issuable upon conversion as promptly as practicable and in any event within business days 
any fractional shares after aggregating all convertible notes being converted by a holder on such date will be rounded down and we will deliver cash out of the separate trust for the current market value of the fractional share 
the indenture includes customary anti dilution adjustments and events of default 

table of contents contingent payment rights at the closing of the avigen merger  we  avigen and american stock transfer trust company  llc  as rights agent  entered into a contingent payment rights agreement  or cpr agreement 
the cpr agreement sets forth the rights that former avigen stockholders have with respect to each cpr held after the closing of the merger 
the cpr agreement provides for the payment of the following amounts on a pro rata basis if the first milestone payment under avigen s agreement with genzyme  or the genzyme agreement  is received before august    or such lesser cash amount paid by genzyme  if the first milestone payment has not occurred and the parkinson s product  as defined in the genzyme agreement  is sold or otherwise disposed of by us before august   percent of the net proceeds of such sale or disposition received before august   and if the trust established pursuant to the avigen mtp is terminated  the amount remaining in such trust upon termination less any payments required to be made under avigen s management transition plan trust agreement  such amount currently estimated at  as of december   the avigen mtp has not been terminated 
all payments will be made on a pro rata basis 
in each case  the payments will be net of any related taxes and out of pocket costs  damages  fines  penalties and expenses incurred by us 
the contingent payment rights are not transferable  except in limited circumstances 
revenues and cost of revenues we recognized no revenues for each of the years in the three year period ended december  research and development our research and development expenses consist primarily of the license fees related to our product candidates  salaries and related employee benefits  costs associated with the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates  costs associated with non clinical activities  such as regulatory expenses  and pre commercialization manufacturing development activities 
we use external service providers to manufacture our product candidates to be used in clinical trials and for the majority of the services performed in connection with the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates  therefore  these research and development expenses consist substantially of external costs  such as fees paid to consultants  contract research organizations  contract manufacturers and other external service providers  including professional fees and costs associated with legal services  patents and patent applications for our intellectual property 
internal research and development expenses consist of costs of compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel  supplies  materials  facility costs and depreciation 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred or accrued based on certain contractual factors such as for estimates of work performed  milestones achieved  patient enrollment and experience with similar contracts 
as actual costs become known  accruals are adjusted 
to date  our yearly budget estimates have not differed significantly from the actual costs incurred 

table of contents the following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the periods indicated for each of our product candidates 
to the extent that costs  including personnel costs  are not tracked to a specific product development program  such costs are included in the unallocated category in thousands product candidate disease indication year ended december  mn acute exacerbations of asthma and copd mn av multiple sclerosis other cns disorders mn bronchial asthma mn interstitial cystitis mn solid tumors mn generalized anxiety disorder insomnia mn preterm labor mn urinary incontinence mn thrombotic disorders mn thrombotic disorders unallocated total research and development as of the end of the second quarter of  we determined to focus our resources on the development of our two prioritized product candidates  mn for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma and mn for the treatment of ms 
in the third quarter of  we determined to expand the product development program for mn to evaluate mn for the treatment of copd exacerbations 
in the second quarter of  we completed the phase ii clinical trial of mn ibudilast for the treatment of ms and in december  through the avigen acquisition  we acquired av ibudilast for the treatment of other cns disorders neuropathic pain  opioid addiction and withdrawal and methamphetamine addiction 
to date  we continue to work on combining the two ibudilast based development programs and we are pursuing discussions with potential partners to secure a strategic collaboration 
as such  we do not plan to undertake any further significant clinical development of mn av until such time that we secure a strategic collaboration to advance the combined ibudilast based development program 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses will increase with respect to mn over the next few quarters as we strive to complete the current clinical trial  mn cl in the second half of in addition  with respect to mn av  in future periods  we will limit expenditures on this product candidate to those development activities deemed necessary  if any  to maximize its value for purposes of securing a partner for clinical development 
we intend to limit our expenditures on the remainder of our existing product candidates to only those activities deemed necessary to maintain our license rights or maximize the value of such product candidates  if any  while pursuing a variety of initiatives to monetize such product candidates on appropriate terms 
as a result  we expect that research and development expenses will decrease or otherwise remain low for the remainder of our existing product candidates in future periods 
these eight non prioritized product development programs consist of the following mn for the treatment of bronchial asthma  for which we initiated a phase iii clinical program in the fourth quarter of that we subsequently terminated in the second quarter of and for which we developed prototypes of once per day oral dosing formulations  mn for the treatment of ic  for which we completed a phase ii clinical trial in the first quarter of  mn for the treatment of solid tumors  for which we completed one phase i clinical trial in the second quarter of and one phase i clinical trial in the fourth quarter of  
table of contents mn for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder insomnia  for which we completed a phase ii clinical trial for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in the second quarter of and a phase ii clinical trial for the treatment of insomnia in the fourth quarter of  mn for the treatment of preterm labor  for which we completed a phase i clinical trial to investigate the pharmacokinetic profile of mn in healthy pregnant women not in labor in the second quarter of mn for the treatment of urinary incontinence  for which we completed a phase i clinical trial in the fourth quarter of and a phase i food effects study in the first quarter of  mn for the treatment of thrombotic disorders  which remains in preclinical development  and mn for the treatment of thrombotic disorders  which remains in preclinical development 
general and administrative our general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries  benefits and consulting and professional fees related to our administrative  finance  human resources  business development  legal and information systems support functions 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include facilities and insurance costs 
general and administrative costs are expensed as incurred or accrued based on monitoring the status of the specified project  contractual factors such as milestones or retainer fees  services provided and invoices received 
as actual costs become known to us  we adjust our accruals 
to date  general and administrative accruals have not differed significantly from the actual costs incurred 
we anticipate that our general and administrative expenses may increase in future periods if we are required to expand our infrastructure based on the success of our current prioritized product development programs and in raising capital to support those and other development programs or otherwise in connection with increased business development activities related to partnering  out licensing or disposition of our product candidates 
long term debt on may   we entered into a loan and security agreement  or the loan agreement  with oxford  under which we borrowed million 
the financing is used to satisfy working capital needs  including the continued clinical development of mn we are required to pay interest on borrowings on a monthly basis through and including february  beginning march  through maturity of the loan on august   we will be required to make payments of outstanding principal and interest in equal monthly installments 
the stated interest rate on the loan is percent 
the effective interest rate on the loan was percent when taking into consideration the deferred interest payment  the relative fair value of the warrants issued in connection with the loan and the fees associated with procuring the loan 
pursuant to the loan agreement  we also issued to oxford a warrant to acquire up to  shares of our common stock  par value per share  at an exercise price of per share 
based on a black scholes model  the relative fair value of the warrant was approximately  in addition  the warrant and debt instrument are immediately separable and were issued separately  thus  we accounted for the warrant as a component of stockholders equity as the agreement requires settlement in shares and under no provision of the agreement are we required to settle the warrant in cash 
we paid oxford a facility fee of  and we paid outside third parties fees of approximately  we will also pay oxford a deferred interest payment equal to  payable on september   provided that a pro rata portion of such deferred interest payment shall be paid upon any prepayment of the loan 
in addition  if we prepay all or a portion of the loan prior to maturity  we will pay oxford a prepayment penalty of three percent of the total amount prepaid if the prepayment occurs prior to may   two percent of the total amount prepaid if the prepayment occurs between may  and may  and one percent of the total amount prepaid if the prepayment occurs on or after may  
table of contents we accounted for the interest on the long term debt under the effective interest method wherein we treated the debt issuance costs paid directly to oxford and the fair value of the warrants issued to oxford as a discount on the debt or a contra liability and we treated the debt issuance costs paid to third parties as an asset 
the related amortization of the debt discount is recorded as interest expense and the amortization of the debt issuance costs paid to third parties is recorded as other expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  the loan agreement contains covenants that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness  create liens  enter into certain merger and licensing transactions  dispose of certain of our assets  enter into certain fundamental corporate changes  make certain types of investments  and make certain payments and distributions 
the loan agreement requires that  on or before march   we must have either i entered into a collaboration  joint venture or partnership with a non affiliate providing for up front cash proceeds to us with such proceeds received on or before march  of not less than million from either or a combination of an upfront payment s or proceeds from the sale or conversion of our securities issued in connection therewith or ii received positive phase iib data on mn  as defined in a completed partnership or joint venture agreement relating to mn  or had a positive end of phase ii meeting with the fda and obtained the approval of the board of directors to proceed to phase iii with mn we do not anticipate achieving either of these affirmative covenants by march  and oxford has agreed to waive early payment penalties of approximately  if we repay the loan in full on april  see notes to consolidated financial statements note  subsequent events  for further information on the oxford loan 
investment securities and ars put our investment securities had consisted of auction rate securities  or ars  all of which had aaa ratings at the time of original purchase 
ars are generally long term debt instruments that historically have provided liquidity through a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  typically seven   or days 
all of our ars principally represent insurance notes and portfolios of securities primarily commercial paper 
in august  ubs  the brokerage firm through which we purchased the majority of our investment securities  all of which were ars entered into a settlement with the sec  the new york attorney general and other state agencies 
under the settlement  we received the right to sell to ubs the ars held in accounts with ubs at par value at any time during the period beginning june  and ending july  the right to sell the ars back to ubs is considered an ars put 
as part of the settlement  ubs also offered to us a no net cost loan program  or ars loan  whereby we would be able to borrow up to percent of the market value  as determined by ubs at its sole discretion  of our ars that have been pledged as collateral at an interest cost that would not exceed the interest being paid on the underlying ars investments 
we measured the ubs ars on a level basis  as defined by asc  using a discounted cash flow valuation model  employing liquidity discounts and assumptions made regarding interest rate and maturity 

table of contents we elected to measure the ars put under the fair value option of asc  authoritative guidance on financial instruments formerly sfas no 
 to mitigate the volatility in reported earnings due to the linkage of certain of our ars and the ars put 
under asc  any subsequent increase or decrease in the fair value of the ars put would be recorded as either a gain or an impairment charge  respectively  in our consolidated statement of operations 
the fair value of the ars put was also determined by a discounted cash flow valuation model with assumptions being made related to interest rate  maturity and liquidity 
on december   we designated our investment securities portfolio as trading investment securities  therefore  any additional increase or decrease in the fair value of our investment securities is recorded as either a gain or an impairment charge  respectively  in our consolidated statement of operations 
we exercised our ars put on june  upon settlement of the ars put in july  the ubs ars were redeemed at par value by ubs and the associated ars loan was repaid  which resulted in a net gain of approximately  being recorded in our consolidated statement of operations related to the redemption of the ubs ars and ars put 
therefore  as of december   we no longer held any investment securities originally purchased by ubs and we no longer held the ars put 
in the third quarter of  we reclassified our long term investment securities to current investment securities because we no longer had the intent to hold these securities for more than a year 
in addition  the fair market value of these investment securities were no longer determined on a level basis based on a discounted cash flow model employing liquidity discounts  but rather on a level basis  as defined by asc  based on indicative liquidation quotes in an inactive market 
during the twelve months ended december   we recorded impairment charges of  on these investment securities to write them down to fair market value based on the indicative quotes received from third party brokers 
all impairment charges were recorded in our consolidated statement of operations in the current year 
as of december   we no longer held any investment securities 
foreign exchange loss gain to date  we have conducted most of our clinical trials in the united states 
however  the phase ii clinical trial for mn for the treatment of ms that was completed in was conducted in eastern europe and the ongoing phase ii clinical trial in mn for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma has a small number of clinical sites located in canada  australia and new zealand in which certain of the invoices are denominated in the canadian dollar  the australian dollar and the new zealand dollar  respectively 
in addition  we have certain investor relation invoices denominated in japanese yen and we have certain manufacturing invoices denominated in british pounds 
at this time  we have not established a hedging program to mitigate our foreign exchange exposure 
foreign exchange gain loss is based on the difference between the exchange rate at the settlement date and the exchange rate at the balance sheet date 
other expense other expense consists of accretion related to the convertible notes and the amortization of debt issuance costs paid to third parties 
interest expense interest expense consists of interest charged on our ars loan  interest charged on our long term debt based on the effective interest method and amortization of debt discount 
other income other income consists of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and ars 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  as well as the revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis  including those related to our significant accruals 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our most critical accounting estimates include our recognition of research and development expenses  which impacts operating expenses and accrued liabilities  and stock based compensation  which impacts operating expenses 
we review our estimates  judgments and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period in which they are deemed to be necessary 
we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to the judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of costs incurred to further our research and development activities and include salaries and related employee benefits  costs associated with clinical trials  costs associated with non clinical activities such as toxicology testing  regulatory activities  research related overhead expenses and fees paid to external service providers who conduct certain research and development activities on our behalf 
we use external service providers and vendors to conduct clinical trials  to manufacture product candidates to be used in clinical trials and to provide various other products and services related to our product development programs 
research and development expenses also include fees for licensed technology for which technological feasibility has not been established and there are no alternative uses 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred or accrued based on certain contractual factors such as for estimates of work performed  milestones achieved  patient enrollment and experience with similar contracts 
as actual costs become known  accruals are adjusted 
to date  our estimates have not differed significantly from the actual costs incurred 
stock based compensation we grant options to purchase our common stock to our employees and directors under our amended and restated stock incentive plan 
additionally  we have outstanding stock options that were granted under our general stock incentive plan 
the benefits provided under both of these plans requires stock based compensation for an award of equity instruments  including stock options and employee stock purchase rights  issued to employees to be recognized as a cost in the consolidated financial statements 
the cost of these awards is measured according to the grant date fair value of the stock award and is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  which is usually the vesting period 
in the absence of an observable market price for the stock award  the grant date fair value of the award would be based upon a valuation methodology that takes into consideration various factors  including the exercise price of the award  the expected term of the award  the current price of the underlying shares  the expected volatility of the underlying share price  the expected dividends on the underlying shares and the risk free interest rate 
valuation of our stock option grants require us to estimate certain variables  such as estimated volatility and expected life 
if any of our estimations change  such changes could have a significant impact on the stock based compensation amount we recognize 

table of contents stock option compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the underlying option  generally four years 
business combinations our consolidated financial statements include an acquired business operations after the completion of the acquisition 
we account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting 
the acquisition method of accounting for acquired businesses requires  among other things  that most assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date and that the fair value of acquired in process research and development  or ipr d  be recorded on the balance sheet 
also  transaction costs are expensed as incurred 
any excess of the purchase price over the assigned values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note avigen transaction for further information on ipr d and goodwill 
fair value measurements we are required to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value  either upon initial measurement or for subsequent accounting or reporting 
we use fair value extensively in the initial measurement of net assets acquired in a business combination and when accounting for and reporting on investment securities and certain financial instruments or assets 
we estimate fair value using an exit price approach  which requires  among other things  that we determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly market of market participants  considering the highest and best use of assets and  for liabilities  assuming the risk of non performance will be the same before and after the transfer 
many  but not all  of our financial instruments are carried at fair value 
in addition  as required under accounting rules for business combinations  the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from avigen on december  have been recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date 
for additional information on the valuation approach to determine fair value  including a description of the inputs used  see long lived assets below and notes to consolidated financial statements note avigen transaction 
also  for information on fair value for our financial instruments  see notes to consolidated financial statements note fair value measurements other than intangibles and goodwill 
long lived assets and impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets  including property and equipment  and other intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable and we perform impairment testing for goodwill and ipr d annually 
when it is determined that impairment has occurred  a charge to operations will be recorded 
impairment on property and equipment or other intangible assets  if any  is assessed using discounted cash flows 
impairment on goodwill is assessed on our overall market capitalization  as we operate under one reporting segment 
impairment on ipr d is assessed on a fair value cost approach 
new accounting standards adopted in october  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  ratified accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 which eliminates the residual method of allocation and the requirement to use the relative selling price method when allocating revenue in a multiple deliverable arrangement 
when applying the relative selling price method  the selling price for each deliverable shall be determined using vendor specific objective evidence of selling price  if it exists  otherwise third party evidence of selling price 
if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence of selling price exists for a deliverable  companies shall use its best estimate of the selling price for that deliverable when applying the relative selling price method 
asu shall be effective in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with earlier application permitted 
companies may elect to adopt this guidance prospectively for all revenue arrangements entered into or materially 
table of contents modified after the date of adoption  or retrospectively for all periods presented 
the adoption of this accounting standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
in march  the fasb issued asu no 
 derivatives and hedging topic scope exception related to embedded credit derivatives 
the fasb believes this asu clarifies the type of embedded credit derivative that is exempt from embedded derivative bifurcation requirements 
specifically  only one form of embedded credit derivative qualifies for the exemption one that is related only to the subordination of one financial instrument to another 
as a result  entities that have contracts containing an embedded credit derivative feature in a form other than such subordination may need to separately account for the embedded credit derivative feature 
the amendments in the asu are effective for each reporting entity at the beginning of its first fiscal quarter beginning after june  the adoption of this accounting standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
in april  fasb issued asu no 
 which indicates that the sec staff would not object to incorporating the effects of the health care and education reconciliation act of which was enacted on march  when accounting for the patient protection and affordable care act which was enacted on march  
this view is based partly on the sec s understanding that the two aforementioned acts  when taken together  represent the current health care reforms as passed by congress and signed by the president 
we have performed an initial review of the two acts and do not believe that either will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
our belief is based on the fact that i we are a development stage biopharmaceutical whose lead drug candidates are in phase ii of development and we have no other revenue generating products  therefore the pharmaceutical industry fee should not be applicable to us  nor would we be impacted by the drug subsidy changes  ii we have less than employees so the fee for health plans will have minimal impact to our operating expenses  iii we do not have high cost coverage health plans  nor do we offer retiree medical benefits  thus  the fees and the changes related to these would not impact our operating expenses  and iv with regard to the limit on tax deductible employee compensation  this should not impact our tax position as we are currently a net loss company and will continue to be a net loss company in the foreseeable future 
the health care reforms also provide for a new investment tax credit for qualified therapeutic discovery  for which we submitted an application on july  in october  we were notified that our application for a grant payment under the investment tax credit for qualified therapeutic discovery was not approved by the department of health and human services 
in april  the fasb issued asu no 
 which codifies the consensus reached in eitf no 
 which provides guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research or development transactions 
consideration that is contingent on achievement of a milestone in its entirety may be recognized as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone is judged to meet certain criteria to be considered substantive 
milestones should be considered substantive in their entirety and may not be bifurcated 
an arrangement may contain both substantive and nonsubstantive milestones  and each milestone should be evaluated individually to determine if it is substantive 
the amendments in this asu are effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after june  the adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 fees paid to the federal government by pharmaceutical manufacturers which provides guidance concerning the recognition and classification of the new annual fee payable by branded prescription drug manufacturers and importers on branded prescription drugs which was mandated under the health care reform legislation enacted in the us in march under this new accounting standard  the annual fee would be presented as a component of operating expenses and recognized over the calendar year such fees are payable using a straight line method of allocation unless another method 
table of contents better allocates the fee over the calendar year 
this asu is effective for calendar years beginning on or after december   when the fee initially becomes effective 
the adoption of this accounting standard will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
internal controls material weakness remediation as of december   management believes that the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that was included in item of our form q for the quarter ended september  has been effectively remediated 
prior to the quarter ended december   the remediation measures as described below were implemented 
we have taken appropriate actions to remediate the material weakness related to the identified control overrides and policy deviations by one of our senior executive officers  which  collectively  represented a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting 
our remediation plan included disclosing the granting of a waiver under our code of conduct to a senior executive and another employee due to the appearance of a possible conflict of interest  re aligning certain reporting structures  updating our contract review and approval policy to require one signatory to be our chief financial officer  strengthening certain human resource policies by amending our compensation committee charter and creating a strategic and oversight committee comprised of certain board members and the senior management team to review key issues 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and revenues there were no revenues for the years ended december  or december  research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease in research and development expenses was due to a decrease of million in spending on our prioritized asset mn for the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma  primarily due to the completion of the clinical trial evaluating mn at planned escalating doses in patients with severe acute exacerbations of asthma treated in emergency departments in  a decrease of million primarily in unallocated r d expenses due to a reduction in personnel costs and a reduction in intellectual property legal costs related to the overall review of our patent portfolio  offset by an increase in spending of million primarily to complete the clinical trial  principally funded by the national institute in drug addiction  in our other prioritized asset mn av ibudilast for the treatment of opioid withdrawal

in addition  during the year ended december    of interest expense was recorded on the ars loan 
liquidity and capital resources we incurred losses of   and  for the years ended december    and respectively 
we have an accumulated deficit of  as of december  additionally  we have used net cash of   and  to fund our operating activities for the years ended december    and  respectively 
to date these operating losses have been funded primarily through the private placement of our equity securities  the public sale of our common stock  long term debt  the conversion of convertible notes to our common stock and the exercise of founders warrants  net of treasury stock repurchases 
during  we expanded our phase ii clinical trial mn cl activities while simultaneously pursuing available financing sources to support operations 
we have had  and continue to have  an ongoing need 
table of contents to raise additional cash from outside sources to fund our operations 
if we are to be successful  we must raise outside capital in the future 
if we cannot do so  we will be required to further reduce our research  development  and administrative operations  including reductions of our employee base  in order to offset the lack of available funding 
as a development stage company  we have consumed substantial amounts of capital since our inception 
we do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures  however  we have an ongoing patient phase ii clinical trial mn cl for which we expect to complete enrollment in the third quarter of our clinical studies are administered by third party cros and there is a significant degree of estimation involved in quantifying the expense associated with clinical trial activity 
we accrue costs for work performed by cros based on the achievement of contracted milestone activities and on internal estimates of activities using patient enrollment and contractual or estimated rates during the period 
if we do not receive complete and accurate information from the cro or third parties on a timely basis or correctly estimate the outcome of contract negotiations  activity levels and the enrollment rate  this could potentially impact r d expense and cash payments in subsequent periods 
we have had  and continue to have  an ongoing need to raise additional cash from outside sources to fund our operations 
we are pursuing financing opportunities in both the private and public debt and equity markets as well as through strategic corporate partnerships 
we have an established history of raising capital through equity and debt  and we are currently involved in discussions with multiple parties 
in march  we raised approximately million in gross proceeds approximately million  net of underwriting discount and underwriter expenses from a firm underwritten public offering in which we offered  units  with each unit consisting of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of common stock 
the purchase price for each unit was and each warrant has an exercise price of per share 
in addition  in march  the underwriter exercised  units of its  unit overallotment 
as of march   our cash and cash equivalents  along with the proceeds from our recent offering  are our principal sources of liquidity 
our business will continue to require us to incur substantial research and development expenses and our business plan assumes that we will use approximately million of our cash resources to fund repayment of our loan from oxford on april   as agreed upon by oxford and us in an executed pay off letter dated march  we also have assumed that all of our restricted cash will be used to pay our convertible notes that mature on june   although one or more holders may elect to convert some or all of the convertible notes to common stock at a conversion rate of per share prior to the maturity date 
we believe our current liquidity position will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
we expect to utilize our cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations  including research and development of our product development candidates and for clinical trials 
additionally  we believe that without additional sources of financing  we do not currently have adequate funding to complete the research and development and clinical trials required to bring our future products to market  therefore  we will require significant additional funding 
if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to raise additional funds  we will be required to significantly reduce or curtail our future research and development activities and other operations 

table of contents other significant cash and contractual obligations the following summarizes our scheduled long term contractual obligations that may affect our future liquidity as of december  in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases license obligations convertible notes due notes payable due escrow agreement total under the license agreements for our product candidates  we may be required to make future payments based upon the occurrence of certain milestones related to clinical development  regulatory or commercial events 
we will also be required to pay royalties on any net sales of the licensed products  if any are approved by the fda or foreign regulatory authorities for commercial sale 
these milestone payments and royalty payments under our license agreements are not included in the table above because we cannot determine when  or if  the related milestones will be achieved or the events triggering the commencement of payment obligations will occur at present 
these were initially recorded at fair value which is less than face value due to a lack of marketability discount employed in the binomial option pricing model we used to value these contractual obligations 
the carrying values of these contractual obligations have been adjusted to reflect payments  interest  conversions into common stock and accretion  accordingly 
the contractual obligations are based on the stated amortization schedule  assuming no event of default 
we also enter into agreements with third parties to conduct our clinical trials  manufacture our product candidates  perform data collection and analysis and other services in connection with our product development programs 
our payment obligations under these agreements depend upon the progress of our product development programs 
therefore  we are unable at this time to estimate with certainty the future costs we will incur under these agreements 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any relationship with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance variable interest  or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we did not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we do not have relationships and transactions with persons and entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties except as disclosed herein 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on investment securities 
as of december   we had no investment securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive without significantly increasing risk 
our risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investments in interest rate sensitive financial instruments if any 

table of contents under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments due to their relatively short term nature 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income  while increases in interest rates over time will increase our interest income 
cash and cash equivalents as of december  were million and were primarily invested in money market interest bearing accounts and money market funds 
a hypothetical adverse change in the average interest rate on our money market cash investments and short term investments would have had no material effect on net income for the year ended december
