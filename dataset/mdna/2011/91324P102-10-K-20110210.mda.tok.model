item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview business trends health care reforms 
as a payer in various government health care programs  we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding  enrollments  payment adjustments and audits that could adversely affect our revenues  cash flows and results of operations 
we participate in various federal  state and local government health care coverage programs  including as a payer in medicare advantage  medicare part d  various medicaid programs and chip  and receive revenues from these programs 
these programs generally are subject to frequent changes  including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible  reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels  or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs 
for example  in  cms implemented a reduction in medicare advantage reimbursements of approximately for  and as part of the health reform legislation  medicare advantage payment rates for were frozen at levels 
separately  cms implemented a reduction in medicare advantage reimbursements of for beginning in  additional cuts to medicare advantage plans will take effect  with changes being phased in over two to six years  depending on the level of payment reduction in a county 
although we have adjusted members benefits and premiums on a selective basis  terminated benefit plans in certain counties  and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to these rate reductions  there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute successfully on these or other strategies to address changes in the medicare advantage program 
as part of the health reform legislation  cms has developed a system whereby plans that meet certain quality ratings will be entitled to various quality bonus payments  and there can be no assurance that our plans will meet these quality ratings 
our results of operations  financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by funding reductions  or if our plans do not meet the requirements to receive quality bonus payments 
our participation in the medicare advantage  medicare part d  and various medicaid and chip programs occurs through bids that are submitted periodically 
revenues for these programs are dependent upon periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various 
table of contents payment mechanisms 
funding for these government programs is dependent upon many factors outside of our control  including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level  and general political issues and priorities 
a reduction or less than expected increase in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
cms uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding for medicare programs  including adjusting monthly capitation payments to medicare advantage and medicare part d plans according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers 
in  cms announced that it will perform risk adjustment data validation radv audits of selected medicare health plans each year to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers  and certain of our local plans have been selected for audit 
these audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to health plans 
in december  cms published for public comment a new proposed radv audit and payment adjustment methodology 
the proposed methodology contains provisions allowing retroactive contract level payment adjustments for the year audited using an extrapolation of the error rate identified in audit samples 
depending on the methodology utilized  potential payment adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
in addition  we are in discussions with the office of inspector general for hhs regarding audits of our risk adjustment data for two local plans 
we are unable to predict the outcome of these audits and discussions 
however  any payment adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for additional information regarding these audits 
in  as part of arra and in an effort to relieve pressure resulting from state fiscal problems and rising medicaid enrollments  congress increased the federal medical assistance percentage fmap  temporarily increasing federal funding for state medicaid programs 
the enhanced fmap was set to expire at the end of federal legislation was passed in august that extended additional enhanced fmap funding through june the ability of states to sustain their medicaid programs may be adversely affected if congress does not continue the enhanced fmap beyond june  which could result in a reduction of the scope of the programs  member disenrollment  rate reductions or other adverse actions 
under the medicaid managed care program  state medicaid agencies are periodically required by federal law to seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care medicaid health programs 
if we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state medicaid managed care contracts  we risk losing the members that were enrolled in those medicaid plans 
under the medicare part d program  to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members  our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a threshold  which is calculated by the government after our bids are submitted 
if the enrollee premium is not below the government threshold  we risk losing the members who were auto assigned to us and we will not have additional members auto assigned to us 
for example  we lost approximately  of our auto enrolled low income subsidy members in because certain of our bids exceeded thresholds set by the government 
in general  our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment  utilization  medical costs  and other factors 
in the event any of these assumptions are materially incorrect  either as a result of unforeseen changes to the medicare program or other programs on which we bid  or our competitors submit bids that are more favorable than our bids  our results of operations could be materially affected 
if we fail to comply with requirements of privacy and security regulations  including taking steps to ensure that our third party service providers who obtain access to sensitive personal information maintain its confidentiality and security  our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected 
the collection  maintenance  protection  use  transmission  disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information by our businesses are regulated at the international  federal and state levels 
these laws and rules are subject to change by legislation or administrative or judicial interpretation 
various state laws address the use and disclosure of sensitive personal information to the extent they are more restrictive than those contained in the 
table of contents privacy and security provisions in the federal glba and in hipaa 
hipaa now requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements 
see item  business government regulation for a discussion of various federal and state privacy laws and regulations governing our businesses 
even though we provide for appropriate protections through our contracts with our third party service providers and in certain cases assess their security controls  we still have limited control over their actions and practices 
privacy and security requirements regarding sensitive personal information are also imposed on us through controls with our customers 
in addition  despite the security measures we have in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules  our facilities and systems and those of our third party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches  acts of vandalism or theft  computer viruses  misplaced or lost data  programming and or human errors or other similar events 
compliance with new privacy and security laws  requirements  and new regulations  such as arra  will result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes including further implementation of encryption and other data protection standards  new limitations or constraints on our business models  the development of new administrative processes  the effects of potential noncompliance by our third party service providers  and increased enforcement actions and fines and penalties 
they also may impose further restrictions on our collection  disclosure and use of sensitive personal information that is housed in one or more of our administrative databases 
we are awaiting final hhs regulations for many key aspects of the arra amendments to hipaa 
noncompliance with any privacy or security laws and regulations or any security breach involving the misappropriation  loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive personal information  whether by us or by one of our third party service providers  could have a material adverse effect on our business  reputation and results of operations  including mandatory disclosure to the media  significant increase in the number and cost of managing and remediating data security incidents  increased enforcement actions  material fines and penalties  compensatory  special  punitive  and statutory damages  litigation  consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices  adverse actions against our licenses to do business  and injunctive relief 
our businesses providing pbm services face regulatory and other risks and uncertainties associated with the pbm industry that may differ from the risks of our business of providing managed care and health insurance products 
we provide pbm services through our prescription solutions and unitedhealthcare businesses 
each business is subject to federal and state anti kickback and other laws that govern their relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers  customers and consumers 
in addition  federal and state legislatures regularly consider new regulations for the industry that could adversely affect current industry practices  including the receipt or required disclosure of rebates from pharmaceutical companies  the development and use of formularies  and the use of average wholesale prices 
see item  business government regulation for a discussion of various federal and state laws and regulations governing our pbm businesses 
our pbm businesses provide services to sponsors of health benefit plans that are subject to erisa 
the dol  which is the agency that enforces erisa  could assert that the fiduciary obligations imposed by the statute apply to some or all of the services provided by our pbm businesses even where our pbm businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations 
in the event a court were to determine that fiduciary obligations apply to our pbm businesses in connection with services for which our pbm businesses are not contractually obligated to assume fiduciary obligations  we could be subject to claims for breaches of fiduciary obligations or entering into certain prohibited transactions 
prescription solutions also conducts business as a mail order pharmacy and specialty pharmacy  which subjects it to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations 
the failure to adhere to these laws and regulations could expose prescription solutions to civil and criminal penalties 
further  prescription solutions is subject to the payment card industry data security standards  which is a multifaceted security standard that includes requirements for security management  policies  procedures  network architecture  software design and other critical protective measures to protect customer account data as mandated by the credit card brands 
the failure to adhere to such standards could expose prescription solutions to liability or impact their ability to process credit card transactions 

table of contents in addition  our pbm businesses would be adversely affected by an inability to contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers  and could face potential claims in connection with purported errors by our mail order or specialty pharmacies  including in connection with the risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other health care products 
disruptions at any of our mail order or specialty pharmacies due to failure of technology or any other failure or disruption to these systems or to the infrastructure due to fire  electrical outage  natural disaster  acts of terrorism or some other catastrophic event could reduce our ability to process and dispense prescriptions and provide products and services to customers 
if we fail to compete effectively to maintain or increase our market share  including maintaining or increasing enrollments in businesses providing health benefits  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our businesses compete throughout the united states and face competition in all of the geographic markets in which we operate 
we compete with other companies on the basis of many factors  including price of benefits offered and cost and risk of alternatives  location and choice of health care providers  quality of customer service  comprehensiveness of coverage offered  reputation for quality care  financial stability and diversity of product offerings 
for our health benefits reporting segment  competitors include aetna inc  cigna corporation  coventry health care  inc  health net  inc  humana inc  kaiser permanente  wellpoint  inc  numerous for profit and not for profit organizations operating under licenses from the blue cross blue shield association and other enterprises that serve more limited geographic areas or market segments such as medicare specialty services 
for our prescription solutions business  competitors include medco health solutions  inc  cvs caremark corporation and express scripts  inc our optumhealth and ingenix reporting segments also compete with a broad and diverse set of other businesses 
in particular markets  competitors may have greater capabilities  resources or market share  a more established reputation  superior supplier or health care professional arrangements  existing business relationships  or other factors that give such competitors a competitive advantage 
in addition  significant merger and acquisition activity has occurred in the industries in which we operate  both as to our competitors and suppliers including hospitals  physician groups and other care professionals in these industries 
consolidation may make it more difficult for us to retain or increase customers  to improve the terms on which we do business with our suppliers  or to maintain or advance profitability 
if we do not compete effectively in our markets  if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets  if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively  if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers  if we do not provide a satisfactory level of services  if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect  if membership or demand for other services declines  or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products  our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
adverse economic conditions could adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations 
adverse economic conditions may continue to impact demand for certain of our products and services 
for example  decreases in employment have caused and could continue to cause lower enrollment in our employer group plans  lower enrollment in our non employer individual plans and a higher number of employees opting out of our employer group plans 
adverse economic conditions have caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary  employee funded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs 
in addition  adverse economic conditions could continue to negatively impact our employer group renewal prospects and our ability to increase premiums and could result in cancellation of products and services by our customers 
all of these could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  a prolonged adverse economic environment could negatively impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers  which could adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings 

table of contents during a prolonged adverse economic environment  state and federal budgets could be adversely affected  resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs  including medicare  medicaid and chip 
a reduction in state medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retrospectively to payments already negotiated and or received from the government and could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
in addition  the state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the government to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs  such as premium taxes on insurance companies and health maintenance organizations and surcharges on select fee for service and capitated medical claims  and could adversely affect our results of operations 
if we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with physicians  hospitals  and other health care providers  our business could be adversely affected 
we contract with physicians  hospitals  pharmaceutical benefit service providers  pharmaceutical manufacturers  and other health care providers for competitive prices and services 
our results of operations and prospects are substantially dependent on our continued ability to maintain these competitive prices and services 
failure to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers  whether in network or out of network  could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
in any particular market  physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract  demand higher payments  or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs  less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements 
in some markets  certain health care providers  particularly hospitals  physician hospital organizations or multi specialty physician groups  may have significant market positions or near monopolies that could result in diminished bargaining power on our part 
in addition  physician or practice management companies  which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage  may compete directly with us 
if these providers refuse to contract with us  use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage  our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected 
in addition  we have capitation arrangements with some physicians  hospitals and other health care providers 
under the typical arrangement  the health care provider receives a fixed percentage of premium to cover all or a defined portion of the medical costs provided to the capitated member 
under some capitated arrangements  the provider may also receive additional compensation from risk sharing and other incentive arrangements 
capitation arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs  but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the professional 
to the extent that a capitated health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the capitation arrangement  we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims that should have been the responsibility of the capitated health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider under the capitation arrangement 
further  payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members 
there can be no assurance that health care providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services  maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers 
any of these events could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 
some providers that render services to our members do not have contracts with us 
in those cases  we do not have a pre established understanding about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider for services rendered to our members 
in some states  the amount of compensation due to these out of network providers is defined by law or regulation  but in most instances  it is either not defined or it is established by a standard that does not clearly specify dollar terms 
in some instances  providers may believe that they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us or try to recover from our members the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged us 
for example  we are involved in litigation with out of network providers that is described in more detail in litigation matters in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the success of certain optumhealth businesses depends on maintaining physician relationships 
the primary care physicians that practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us 
if we are unable to maintain satisfactory relationships with primary care physicians  or to retain enrollees following the departure of a physician  our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  physicians  hospitals  pharmaceutical benefit service providers  pharmaceutical manufacturers  and certain health care providers are customers of our health services businesses 
given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses  failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
sales of our products and services are dependent on our ability to attract  retain and provide support to a network of independent third party brokers  consultants and agents 
our products are sold in part through independent brokers  consultants and agents who assist in the production and servicing of business 
we typically do not have long term contracts with our independent brokers  consultants and agents  who generally are not exclusive to us and who typically also recommend and or market health care products and services of our competitors 
as a result  we must compete intensely for their services and allegiance 
our sales would be adversely affected if we are unable to attract or retain independent brokers  consultants and agents or if we do not adequately provide support  training and education to them regarding our product portfolio  or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels 
because broker and agent commissions are included as health insurer administrative expenses under the medical loss ratio requirements of the health reform legislation  these expenses will be under the same cost reduction pressures as other health insurer administrative costs 
our relationships with brokers and agents could be adversely impacted by changes in our businesses practices to address these pressures  including potential reductions in commissions and changes in the treatment of consulting fees 
in addition  there have been a number of investigations regarding the marketing practices of brokers and agents selling health care products and the payments they receive 
these have resulted in enforcement actions against companies in our industry and brokers and agents marketing and selling these companies products 
for example  cms and state departments of insurance have increased their scrutiny of the marketing practices of brokers and agents who market medicare products 
these investigations and enforcement actions could result in penalties and the imposition of corrective action plans and or changes to industry practice  which could adversely impact our ability to market our products 
our relationship with aarp is important and the loss of such relationship could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
under our agreements with aarp  we provide aarp branded medicare supplement insurance  hospital indemnity insurance and other products to aarp members and medicare part d prescription drug plans to aarp members and non members 
one of our agreements with aarp expands the relationship to include aarp branded medicare advantage plans for aarp members and non members 
our agreements with aarp contain commitments regarding corporate governance  corporate social responsibility  diversity and measures intended to improve and simplify the health care experience for consumers 
the aarp agreements may be terminated early under certain circumstances  including  depending on the agreement  a material breach by either party  insolvency of either party  a material adverse change in our financial condition  material changes in the medicare programs  material harm to aarp caused by us  and by mutual agreement 
the success of our aarp arrangements depends  in part  on our ability to service aarp and its members  develop additional products and services  price the products and services competitively  meet our corporate governance  corporate social responsibility  and diversity commitments  and respond effectively to federal and state regulatory changes 
the loss of our aarp relationship could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

table of contents because of the nature of our business  we are routinely subject to various litigation actions  which  if resolved unfavorably  could result in substantial penalties and or monetary damages and adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
periodically  we become a party to the types of legal actions that can affect any business  such as employment and employment discrimination related suits  employee benefit claims  breach of contract actions  medical malpractice  shareholder suits  and intellectual property related litigation 
in addition  because of the nature of our business  we are routinely made party to a variety of legal actions related to the design and management of our service offerings 
these matters include  among others  claims related to health care benefits coverage and payment including disputes with enrollees  customers  and contracted and non contracted physicians  hospitals and other health care professionals  tort  contract disputes and claims related to disclosure of certain business practices 
we are also party to certain class action lawsuits brought by health care professional groups 
we are largely self insured with regard to litigation risks 
although we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers for claims in excess of our self insurance  certain types of damages  such as punitive damages in some circumstances  are not covered by insurance 
we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from self insured matters  however  it is possible that the level of actual losses will exceed the liabilities recorded 
a description of significant legal actions in which we are currently involved is included in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we cannot predict the outcome of these actions with certainty  and we are incurring expenses in resolving these matters 
therefore  these legal actions could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our investment portfolio may suffer losses  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
market fluctuations could impair our profitability and capital position 
volatility in interest rates affects our interest income and the market value of our investments in debt securities of varying maturities  which comprise the vast majority of the fair value of our investments as of december  relatively low interest rates on investments  such as those experienced during recent years  have negatively impacted our investment income  and a prolonged low interest rate environment could further adversely affect our investment income 
in addition  defaults by issuers  primarily from investments in liquid corporate and municipal bonds  who fail to pay or perform on their obligations  could reduce our net investment income as we may be required to write down the value of our investments  which would adversely affect our profitability and shareholders equity 
we also allocate a small proportion of our portfolio to equity investments  which are subject to greater volatility than fixed income investments 
general economic conditions  stock market conditions  and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our equity investments and may result in investment losses 
there can be no assurance that our investments will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than their carrying values 
changes in the value of our investment assets  as a result of interest rate fluctuations  illiquidity or otherwise  could have a negative effect on our shareholders equity 
in addition  if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis  it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and the capital position of regulated subsidiaries 
if the value of our intangible assets is materially impaired  our results of operations  shareholders equity and debt ratings could be materially adversely affected 
goodwill and other intangible assets were billion as of december   representing of our total assets 
we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired  in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary 
for example  the 
table of contents manner in or the extent to which the health reform legislation is implemented may impact our ability to maintain the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets in our business 
in addition  from time to time we divest businesses as part of our business strategy  and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges  including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs 
a material decrease in shareholders equity could  in turn  negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants 
large scale medical emergencies may result in significant medical costs and may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
large scale medical emergencies can take many forms and can cause widespread illness and death 
such emergencies could materially and adversely affect the us economy in general and the health care industry specifically 
for example  in the event of a natural disaster  bioterrorism attack  pandemic or other extreme events  we could face  among other things  significant medical costs and increased use of health care services 
any such disaster or similar event could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we fail to properly maintain the integrity or availability of our data or to strategically implement new or upgrade or consolidate existing information systems  or if our technology products do not operate as intended  our business could be materially adversely affected 
our ability to adequately price our products and services  to provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion  and to accurately report our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems 
as a result of technology initiatives and recently enacted regulations  changes in our system platforms and integration of new business acquisitions  we have been consolidating and integrating the number of systems we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information systems capabilities 
our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain  protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology  evolving systems and regulatory standards  and changing customer patterns 
if the information we rely upon to run our businesses was found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively  we could lose existing customers  have difficulty attracting new customers  have problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing  have difficulty preventing  detecting and controlling fraud  have disputes with customers  physicians and other health care professionals  have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed  have increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences 
there can be no assurance that our process of consolidating the number of systems we operate  upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities  protecting and enhancing our systems and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future 
failure to consolidate and integrate our systems successfully could result in higher than expected costs and diversion of management s time and energy  which could materially impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  certain of our businesses sell and install hardware and software products  and these products may contain unexpected design defects or may encounter unexpected complications during installation or when used with other technologies utilized by the customer 
connectivity among competing technologies is becoming increasingly important in the health care industry 
a failure of our technology products to operate as intended and in a seamless fashion with other products could adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations 

table of contents if we are not able to protect our proprietary rights to our databases and related products  our ability to market our knowledge and information related businesses could be hindered and our business could be adversely affected 
we rely on our agreements with customers  confidentiality agreements with employees  and our trademarks  trade secrets  copyrights and patents to protect our proprietary rights 
these legal protections and precautions may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information 
in addition  substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the software industry  and we expect software products to be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in this industry segment grows 
such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell products and services and our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our ability to obtain funds from some of our subsidiaries is restricted and if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations  our operations or financial position may be adversely affected 
because we operate as a holding company  we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from some of our subsidiaries to fund our obligations 
many of these subsidiaries are regulated by states departments of insurance 
we are also required by law or regulation to maintain specific prescribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries 
the levels of capitalization required depend primarily upon the volume of premium revenues generated 
a significant increase in premium volume will require additional capitalization from us 
in most states  we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts 
in addition  we normally notify the state departments of insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval 
an inability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to their parent companies could impact the scale to which we could reinvest in our business through capital expenditures or business acquisitions  and could adversely affect our ability to maintain our corporate quarterly dividend payment cycle  repurchase of shares of our common stock and repay our debt 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations  our operations or financial position may be adversely affected 
any failure by us to manage and complete acquisitions and other significant transactions successfully could harm our results of operations  business and prospects 
as part of our business strategy  we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding possible investments  acquisitions  divestitures  strategic alliances  joint ventures  and outsourcing transactions and often enter into agreements relating to such transactions 
if we fail to identify and complete successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives  we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally  we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions  any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
for acquisitions  success is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into our existing operations 
if we are unable to successfully integrate and grow these acquisitions and to realize contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
downgrades in our credit ratings  should they occur  may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
claims paying ability  financial strength  and credit ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies 
ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry 
we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers 
our credit ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings 
each of the credit rating agencies reviews its ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current credit ratings will be maintained in the 
table of contents future 
our ratings reflect each credit rating agency s opinion of our financial strength  operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders 
downgrades in our credit ratings  should they occur  may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations

executive overview general unitedhealth group is a diversified health and well being company  whose focus is on improving the overall health and well being of the people we serve and their communities and enhancing the performance of the health system 
we work with health care professionals and other key partners to expand access to high quality health care 
we help people get the care they need at an affordable cost  support the physician patient relationship  and empower people with the information  guidance and tools they need to make personal health choices and decisions 
through our diversified family of businesses  we leverage core competencies in advanced technology based transactional capabilities  health care data  knowledge and information  and health care resource organization and care facilitation to help make health care work better 
these core competencies are focused in two market areas  health benefits and health services 
health benefits are offered in the individual and employer markets and the public and senior markets through our unitedhealthcare employer individual  unitedhealthcare medicare retirement  and unitedhealthcare community state businesses 
health services are provided to the participants in the health system itself  ranging from employers and health plans to physicians and life sciences companies through our optumhealth  ingenix and prescription solutions businesses 
in aggregate  these businesses have more than two dozen distinct business units that address specific end markets 
each of these business units focuses on the key goals in health and well being access  affordability  quality and simplicity as they apply to their specific market 
revenues our revenues are primarily comprised of premiums derived from risk based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is typically at a fixed rate per individual served for a one year period  and we assume the economic risk of funding our customers health care benefits and related administrative costs 
we also generate revenues from fee based services performed for customers that self insure the health care costs of their employees and employees dependants 
for both risk based and fee based health care benefit arrangements  we provide coordination and facilitation of medical services  transaction processing  health care professional services  and access to contracted networks of physicians  hospitals and other health care professionals 
we also generate service revenues from ingenix health intelligence and consulting businesses 
product revenues are mainly comprised of products sold by our prescription solutions pharmacy benefit management business and sales of ingenix publishing and software products 
we derive investment income primarily from interest earned on our investments in debt securities 
our investment income also includes gains or losses when the securities are sold  or other than temporarily impaired 
operating costs medical costs 
our operating results depend in large part on our ability to effectively estimate  price for and manage our medical costs through underwriting criteria  product design  negotiation of favorable care provider 
table of contents contracts and care coordination programs 
controlling medical costs requires a comprehensive and integrated approach to organize and advance the full range of interrelationships among patients consumers  health professionals  hospitals  pharmaceutical technology manufacturers and other key stakeholders 
medical costs include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of insured consumers for which we neither have received nor processed claims  and our estimates for physician  hospital and other medical cost disputes 
in every reporting period  our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods 
our medical care ratio  calculated as medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues  reflects the combination of pricing  benefit designs  consumer health care utilization and comprehensive care facilitation efforts 
we seek to sustain a stable medical care ratio for an equivalent mix of business 
however  changes in business mix  such as expanding participation in comparatively higher medical care ratio government sponsored public sector programs and recently enacted health reform legislation may impact our premiums  medical costs and medical care ratio 
in  we expect consumer usage of the health system to increase  resuming its upward growth pattern from the recent moderation in utilization growth 
we will work to manage medical cost trends through affordable network relationships  pay for performance reimbursement programs for care providers  and targeted clinical initiatives around improving quality and affordability 
however  an increase in utilization will likely result in increased medical costs and an increase in our medical care ratio 
operating costs 
operating costs are primarily comprised of costs related to employee compensation and benefits  agent and broker commissions  premium taxes and assessments  professional fees  advertising and occupancy costs 
we seek to improve our operating cost ratio  calculated as operating costs as a percentage of total revenues  for an equivalent mix of business 
however  changes in business mix  such as increases in the size of our health services businesses may impact our operating costs and operating cost ratio 
cash flows we generate cash primarily from premiums  service and product revenues and investment income  as well as proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investments 
our primary uses of cash are for payments of medical claims and operating costs  payments on debt  purchases of investments  acquisitions  dividends to shareholders and common stock repurchases 
for more information on our cash flows  see liquidity below 
business realignment on january   we realigned certain of our businesses to respond to changes in the markets we serve and the opportunities that are emerging as the health system evolves 
for example  in optumhealth s results of operations will include our clinical services assets  including southwest medical multi specialty clinics in nevada and our evercare nurse practitioners serving the frail and elderly  which had historically been reported in unitedhealthcare employer individual and unitedhealthcare medicare retirement  respectively 
unitedhealthcare employer individual s results of operations will include optumhealth specialty benefits  including dental  vision  life and disability 
there were no changes to our reportable segments as a result of these changes 
our periodic filings beginning with our first quarter form q will include historical segment results restated to reflect the effect of this realignment 
business trends our businesses participate in the us health economy  which comprises approximately of us gross domestic product and which has grown consistently for many years 
we expect overall spending on health care in 
table of contents the us to continue to rise in the future  due to inflation  medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement  regulatory requirements  demographic trends in the us population and national interest in health and well being 
the rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors  including macro economic conditions and enacted health care reforms  which could also impact our results of operations 
health care reforms 
in the first quarter of  the health reform legislation was signed into law 
the health reform legislation expands access to coverage and modifies aspects of the commercial insurance market  the medicaid and medicare programs  chip and other aspects of the health care system 
hhs  the dol and the treasury department have issued regulations or proposed regulations on a number of aspects of health reform legislation  but we await final rules and interim guidance on other key aspects of the legislation  all of which have a variety of effective dates 
we operate a diversified set of businesses that focus on health care  and our business model has been intentionally designed to address a multitude of market sectors 
the health reform legislation and the related federal and state regulations will impact how we do business and could restrict growth in certain products and market segments  restrict premium rate increases for certain products and market segments  increase our medical and administrative costs or expose us to an increased risk of liability  any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on us 
we also anticipate that the health reform legislation will further increase attention on the need for health care cost containment and improvements in quality  as well as in prevention  wellness and disease management 
we believe demand for many of our service offerings  such as consulting services  data management  information technology and related infrastructure construction  disease management  and population based health and wellness programs will continue to grow 
beginning in  health plans with medical loss ratios on fully insured products  as calculated under the definitions in the health reform legislation and regulations  that fall below certain targets for large employer groups  for small employer groups and for individuals will be required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums to their customers annually 
rebate payments  if any  for would be made in mid the potential for and size of the rebates will be measured at the market level  by state and by licensed subsidiary 
this disaggregation of insurance pools into much smaller pools will likely decrease the predictability of results for any given pool and could lead to variation over time in estimates of rebates owed in total 
in the aggregate  the rebate regulations cap the level of margin that can be attained 
depending on the results of the calculation  there is a broad range of potential rebate and other business impacts and there could be meaningful disruption in local health care markets if companies decide to adjust their offerings in response to these requirements 
for example  companies could elect to change pricing  modify product features or benefits  adjust their mix of business or even exit segments of the market 
companies could also seek to adjust their operating costs to support reduced premiums by making changes to their distribution arrangements or decreasing spending on non medical product features and services 
companies continue to face a significant amount of uncertainty given the breadth of possible changes  including changes in the competitive environment  state rate approval  fluctuations in medical costs  the statistical variation that results from assessing business by state  by license and by market and the potential for meaningful market disruption in and we have made changes to reduce our product distribution costs in the individual market in response to this legislation  including reducing broker commissions  and are evaluating changes to distribution in the large group insured market segment 
these changes could impact future growth in these products 
other market participants could also implement changes to their business practices in response to this legislation  which could positively or negatively impact our growth and market share 
the health reform legislation also requires hhs to maintain an annual review of unreasonable increases in premium rates for commercial health plans 
hhs recently proposed a regulation that defines a review threshold of annual premium rate increases generally at or above  and the proposed rule clarifies that the hhs review will not supersede existing state review and approval processes 
the proposed regulation further requires health plans to provide to the states and hhs extensive information supporting any rate increase of or more 
the 
table of contents federal government is encouraging states to intensify their reviews of requests for rate increases and providing funding to assist in those state level reviews 
ultimately  rate approval responsibility still lies with the states under the proposed regulation 
depending on the level of anticipated increased scrutiny by the states  there is a broad range of potential business impacts 
for example  it may become more difficult to price our commercial risk business consistent with expected underlying cost trends  leading to the risk of operating margin compression 
effective in  the health reform legislation mandates consumer discounts of on brand name prescription drugs and on generic prescription drugs for part d plan participants in the coverage gap 
this statutory reduction in drug prices for seniors in the coverage gap may cause people who may have had difficulty affording their medications to increase their pharmaceutical usage 
the change in pricing could also have secondary effects  such as changing the mix of brand name and generic drug usage by seniors 
we have incorporated the anticipated impact of these changes in our product pricing and pharmacy benefit management business plan 
as part of the health reform legislation  medicare advantage payment rates for were frozen at levels 
separately  cms implemented a reduction in medicare advantage reimbursements of for we expect the rates will be outpaced by underlying medical trends  placing continued importance on effective medical management and ongoing improvements in administrative costs 
beginning in  additional cuts to medicare advantage plans will take effect plans will ultimately receive of medicare fee for service rates in high cost areas to in low cost areas  with changes being phased in over two to six years  depending on the level of payment reduction in a county 
all of these changes could result in reduced enrollment or reimbursement or payment levels 
there are a number of annual adjustments we can make to our operations  which may partially offset any impact from these rate reductions 
for example  we can adjust members benefits  decide on a county by county basis which geographies to participate in and seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management 
additionally  achieving high quality scores from cms for improving upon certain clinical and operational performance standards will impact future quality bonuses 
quality bonus payments may further offset these anticipated rate reductions as cms quality rating bonus payments are phased in over three years beginning in we also may be able to mitigate the effects of reduced funding on margins by increasing enrollment due to the anticipated increase in the number of people eligible for medicare in coming years 
longer term  market wide decreases in the availability or relative quality of medicare advantage products may increase demand for other senior health benefits products such as our medicare part d and medicare supplement insurance offerings 
the health reform legislation presents additional opportunities and challenges over the longer term  including the assessment of an annual billion insurance industry assessment beginning in  the operation of state based exchanges for individuals and small businesses beginning in  and numerous other commercial and governmental plan requirements 
individual states may also accelerate their procurement of medicaid managed care services for sizeable groups of medicaid program beneficiaries in order to even their administrative workloads when medicaid market expansions take place in the law could increase near term business growth opportunities for unitedhealthcare community state 
due to the complexity of the health care system and the numerous changes that are taking place  the longer term effect of the new legislation remains difficult to assess 
court proceedings related to the health reform legislation  such as the ruling by the united states district court for the northern district of florida in a case brought on behalf of state attorneys general and or governors that declared the entire legislation unconstitutional  and the potential for congressional action to impede implementation  create additional uncertainties with respect to the law 
for additional information regarding the health reform legislation and the related risk factors  see item  business government regulation and item a  risk factors 
adverse economic conditions 
the current us economic environment has impacted demand for some of our products and services 
for example  decreases in employment have reduced the number of workers and dependants offered health care benefits by our customers  and have put pressure on our overall growth and 
table of contents operating profitability 
if the current economic environment continues for a prolonged period  federal and state governments may decrease funding for various health care government programs in which we participate and or impose new or higher levels of taxes or assessments 
government funding pressure  coupled with adverse economic conditions  will impact the financial positions of hospitals  physicians and other care providers and could therefore increase medical cost trends experienced by our businesses 
our revenues are also impacted by us monetary and fiscal policy 
in response to current economic conditions  the us federal reserve has maintained the target federal funds rate at a range of zero to basis points

the favorable development in was primarily driven by lower than expected health system utilization levels  more efficient claims handling and processing  which results in higher completion factors  a reduction in reserves needed for disputed claims from care providers  and favorable resolution of certain state based assessments 
the medical care ratio decreased due to a moderation in overall demand for medical services  successful clinical engagement and management and the increase in prior period favorable development discussed previously 
operating costs operating costs for increased due to acquired and organic growth in health services businesses  which are generally more operating cost intensive than our benefits businesses  goodwill impairment and charges for a business line disposition at ingenix  which is discussed in more detail below  an increase in staffing and selling expenses primarily due to the change in the medicare advantage annual enrollment period  costs related to increased employee headcount and compensation  increased advertising costs  and the absorption of new business development and start up costs 
income tax rate the increase in our effective income tax rate for as compared to resulted from a benefit in the tax rate from the resolution of various historical state income tax matters and an increase in the rate related to limitations on the future deductibility of certain compensation related to the health reform legislation

liquidity  financial condition and capital resources liquidity introduction we manage our liquidity and financial position in the context of our overall business strategy 
we continually forecast and manage our cash  investments  working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short and long term obligations of our businesses while maintaining liquidity and financial flexibility 
cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before non cash expenses 
the risk of decreased operating cash flow from a decline in earnings is partially mitigated by the diversity of our businesses  geographies and customers  our disciplined underwriting and pricing processes for our risk based businesses  and continued productivity improvements in our operating costs 
our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations 
a majority of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash  cash equivalents and investments 
after considering expected cash flows from operating activities  we generally invest cash of regulated subsidiaries that exceeds our expected short term obligations in longer term  liquid  investment grade  debt securities to improve our overall investment return 
we make these investments pursuant to our board of directors approved investment policy  which focuses on preservation of capital  credit quality  diversification  income and duration 
the policy also generally governs return objectives  regulatory limitations  tax implications and risk tolerances 
our regulated subsidiaries are subject to regulations and standards in their respective states of domicile 
most of these regulations and standards conform to those established by the naic 
these standards  among other things  require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their parent companies 
except in 
table of contents the case of extraordinary dividends  these standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiary s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus 
these dividends are referred to as ordinary dividends and generally can be paid without prior regulatory approval 
if the dividend  together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months  exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus  the entire dividend is generally considered an extraordinary dividend and must receive prior regulatory approval 
in  based on the statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus levels  the maximum amount of ordinary dividends which could be paid was billion 
for the year ended december   our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of billion  including million of extraordinary dividends 
for the year ended december   our regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of billion  including billion of extraordinary dividends 
the total dividends received in both and included all of the ordinary dividend capacity of billion and billion  respectively 
in some cases  ordinary dividends were classified as extraordinary dividends due to their increased size and or accelerated timing 
our non regulated businesses also generate cash flows from operations for general corporate use 
cash flows generated by these entities  combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of commercial paper and long term debt  as well as the availability of our committed credit facility  further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility 
we generally use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions  reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures  repay debt  or return capital to our shareholders through shareholder dividends and or repurchases of our common stock  depending on market conditions 
results a summary of our major sources and uses of cash is reflected in the table below year ended december  in millions sources of cash cash provided by operating activities sales of investments maturities of investments proceeds from customer funds administered proceeds from issuance of commercial paper  net proceeds from issuance of long term debt interest rate swap termination other total sources of cash uses of cash purchases of investments cash paid for acquisitions  net of cash assumed and disposition retirement of long term debt common stock repurchases purchases of property  equipment and capitalized software dividends paid repayments of commercial paper  net other total uses of cash net decrease increase in cash 
table of contents cash flows compared to cash flows cash flows from operating activities increased million  or  for factors that increased cash flows from operating activities were growth in net earnings  an acceleration of certain premium payments  and an increase in pharmacy rebate collections which were partially offset by a mandated acceleration in the claim payment cycle associated with the medicare part d program and payment for the settlement of the american medical association class action litigation related to reimbursement for out of network medical services 
we anticipate lower cash flows from operations in as compared to as a result of an anticipated decrease in net earnings and the early receipt of certain premium payments in late cash flows used for investing activities increased billion  primarily due to acquisitions completed in  decreases in sales of investments due to a more stable market environment and uses of operating cash to purchase investments 
cash flows used for financing activities decreased million  or  primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and long term debt partially offset by increases in common stock repurchases and cash dividends paid on our common stock 
cash flows compared to cash flows cash flows from operating activities increased billion  or  primarily due to the payment in of million  net of taxes  for the settlement of two class action lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices  the increase in medical costs payable driven by membership growth in risk based products in the public and senior markets businesses  and the effect of changes to our receivable and payable balances with cms related to medicare part d 
additionally  we paid less taxes in due to tax law changes that took effect in operating cash flows in included payment of taxes due under the prior tax law  while the payment did not include prior year amounts 
cash flows used for investing activities decreased billion  or  primarily due to acquisitions completed in and decreases in the usage of cash in for purchases of investments  which more than offset the decreases in sales and maturities of investments 
cash flows used for financing activities increased billion due to the issuance of long term debt in and the effect of our change in intent with respect to offsetting cash balances in excess of bank deposits in these items were partially offset by decreases in common stock repurchases in and the proceeds from our terminated interest rate swap contracts 
financial condition as of december   our cash  cash equivalent and available for sale investment balances of billion included billion of cash and cash equivalents of which million was held by non regulated entities  billion of debt securities and million of investments in equity securities and venture capital funds 
given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents  we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity 
the use of different market assumptions or valuation methodologies  primarily used in valuing our level equity securities  may have an effect on the estimated fair value amounts of our investments 
due to the subjective nature of these assumptions  the estimates may not be indicative of the actual exit price if we had sold the investment at the measurement date 
other sources of liquidity  primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program  which is supported by our billion bank credit facility  reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail of our fair value measurements 
our cash equivalent and investment portfolio has a weighted average duration of years and a weighted average credit rating of aa as of december  included in the debt securities balance are billion of 
table of contents state and municipal obligations that are guaranteed by a number of third parties 
we do not have any significant exposure to any single guarantor neither indirect through the guarantees  nor direct through investment in the guarantor 
further  due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers  the weighted average credit rating of these securities both with and without the guarantee is aa as of december  capital resources and uses of liquidity in addition to cash flow from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use  our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows commercial paper 
we maintain a commercial paper program  which facilitates the issuance of senior unsecured debt through third party broker dealers 
the commercial paper program is supported by the billion bank credit facility described below 
we had million of commercial paper outstanding as of december  our issuance of commercial paper in was to maintain ample liquidity at the holding company level 
bank credit facility 
we have a billion five year revolving bank credit facility with banks  which matures in may this facility supports our commercial paper program and is available for general corporate purposes 
we had no amounts outstanding under this facility as of december  the interest rate is variable based on term and amount and is calculated based on libor plus a spread 
as of december   the annual interest rate on this facility  had it been drawn  would have ranged from to 
our bank credit facility contains various covenants  including requiring us to maintain a debt to total capital ratio below 
our debt to total capital ratio  calculated as debt divided by the sum of debt and shareholders equity  was and as of december  and  respectively 
we were in compliance with our debt covenants as of december  debt issuance 
in october  we issued million in senior unsecured notes under our february s shelf registration statement 
the issuance included million of fixed rate notes due october and million of fixed rate notes due october we intend to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes

our credit ratings at december  were as follows moody s standard poor s fitch a am best ratings outlook ratings outlook ratings outlook ratings outlook senior unsecured debt baa stable a stable a negative bbb stable commercial paper p n a a n a f n a amb n a a on january   fitch updated their ratings outlook on our senior unsecured debt to stable 
the availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors  including our profitability  operating cash flows  debt levels  credit ratings  debt covenants and other contractual restrictions  regulatory requirements and economic and market conditions 
for example  a significant downgrade in our credit ratings or conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital 
we have therefore adopted strategies and actions to maintain financial flexibility and mitigate the impact of such factors on our ability to raise capital 
share repurchases 
under our board of directors authorization  we maintain a common share repurchase program 
repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market  subject to certain preset parameters 
in february  the board renewed and increased our share repurchase program  and authorized us to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock 
in  we repurchased million shares at an average price of approximately per share and an aggregate cost of billion 
as of december   we had board authorization to purchase up to an additional million shares of our common stock 

table of contents debt tender 
in february  we completed cash tender offers for million aggregate principal amount of certain of our outstanding notes 
we believe this debt repurchase will improve the matching of floating rate assets and liabilities on our balance sheet and reduce our debt service cost 
we used cash on hand to fund the purchase of the notes 
dividends 
in may  our board of directors increased our cash dividend to shareholders and moved us to a quarterly dividend payment cycle

under our reinsurance arrangement with oneamerica financial partners  inc oneamerica these amounts are payable by oneamerica  but we remain liable to the policyholders if they are unable to pay 
we have recorded a corresponding reinsurance receivable from oneamerica in our consolidated financial statements

table of contents e includes obligations associated with contingent consideration and other payments related to business acquisitions  certain employee benefit programs  charitable contributions related to the pacificare acquisition  interest rate swaps and various other long term liabilities 
due to uncertainty regarding payment timing  obligations for employee benefit programs  charitable contributions and other liabilities have been classified as thereafter 
f includes remaining capital commitments for venture capital funds and other funding commitments 
we do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments that require cash resources  however  we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations 
this includes internal development of new products  programs and technology applications  and may include acquisitions 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we were not involved in any off balance sheet arrangements as that phrase is defined by sec rules applicable to this report which have or are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
recently issued accounting standards we have determined that there have been no recently issued accounting standards that will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  or apply to our operations 
critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require management to make challenging  subjective or complex judgments  often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
medical costs each reporting period  we estimate our obligations for medical care services that have been rendered on behalf of insured consumers but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed and for liabilities for physician  hospital and other medical cost disputes 
we develop estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported using an actuarial process that is consistently applied  centrally controlled and automated 
the actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt  claim backlogs  seasonal variances in medical care consumption  health care professional contract rate changes  medical care utilization and other medical cost trends  membership volume and demographics  benefit plan changes  and business mix changes related to products  customers and geography 
depending on the health care professional and type of service  the typical billing lag for services can be up to days from the date of service 
substantially all claims related to medical care services are known and settled within nine to twelve months from the date of service 
we estimate liabilities for physician  hospital and other medical cost disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement actions 
each period  we re examine previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances 
as more complete claim information becomes available  we adjust the amount of the estimates and include the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified 
in every reporting period  our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods 
if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate  we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period favorable development 
if the revised estimate of prior period medical costs 
table of contents is more than the previous estimate  we will increase reported medical costs in the current period unfavorable development 
medical costs in  and  included net favorable medical cost development related to prior periods of million  million and million  respectively 
in developing our medical costs payable estimates  we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated 
for example  we actuarially calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent month period 
a completion factor is an actuarial estimate  based upon historical experience  of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated by us at the date of estimation 
for months prior to the most recent three months  we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated to date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months 
for the most recent three months  we estimate claim costs incurred primarily by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month pmpm medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available  supplemented by a review of near term completion factors 
medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months and by reviewing a broad set of health care utilization indicators including  but not limited to  pharmacy utilization trends  inpatient hospital census data and incidence data from the national centers for disease control 
this approach is consistently applied from period to period 
completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for older periods  generally periods prior to the most recent three months 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of december  completion factors increase decrease in factors increase decrease in medical costs payable in millions medical cost pmpm trend factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent three months as of december  medical cost pmpm trend increase decrease in factors increase decrease in medical costs payable in millions the analyses above include outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims 
our estimate of medical costs payable represents management s best estimate of our liability for unpaid medical costs as of december   developed using consistently applied actuarial methods 
management believes 
table of contents the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of december   however  actual claim payments may differ from established estimates 
assuming a hypothetical difference between our december  estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable  excluding aarp medicare supplement insurance  net earnings would increase or decrease by million and diluted net earnings per common share would increase or decrease by per share 
the current national health care cost inflation rate significantly exceeds the general inflation rate 
we use various strategies to lessen the effects of health care cost inflation 
these include coordinating care with physicians and other health care professionals and rate discounts from physicians and other health care professionals 
through contracts with physicians and other health care professionals  we emphasize preventive health care  appropriate use of health care services consistent with clinical performance standards  education and closing gaps in care 
we believe our strategies to mitigate the impact of health care cost inflation on our operating results have been and will continue to be successful 
however  other factors including competitive pressures  new health care and pharmaceutical product introductions  demands from physicians and other health care professionals and consumers  major epidemics  and applicable regulations may affect our ability to control the impact of health care cost inflation 
because of the narrow operating margins of our risk based products  changes in medical cost trends that were not anticipated in establishing premium rates can create significant changes in our financial results 
revenues revenues are principally derived from health care insurance premiums 
we recognize premium revenues in the period eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services 
customers are typically billed monthly at a contracted rate per eligible person multiplied by the total number of people eligible to receive services  as recorded in our records 
employer groups generally provide us with changes to their eligible population one month in arrears 
each billing includes an adjustment for prior period changes in eligibility status that were not reflected in our previous billing 
we estimate and adjust the current period s revenues and accounts receivable accordingly 
our estimates are based on historical trends  premiums billed  the level of contract renewal activity and other relevant information 
beginning in  premium revenue subject to the medical loss ratio rebates of the health reform legislation will be recognized based on the estimated premium earned net of the projected rebates over the period of the contract  if that amount can be reasonably estimated 
the estimated premium will be revised each period to reflect current experience 
we revise estimates of revenue adjustments each period and record changes in the period they become known 
cms deploys a risk adjustment model  which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors 
the cms risk adjustment model pays more for members whose medical history indicates they have certain medical conditions 
under this risk adjustment methodology  cms calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient  hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings 
we and other health care providers collect  capture  and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to cms within prescribed deadlines 
we estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms 
risk adjustment data for certain of our plans is subject to audit by regulators 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for additional information regarding these audits 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill 
goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses 
goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to an annual impairment test 
tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
to determine whether 
table of contents goodwill is impaired  we perform a two step impairment test 
in the first step of the test  the fair values of the reporting units are compared to their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we would proceed to step two of the test 
in step two of the test  the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is determined by a hypothetical allocation of the fair value calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit including any recognized and unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was reflective of the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess  if any  of the calculated fair value after hypothetical allocation to the reporting unit s assets and liabilities 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is greater than the carrying amount of the goodwill at the analysis date  goodwill is not impaired and the analysis is complete 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill at the analysis date  goodwill is deemed impaired by the amount of that variance 
we calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units using discounted cash flows 
to determine fair values we must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors 
significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow including significant assumptions about operations  capital requirements and income taxes  long term growth rates for determining terminal value  and discount rates 
where available and appropriate  comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test 
we completed our annual assessment of goodwill as of january   which considered our business realignment  and determined that other than the million impairment related to certain of ingenix s businesses  no goodwill impairment existed as of december  although we believe that the financial projections used are reasonable and appropriate for all of our reporting units  there is uncertainty inherent in those projections 
that uncertainty is increased by the impact of health care reforms as discussed in item  business government regulation 
for additional discussions regarding how the enactment or implementation of health care reforms could affect our business  see item a  risk factors in part i 
intangible assets 
finite lived intangible assets are acquired in a business combination and are assets that represent future expected benefits but lack physical substance eg  membership lists  customer contracts and trademarks 
we do not have material holdings of indefinite lived intangible assets 
intangible assets are amortized over their expected useful lives and are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that a finite lived intangible asset s or asset group s carrying value may exceed its estimated fair value 
if the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value  an impairment would be recorded 
we calculate the estimated fair value of finite lived intangible assets using undiscounted cash flows that are expected to result from the use of the intangible asset or group of assets 
we consider many factors  including estimated future utility to estimate cash flows 
there were no material impairments of finite lived intangible assets during the current year 
investments as of december   we had investments with a carrying value of billion  primarily held in marketable debt securities 
our investments are principally classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value 
we exclude gross unrealized gains and losses on available for sale investments from earnings and report net unrealized gains or losses  net of income tax effects  as a separate component in shareholders equity 
we continually monitor the difference between the cost and fair value of our investments 
as of december   our investments had gross unrealized gains of million and gross unrealized losses of million 
we evaluate investments for impairment considering the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer as well as specific events or circumstances that may influence the operations of the issuer and our intent to sell the security or the likelihood that we will be required to sell the 
table of contents security before recovery of the entire amortized cost 
for debt securities  if we intend to either sell or determine that we will be more likely than not be required to sell a debt security before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis or maturity of the debt security  we recognize the entire impairment in earnings 
if we do not intend to sell the debt security and we determine that we will not be more likely than not be required to sell the debt security but we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis  the impairment is bifurcated into the amount attributed to the credit loss  which is recognized in earnings  and all other causes  which are recognized in other comprehensive income 
for equity securities  we recognize impairments in other comprehensive income if we expect to hold the equity security until fair value increases to at least the equity security s cost basis and we expect that increase in fair value to occur in a reasonably forecasted period 
if we intend to sell the equity security or if we believe that recovery of fair value to cost will not occur in the near term  we recognize the impairment in net earnings 
new information and the passage of time can change these judgments 
we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer or market sector  and largely limit our investments to us government and agency securities  state and municipal securities  mortgage backed securities  and corporate debt obligations  substantially all of investment grade quality 
securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with the investment policy 
income taxes our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and uncertain tax positions reflect our assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities  as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 
we have established a net valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain 
after application of the valuation allowances  we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred income tax assets 
we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax contingency reserves are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
according to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
we have established an estimated liability for federal  state and non us income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual under us gaap 
we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 
in the normal course of business  our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities 
inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation  regulation and or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 
the significant assumptions and estimates described above are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate in each year 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by on our earnings before income taxes would have caused the provision for income taxes to change by million 
contingent liabilities because of the nature of our businesses  we are routinely involved in various disputes  legal proceedings and governmental audits and investigations 
we record liabilities for our estimates of the probable costs resulting from these matters 
our estimates are developed in consultation with outside legal counsel  if appropriate  and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and considering our insurance coverage  if any  for such matters 
it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our estimates or assumptions 

table of contents legal matters a description of our legal proceedings is included in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements and is incorporated by reference in this report 
concentrations of credit risk investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk 
our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our board of directors 
this policy limits the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to us government and agency securities  state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations that are investment grade 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base 
as of december   we had an aggregate billion reinsurance receivable resulting from the sale of our golden rule financial corporation life and annuity business in we regularly evaluate the financial condition of the reinsurer and only record the reinsurance receivable to the extent that the amounts are deemed probable of recovery 
currently  the reinsurer is rated by am best as a 
as of december   there were no other significant concentrations of credit risk 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risks are exposures to a changes in interest rates that impact our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed rate financial investments and debt and b changes in equity prices that impact the value of our equity investments 
as of december   billion of our financial investments was classified as cash and cash equivalents on which interest rates received vary with market interest rates  which may materially impact our investment income 
also  billion of our debt as of december  was at interest rates that vary with market rates  either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts 
the fair value of certain of our fixed rate financial investments and debt also varies with market interest rates 
as of december   billion of our investments was fixed rate debt securities and billion of our debt was fixed rate term debt 
an increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed rate investments and fixed rate debt 
conversely  a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fixed rate investments and fixed rate debt 
we manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed income market sectors and debt across maturities and interest rate indices  as well as endeavoring to match our floating rate assets and liabilities over time  either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts 
as part of our risk management strategy  we enter into interest rate swap agreements with creditworthy financial institutions to manage the impact of market interest rates on interest expense 
our swap agreements converted a portion of our interest expense from fixed to variable rates to better match the impact of changes in market rates on our variable rate cash equivalent investments 
additional information on our derivative financial instruments is included in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the following table summarizes the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by or as of december  on our investment income and interest expense per annum  and the fair value of our financial investments and debt in millions increase decrease in market interest rate investment income per annum a interest expense per annum a fair value of financial investments fair value of debt nm nm   nm not meaningful a given the low absolute level of short term market rates on our floating rate assets and liabilities as of december   the assumed hypothetical change in interest rates does not reflect the full point reduction in interest income or interest expense as the rate cannot fall below zero 
as of december   we had million of investments in equity securities and venture capital funds  a portion of which were invested in various public and non public companies concentrated in the areas of health care delivery and related information technologies 
market conditions that affect the value of health care or technology stocks will likewise impact the value of our equity investments
