item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
residential mortgage lending the company originates and purchases first mortgage loans secured by one to four family properties 
at december   the company s portfolio of these types of loans was million 
table of contents or of its gross loans receivable 
most of these loans are owner occupied  however  the company also originates first mortgage loans secured by second homes  seasonal homes  and investment properties 
the company originates primarily conventional fixed rate residential mortgage loans and adjustable rate residential mortgage arm loans with maturity dates up to years 
such loans generally are underwritten to federal national mortgage association fannie mae standards 
in general  arm loans are retained by the company in its loan portfolio 
fixed rate mortgage loans are generally sold in the secondary market without recourse  although the company typically retains the servicing rights to such loans 
from time to time  the company may elect to retain in its loan portfolio conventional fixed rate loans with maturities of up to years  as well as certain loans with maturities up to years 
as a result of market competition in recent years  the company has generally not charged loan origination fees 
the company also originates jumbo single family mortgage loans in excess of the fannie mae maximum loan amount  which was  for single family homes in its primary market areas in fannie mae has higher limits for two  three and four family homes 
the company retains certain fixed rate jumbo mortgage loans  as well as all arm jumbo mortgage loans  in its portfolio 
the company also originates loans under programs administered by the state veteran s administration state va  the wisconsin housing and economic development authority wheda  the us department of agriculture usda guaranteed rural housing program  and the federal housing administration fha 
loans originated under state va  wheda  and usda programs are not held by the company in its loan portfolio  although the company retains the servicing rights for such loans 
in the case of fha loans  the company receives a fee for its origination services  but does not retain the loan or the servicing rights 
from time to time the company also originates fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans under special programs for low to moderate income households and first time home buyers 
these programs are offered for community reinvestment act cra purposes and are retained by the company in its loan portfolio 
among the features of these programs are lower down payments  no mortgage insurance  and generally less restrictive requirements for qualification compared to the company s conventional one to four family mortgage loans 
these loans generally have maturities up to years 
arm loans pose credit risks different from the risks inherent in fixed rate loans  primarily because as interest rates rise  the underlying payments from the borrowers increase  which increases the potential for payment default 
at the same time  the marketability and or value of the underlying property may be adversely affected by higher interest rates 
arm loans originated by the company are typically adjusted by a maximum of basis points per adjustment period 
the adjustments are usually annual  after the initial interest rate lock period 
the company originates arm loans with lifetime caps set at above the origination rate 
monthly payments of principal and interest are adjusted when the interest rate adjusts 
the company does not offer arm loans with negative amortization 
the company currently utilizes the monthly average yield on united states treasury securities  adjusted to a constant maturity of one year constant maturity treasury index as the index to determine the interest rate payable upon the adjustment date of arm loans 
some of the arm loans are granted with conversion options that provide terms under which the borrower may convert the mortgage loan to a fixed rate mortgage loan for a limited period early in the term normally in the first five years of the arm loan 
the terms at which the arm loan may be converted to a fixed rate loan are established at the date of loan origination and are set to allow the company to sell the loan into the secondary market upon conversion 
the company no longer originates arm loans on an interest only basis whereby the borrower pays interest only during the initial interest rate lock period 
the company s remaining investment in interest only arm loans does not constitute a material portion of its overall loan portfolio 
the volume and types of arm loans the company originates have been affected by the level of market interest rates  competition  consumer preferences  and the availability of funds 
arm loans are susceptible to early prepayment during periods of lower interest rates as borrowers refinance into fixed rate loans 
residential mortgage loan originations are solicited from real estate brokers  builders  existing customers  community groups  other referral sources  and residents of the local communities located in the company s primary market areas through its loan origination staff 
the company also advertises its residential mortgage loan products through local media  direct customer communications  and its website 
most residential mortgage loans are processed under the fannie mae alternative documentation programs 
for alternative documentation loans  the company requires applicants to complete a fannie mae loan application and requests income  asset and debt information from the 
table of contents borrower 
in addition to obtaining outside vendor credit reports on all borrowers  the company also looks at other information to ascertain the creditworthiness of the borrower 
in most instances  the company utilizes fannie mae s desktop underwriter automated underwriting process 
loans that are processed under the alternative documentation program conform to secondary market standards and generally may be sold on the secondary market 
loans originated under fannie mae alternative documentation program should not be confused with alt a loans or no documentation loans ie  no doc loans 
no doc loans  as the name implies  do not require verification of employment  instead  the customer s stated income is used in the underwriting decision 
the company does not offer alt a or no doc loans  nor does it originate or purchase subprime loans 
the company requires an appraisal of the real estate that secures a residential mortgage loan  which must be performed by a certified appraiser approved by the board of directors 
prior to  however  the company used a streamlined process in certain circumstances on existing mortgage loans that were refinanced or modified with the company 
in such instances  the company relied on the original appraisal 
a title insurance policy is required for all real estate first mortgage loans 
evidence of adequate hazard insurance and flood insurance  if applicable  is required prior to closing 
borrowers are required to make monthly payments to fund principal and interest except for interest only arm mortgage loans  which the company no longer originates as well as private mortgage insurance and flood insurance  if applicable 
with some exceptions for lower loan to value ratio loans  borrowers are also generally required to escrow in advance for real estate taxes 
if borrowers with loans having a lower loan to value ratio want to handle their own taxes and insurance  an escrow waiver fee is charged 
with respect to escrowed real estate taxes  the company generally makes this disbursement directly to the borrower as obligations become due 
the company s staff underwriters review all pertinent information prior to making a credit decision on an application 
all recommendations to deny are reviewed by a designated senior officer of the company  in addition to staff underwriters  prior to the final disposition of the application 
the company s lending policies generally limit the maximum loan to value ratio on single family mortgage loans secured by owner occupied properties to of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price of the property 
this limit is lower for loans secured by two  three  and four family homes 
loans above loan to value ratios are subject to private mortgage insurance to reduce the company s exposure to less than of value  except for certain low to moderate income loan program loans 
in addition to servicing the loans in its own portfolio  the company continues to service most of the loans that it sells to fannie mae and other third party investors loans serviced for others 
servicing mortgage loans  whether for its own portfolio or for others  includes such functions as collecting monthly principal and interest payments from borrowers  maintaining escrow accounts for real estate taxes and insurance  and making certain payments on behalf of borrowers 
when necessary  servicing of mortgage loans also includes functions related to the collection of delinquent principal and interest payments  loan foreclosure proceedings  and disposition of foreclosed real estate 
as of december   loans serviced for others amounted to billion 
these loans are not reflected in the company s consolidated statements of financial condition 
when the company services loans for others  it is compensated through the retention of a servicing fee from borrowers monthly payments 
the company pays the third party investors an agreed upon yield on the loans  which is generally less than the interest agreed to be paid by the borrowers 
the difference  typically basis points or more  is retained by the company and recognized as servicing fee income over the lives of the loans  net of amortization of capitalized mortgage servicing rights msrs 
the company also receives fees and interest income from ancillary sources such as delinquency charges and float on escrow and other funds 
management believes that servicing mortgage loans for third parties provides a natural hedge against other risks inherent in the company s mortgage banking operations 
for example  fluctuations in volumes of mortgage loan originations and resulting gains on sales of such loans caused by changes in market interest rates will be partially offset by opposite changes in the amortization of the msrs 
these fluctuations are usually the result of actual loan prepayment activity and or changes in management expectations for future prepayment activity  which impacts the amount of msrs amortized in a given period 
however  fluctuations in the recorded value of msrs may also be caused by valuation adjustments required to be recognized under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
that is  the value of servicing rights may fluctuate because of changes in the future prepayment assumptions or discount rates used to periodically value the msrs 
although management believes that most of the company s loans that prepay are replaced by new loans thus preserving the future servicing cash flow  gaap requires impairment losses resulting from a change in future prepayment assumptions to be recorded when the change occurs 
however  the offsetting gain on the sale of the new loan  if any  cannot be recorded under gaap until the customer actually prepays the old loan and the new loan is sold in the secondary market 
msrs are particularly susceptible to 
table of contents impairment losses during periods of declining interest rates during which prepayment activity typically accelerates to levels above that which had been anticipated when the servicing rights were originally recorded 
alternatively  in periods of increasing interest rates  during which prepayment activity typically declines  the company could potentially recapture through earnings all or a portion of a previously established valuation allowance for impairment 
consumer loans at december   the company s portfolio of consumer loans was million or of its gross loans receivable 
consumer loans include fixed term home equity loans  home equity lines of credit  home improvement loans  automobile loans  recreational vehicle loans  boat loans  deposit account loans  overdraft protection lines of credit  unsecured consumer loans  and to a lesser extent  unsecured consumer loans through credit card programs that are administered by third parties 
in the company ceased offering student loans through programs guaranteed by the federal government due to a lack of profitability 
student loans that continue to be held by the company are administered by a third party 
the company s primary focus in consumer lending has been the origination of loans secured by real estate  which includes home equity loans  home improvement loans  and home equity lines of credit 
underwriting procedures for the home equity and home equity lines of credit loans include a comprehensive review of the loan application  an acceptable credit score  verification of the value of the equity in the home  and verification of the borrower s income 
home equity and home improvement loan originations are developed through the cross sales to existing customers  advertisements in local media  the bank s website  and from time to time  direct mail 
the company originates fixed rate home equity and home improvement term loans with combined loan to value ratios up to 
pricing on fixed rate home equity and home improvement term loans is periodically reviewed by management 
generally  loan terms are in the three to fifteen year range in order to minimize interest rate risk 
prior to the company also originated variable rate home equity and home improvement term loans that had an initial fixed rate for one to three years then adjust annually or monthly depending upon the offering  with terms of up to years 
the company discontinued offering variable rate home equity and home improvement term loans due to increased administrative burdens caused by changes in certain regulatory requirements 
the company continues to originate home equity lines of credit 
home equity lines of credit are variable rate loans secured by a first or second mortgage on owner occupied one to four family residences and second homes 
current interest rates on home equity lines of credit are tied to the prime rate  adjust monthly after an initial interest rate lock period  and range from prime rate minus basis points to prime rate plus basis points  depending on the loan to value ratio 
these loans generally have a floor of  although loans with a combined loan to value ratio greater than have a floor of 
home equity line of credit loans are made for terms up to years and require minimum monthly payments 
consumer loans generally have shorter terms and higher rates of interest than conventional mortgage loans  but typically involve more credit risk because of the nature of the collateral and  in some instances  the absence of collateral 
in general  consumer loans are more dependent upon the borrower s continuing financial stability  more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances  and often secured by rapidly depreciating personal property such as automobiles 
in addition  various laws  including bankruptcy and insolvency laws  may limit the amount that may be recovered from a borrower 
however  such risks are mitigated to some extent in the case of home equity loans and lines of credit 
these types of loans are secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower s residence for which the total principal balance outstanding including the first mortgage does not generally exceed of the property s value at the time of the loan 
the company believes that the higher yields earned on consumer loans compensate for the increased risk associated with such loans and that consumer loans are important to the company s efforts to increase the interest rate sensitivity and shorten the average maturity of its loan portfolio 
in conjunction with its consumer lending activities  the company offers customers credit life and disability insurance products underwritten and administered by an independent insurance provider 
the company receives commission revenue related to the sales of these products  although such amounts are not a material source of revenue for the company 
multi family and commercial real estate loans at december   the company s portfolio of multi family and commercial real estate loans was million or of its gross loans receivable 
the company s multi family and commercial real estate loan portfolios consist of fixed rate and adjustable rate loans originated at prevailing market rates usually tied to various treasury indices 
this portfolio generally consists of loans secured by 
table of contents apartment buildings  office buildings  retail centers  warehouses  and industrial buildings 
these loans typically do not exceed of the lesser of the purchase price or an appraisal by an appraiser designated by us 
loans originated with balloon maturities are generally amortized on a to year basis with a typical balloon term of to years 
loans secured by multi family and commercial real estate are granted based on the income producing potential of the property  the financial strength of the borrower  and the appraised value of the property 
in most cases  the company also obtains personal guarantees from the principals involved 
the company s approval process includes a review of the other debt obligations and overall sources of flow available to the borrower and guarantors 
the property s net operating income must be sufficient to cover the payments relating to the outstanding debt 
the company generally requires an assignment of rents or leases to be assured that the cash flow from the property will be used to repay the debt 
appraisals on properties securing multi family and larger commercial real estate loans are performed by independent state certified fee appraisers approved by the board of directors 
title and hazard insurance are required as well as flood insurance  if applicable 
environmental assessments are performed on certain multi family and commercial real estate loans in excess of million  as well as all loans secured by certain properties that the company considers to be environmentally sensitive 
in addition  an annual review is performed on non owner occupied multi family and commercial real estate loans over million 
loans secured by multi family and commercial real estate properties are generally larger and involve a greater degree of credit risk than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
such loans typically involve large balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers 
because payments on loans secured by multi family and commercial real estate properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties  repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy 
in recent periods the company has noted that borrowers problems in areas unrelated to the properties that secure the company s loans may have an adverse impact on such borrowers ability to comply with the terms of the company s loans 
the bank s largest individual multi family and commercial real estate loans  as well as its largest individual construction and development and commercial business loans described below  are below the bank s legal lending limit to a single borrower  which was approximately million at december  however  the bank has an internal lending limit that is adjusted from time to time and is lower than its legal lending limit 
construction and development loans at december   the company s portfolio of construction and development loans was million or of its gross loans receivable 
these loans typically have terms of to months  are interest only  and carry variable interest rates tied to the prime rate 
disbursements on these loans are based on draw requests supported by appropriate lien waivers 
as a general matter  construction loans convert to permanent loans and remain in the company s loan portfolio upon the completion of the project 
development loans are typically repaid as the underlying lots or housing units are sold 
construction and development loans are generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk than mortgage loans on completed properties 
the company s risk of loss on a construction and development loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property s value at completion of construction  the estimated cost of construction  and the borrower s ability to advance additional construction funds if necessary 
in addition  in the event a borrower defaults on the loan during its construction phase  the construction project often needs to be completed before the full value of the collateral can be realized by the company 
due to the economic environment  the company suspended development lending in  although it continues to engage in construction lending when the circumstances warrant 
the company is uncertain at this time when it will reinstate development lending 
commercial business loans at december   the company s portfolio of commercial business loans was million or of its gross loans receivable 
this portfolio consists of loans to businesses for equipment purchases  working capital term loans and lines of credit  debt refinancing  small business administration sba loans  and domestic standby letters of credit 
typically  these loans are secured by general business security agreements  owner occupied real estate  and personal guarantees 
the company offers variable  adjustable  and fixed rate commercial business loans 
the company also has commercial business loans that have an initial period where interest rates are fixed  generally one to five years  and thereafter are adjustable based on various indices 
fixed rate loans are priced at either a margin over the yield on us treasury issues with maturities that correspond to the maturities of the notes or to match competitive conditions and yield requirements 
term loans are generally amortized over a three to seven year period and line of credit commercial business loans generally have a term of one year and  in the case of small lines of credit  up to five years 
all borrowers having an exposure to the company of  or more are reviewed annually  unless it is an investment real estate loan at which point the annual review occurs for loans over million

all secured business loans over  or unsecured loans over  require approval of the executive loan committee of the board of directors 
all loans approved by individuals and senior officers must be ratified by the executive loan committee of the board of directors at its next meeting following the approval 
asset quality general the company has policies and procedures in place to manage its exposure to credit risk related to its lending operations 
as a matter of policy  the company limits its lending to geographic areas in which it has substantial familiarity and or a physical presence 
currently  this is limited to certain specific market areas in wisconsin and contiguous states 
in addition  from time to time the company will prohibit or restrict lending in situations in which the underlying business operations and or collateral exceed management s tolerance for risk 
for example  in the company suspended the origination of loans secured by hotels  motels  resort properties  restaurants  and bars and in suspended land development loans  as previously noted 
the company obtains appraisals or similar estimates of value prior to the origination of mortgage loans or other secured loans 
it also manages its exposure to risk by regularly monitoring loan payment status  conducting periodic site visits and inspections  obtaining regular financial updates from large borrowers and or guarantors  corresponding regularly with large borrowers and or guarantors  and or updating appraisals as appropriate  among other things 
these procedures are emphasized when a borrower has failed to make scheduled loan payments  has otherwise defaulted on the terms of the loan agreement  or when management has become aware of a significant adverse change in the financial 
table of contents condition of the borrower  guarantor  or underlying collateral 
these strategies  as well as a continued emphasis on quality loan underwriting  maintenance of sound credit standards for new loan originations  and annual evaluation of large credits have generally resulted in delinquency and non performing asset ratios below the national average  although there can be no assurances that this will continue 
for specific information relating to the company s asset quality for the periods covered by this report  refer to financial condition asset quality in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
internal risk ratings and classified assets federal regulations require thrift institutions to classify their assets on a regular basis 
accordingly  the company has internal policies and procedures in place to internally evaluate risk ratings on all of its loans and certain other assets 
in general  these internal risk ratings correspond with regulatory requirements to adversely classify problem loans and certain other assets as substandard  doubtful  or loss 
a loan or other asset is adversely classified as substandard if it is determined to involve a distinct possibility that the company could sustain some loss if deficiencies associated with the loan are not corrected 
a loan or other asset is adversely classified as doubtful if full collection is highly questionable or improbable 
a loan or other asset is adversely classified as loss if it is considered uncollectible  even if a partial recovery could be expected in the future 
if an asset or portion thereof is classified as loss  the company typically charges off such amount 
the regulations also provide for a special mention designation  described as loans or assets which do not currently expose the company to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant adverse classification  but which demonstrate clear trends in credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving management s close attention refer to the following paragraph for additional discussion 
loans that are not classified special mention or adversely classified as substandard  doubtful  or loss are classified as pass or watch in accordance with the company s internal risk rating policy 
pass loans are generally current on contractual loan and principal payments  comply with other contractual loan terms  and have no noticeable credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses 
watch loans are also generally current on payments and in compliance with loan terms  but a particular borrower s financial or operating conditions may exhibit early signs of credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention 
such deficiencies and or weaknesses typically include  but are not limited to  the borrower s financial or operating condition  deterioration in liquidity  increased financial leverage  declines in the condition or value of related collateral  recent changes management or business strategy  or recent developments in the economic  competitive  or market environment of the borrower 
if adverse observations noted in these areas are not corrected  further downgrade of the loan may be warranted 
delinquent loans when a borrower fails to make required payments on a loan  the company takes a number of steps to induce the borrower to cure the delinquency and restore the loan to a current status 
in the case of one to four family mortgage loans  the company s loan servicing department is responsible for collection procedures from the th day of delinquency through the completion of foreclosure 
specific procedures include a late charge notice being sent at the time a payment is over days past due with a second notice in the form of a billing coupon being sent before the payment becomes days past due 
once the account is days past due  the company attempts telephone contact with the borrower 
letters are sent if contact has not been established by the th day of delinquency 
on the th day of delinquency  attempts at telephone contact continue and stronger letters  including foreclosure notices  are sent 
if telephone contact cannot be made  the company sends either a qualified third party inspector or a loan officer to the property in an effort to contact the borrower 
when contact is made with the borrower  the company attempts to obtain full payment or work out a repayment schedule to avoid foreclosure of the collateral 
many borrowers pay before the agreed upon payment deadline and it is not necessary to start a foreclosure action 
the collection procedures and guidelines as outlined by fannie mae  freddie mac  state va  wheda  and guaranteed rural housing are followed by the company 
the collection procedures for consumer loans  excluding student loans and credit card loans  include sending periodic late notices to a borrower once a loan is to days past due depending upon the grace period associated with a loan 
the company attempts to make direct contact with a borrower once a loan becomes days past due 
if collection activity is unsuccessful  the company may pursue legal remedies itself  refer the matter to legal counsel for further collection effort  seek foreclosure or repossession of the collateral if any  or charge off the loan 
all student loans are serviced by a third party  which guarantees its servicing to comply with all us department of education guidelines 
the company s student loan portfolio is guaranteed under programs sponsored by the us government 
credit card loans are serviced by a third party administrator 
the collection procedures for multi family  commercial real estate  and commercial business loans include sending periodic late notices to a borrower once a loan is past due 
the company attempts to make direct contact with a borrower once a loan becomes days past due 
the company s managers of the multi family and commercial real 
table of contents estate loan areas review loans days or more delinquent on a regular basis 
if collection activity is unsuccessful  the company may refer the matter to legal counsel for further collection effort 
after days  loans that are delinquent are typically proposed for repossession or foreclosure 
legal action requires the approval of the executive loan committee of the board of directors 
in working with delinquent borrowers  if the company cannot develop a repayment plan that substantially complies with the original terms of the loan agreement  the company s practice has been to pursue foreclosure or repossession of the underlying collateral 
as a matter of practice  the company does not restructure or modify troubled loans in a manner that results in a loss under accounting rules 
furthermore  the company does not generally reclassify restructured or modified loans as performing loans if such loans were non performing prior to the restructuring or modification 
the company s policies require that management continuously monitor the status of the loan portfolio and report to the board of directors on a monthly basis 
these reports include information on classified loans  delinquent loans  restructured or modified loans  allowance for loan losses  and foreclosed real estate 
non accrual policy with the exception of student loans that are guaranteed by the us government  the company generally stops accruing interest income on loans when interest or principal payments are days or more in arrears or earlier when the future collectibility of such interest or principal payments may no longer be certain 
in recent periods  the company has experienced an increase in loans that meet the latter designation 
in such cases  borrowers have often been able to maintain a current payment status  but are experiencing financial difficulties and or the properties that secure the loans are experiencing increased vacancies  declining lease rates  and or delays in unit sales 
in such instances  management may stop accruing interest income on the loans even though the borrowers are current with respect to all contractual payments 
although the company may no longer accrue interest on these loans  the company may continue to record periodic interest payments received on such loans in interest income provided the borrowers remain current on the loans and provided  in the judgment of management  the company s net recorded investment in the loans are deemed to be collectible 
the company designates loans on which it stops accruing interest income as non accrual loans and establishes a reserve for outstanding interest that was previously credited to income 
all loans on non accrual are considered to be impaired 
the company returns a non accrual loan to accrual status when factors indicating doubtful or uncertain collection no longer exist 
in general  non accrual loans are also adversely classified as substandard or doubtful in accordance with the company s internal risk rating policy 
foreclosed properties and repossessed assets in the case of loans secured by real estate  foreclosure action generally starts when the loan is between the th and th day of delinquency following review by a senior officer and the executive loan committee of the board of directors 
if  based on this review  the company determines that repayment of a loan is solely dependent on the liquidation of the collateral  the company will typically seek the shortest redemption period possible  thus waiving its right to collect any deficiency from the borrower and or guarantor 
depending on whether the company has waived this right and a variety of other factors outside the company s control including the legal actions of borrowers to protect their interests  an extended period of time could transpire between the commencement of a foreclosure action by the company and its ultimate receipt of title to the property 
when the company ultimately obtains title to the property through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure  it transfers the property to foreclosed properties and repossessed assets on the company s consolidated statements of financial condition 
in cases in which a borrower has surrendered control of the property to the company or has otherwise abandoned the property  the company may transfer the property to foreclosed properties as an in substance foreclosure prior to actual receipt of title 
foreclosed properties and repossessed assets are adversely classified as substandard or doubtful in accordance with the company s internal risk rating policy 
marketing of foreclosed real estate begins immediately following the company taking title to the property 
the marketing is usually undertaken by a realtor knowledgeable with the particular market 
mortgage insurance claims are filed if the loan had mortgage insurance coverage 
the property is marketed after an appraisal is obtained and any mortgage insurance claims are filed 
foreclosed real estate properties are initially recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan or fair value 
thereafter  the company carries foreclosed real estate at fair value less estimated selling costs typically to 
foreclosed real estate is inspected periodically 
additional outside appraisals are obtained as deemed necessary or appropriate 
additional write downs may occur if the property value deteriorates further after it is acquired 
these additional write downs are charged to the company s results of operations as they occur 

table of contents in the case of loans secured by assets other than real estate  action to repossess the underlying collateral generally starts when the loan is between the th and th day of delinquency following review by management 
the accounting for repossessed assets is similar to that described for real estate  above 
loan charge offs the company typically records loan charge offs at foreclosure  repossession  or liquidation and or when the loan is otherwise deemed uncollectible 
the amount of the charge off will depend on the fair market value of the underlying collateral  if any  and may be zero if the fair market value exceeds the loan amount 
all charge offs are recorded as a reduction to allowance for loan losses 
all charge off activity is reviewed by the board of directors 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and is based on factors such as the size and current risk characteristics of the portfolio  an assessment of individual problem loans and pools of homogenous loans within the portfolio  and actual loss  delinquency  and or risk rating experience within the portfolio 
the company also considers current economic conditions and or events in specific industries and geographical areas  including unemployment levels  trends in real estate values  peer comparisons  and other pertinent factors  to include regulatory guidance 
finally  as appropriate  the company also considers individual borrower circumstances and the condition and fair value of the loan collateral  if any 
for additional information relating to the company s allowance for loan losses for the periods covered by this report  refer to results of operations provision for loan losses and financial condition asset quality in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
determination of the allowance is inherently subjective as it requires significant management judgment and estimates  including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on loans  the fair value of underlying collateral if any  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  changes in risk characteristics of the loan portfolio  and consideration of current economic trends  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
higher rates of loan defaults than anticipated would likely result in a need to increase provisions in future years 
also  increases in the company s multi family  commercial real estate  construction and development  and commercial business loan portfolios  could result in a higher allowance for loan losses as these loans typically carry a higher risk of loss 
finally  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination processes  periodically review the company s loan and foreclosed real estate portfolios and the related allowance for loan losses and valuation allowance for foreclosed real estate 
one or more of these agencies  specifically the ots  may require the company to increase the allowance for loan losses or the valuation allowance for foreclosed real estate based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination  thereby adversely affecting the company s results of operations 
as a result of applying management judgment  it is possible that there may be periods when the amount of the allowance and or its percentage to total loans or non performing loans may decrease even though non performing loans may increase 
periodic adjustments to the allowance for loan loss are recorded through provision for loan losses in the company s consolidated statements of income 
actual losses on loans are charged off against the allowance when the loan is deemed uncollectible 
in the case of loans secured by real estate  this typically occurs when the company receives title to the property as a result of a formal foreclosure proceeding  receipt of a deed in lieu of foreclosure  or when  in the judgment of management  an in substance foreclosure has occurred 
for loans that are not secured by real estate  charge off typically occurs when the collateral is repossessed 
unsecured loans are charged off when the loan is determined to be uncollectible 
recoveries of loan amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance as received 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a monthly basis 
the board of directors reviews management s judgments related to the allowance for loan loss on at least a quarterly basis 
the company maintains general allowances for loan loss against certain homogenous pools of loans 
these pools generally consist of smaller one to four family  multi family  commercial real estate  consumer  and commercial business loans that do not warrant individual review due to their size 
in addition  pools may also consist of larger multi family  commercial real estate  and commercial business loans that have not been individually identified as impaired by management 
certain of these pools  such as the one to four family and consumer loan pools  are further segmented according to the nature of the collateral that secures the loans 
for example  the consumer loan pool is segmented by collateral type  such as loans secured by real estate  loans secured by automobiles  and loans secured by other collateral 
the various loan pools are further segmented by management s internal risk rating of the loans 
management has developed factors for each pool or segment based on the historical loss experience of each pool or segment  recent delinquency performance  internal risk ratings  and consideration of current economic trends  
table of contents in order to determine what it believes is an appropriate level for the general allowance 
given the significant amount of management judgment involved in this process there could be significant variation in the company s allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses from period to period 
the company maintains specific allowances for loan loss against individual loans that have been identified by management as impaired 
these loans are generally larger loans  but management may also establish specific allowances against smaller loans from time to time 
the allowance for loan loss established against these loans is based on one of two methods the present value of the future cash flows expected to be received from the borrower  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or the fair value of the loan collateral  if the loan is considered to be collateral dependent 
in the company s experience  loss allowances using the first method have been rare 
in working with problem borrowers  if the company cannot develop a repayment plan that substantially complies with the original terms of the loan agreement  the company s practice has been to pursue foreclosure or repossession of the underlying collateral 
as a matter of practice  the company does not restructure troubled loans in a manner that results in a loss under the first method 
as a result  most loss allowances are established using the second method because the related loans have been deemed collateral dependent by management 
management considers loans to be collateral dependent when  in its judgment  there is no source of repayment for the loan other than the ultimate sale or disposition of the underlying collateral 
factors management considers in making this determination typically include  but are not limited to  the length of time a borrower has been delinquent with respect to loan payments  the nature and extent of the financial or operating difficulties experienced by the borrower  the performance of the underlying collateral  the availability of other sources of cash flow or net worth of the borrower and or guarantor  and the borrower s immediate prospects to return the loan to performing status 
in some instances  because of the facts and circumstances surrounding a particular loan relationship  there could be an extended period of time between management s identification of a problem loan and a determination that it is probable that such loan is or will become collateral dependent 
based on recent experience  however  management has noted the length of time shorten between when a loan is classified as non performing and when it is consider to be collateral dependent 
in management s view  this development is attributable to the deterioration in commercial real estate markets during and management believes this is a trend that will continue as long as economic conditions and or commercial real estate values remain depressed 
when a loan becomes collateral dependent  management measures impairment based on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral 
such estimates are based on management s judgment or  when considered appropriate  on an updated appraisal or similar evaluation 
updated appraisals are also typically obtained on or about the time of foreclosure or repossession of the underlying collateral 
prior to receipt of the updated appraisal  management has typically relied on the original appraisal and knowledge of the condition of the collateral  as well as the current market for the collateral  to estimate the company s exposure to loss on a collateral dependent loan 
in the judgment of management  this practice was acceptable in periods of relative stability in real estate markets 
however  as a result of deterioration in commercial real estate markets during and  as well as the company s recent experience  management believes that as long as economic conditions and or real estate markets remain depressed updated appraisals will continue to be obtained on collateral dependent loans earlier in the evaluation process than may have been typical during periods of more stable real estate markets 
for collateral dependent loans  the company records allowance for loan losses and related provisions on each loan for which it is determined that the fair value of the collateral is less than the carrying value of the loan balance 
this is true regardless of whether the estimate of fair value is based on an updated appraisal or on an internal management assessment
