item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading global provider of medical technology products that enable healthcare providers to improve patient outcomes  reduce infections and enhance patient and provider safety 
we primarily develop  manufacture and supply single use medical devices used by hospitals and healthcare providers for common diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in critical care and surgical applications 
we serve hospitals and healthcare providers in more than countries and are not dependent upon any one end market or procedure 
we are focused on achieving consistent  sustainable and profitable growth through the introduction of new products and product line extensions  expanding our geographic reach  leveraging our existing distribution channels  further investment in global sales and marketing  and select acquisitions which enhance or expedite our development initiatives and our ability to increase our market share 
furthermore  we believe our research and development capabilities and our commitment to engineering excellence and lean  low cost manufacturing allow us to consistently bring cost effective  innovative products to market that improve the safety  efficacy  and quality of healthcare 
we provide a broad based platform of medical products  which we categorize into four groups critical care  surgical care  cardiac care and oem and development services 
we have employed a disciplined portfolio management strategy to transform teleflex into primarily a medical technology company 
we expect to continue to increase the relative composition of our medical segment through a combination of portfolio management and organic growth initiatives 
we may seek acquisition opportunities that augment our existing medical technology platform and disposition opportunities that enable us to further our transformation into a pure play medical technology company 
furthermore  our commitment to becoming a pure play global medical technology company involves investing in our medical research and development and sales and marketing initiatives to further expand and strengthen our portfolio of products as well as our ability to penetrate existing and new geographic and therapeutic markets 
while we are committed to becoming a pure play medical technology company  we continue to have businesses that serve other non medical niche segments of the aerospace and commercial markets with specialty engineered products 
we expect to strategically divest our non core aerospace and commercial segments over time 
our aerospace products include cargo handling systems  containers  and pallets for commercial air cargo 
our commercial products include driver controls  engine assemblies and drive parts for the marine industry

these portfolio actions resulted in a significant expansion of our medical segment operations and a significant reduction in our aerospace and commercial segment operations 
as a result  our medical segment now accounts for approximately of our revenues from continuing operations and over of our segment operating profit 
below is a listing of our more significant acquisitions and divestitures that have occurred since the results for the acquired businesses are included in their respective segments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k filed for additional information regarding our significant divestitures

december divested business units that design and manufacture automotive and industrial driver controls  motion systems and fluid handling systems the gms businesses  to kongsberg automotive holdings for million in cash and realized a gain of million  net of tax 
health care reform on march  the patient protection and affordable care act was signed into law 
while providing some clarity on the impact of reform to our industry  this legislation will nevertheless have a significant impact on our business 
for medical device companies such as teleflex  the expansion of medical insurance coverage should lead to greater utilization of the products we manufacture  but this legislation also contains provisions designed to contain the cost of healthcare  which could negatively affect pricing of our products 
in addition  commencing in  the legislation imposes a excise tax on sales of medical devices 
as this new law is implemented over the next years  we will be in a better position to ascertain its impact on our business 
we currently estimate the impact of the medical device excise tax will be approximately million annually  beginning in also in the first quarter of  we evaluated the change in the tax regulations related to the medicare part d subsidy as currently outlined in the new legislation and determined that it did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
global economic conditions global recessionary conditions during and had adverse impacts on market activities including  among other things  failure of financial institutions  falling asset values  diminished liquidity  and reduced demand for products and services of the past few years 
for teleflex  these economic developments principally affected our aerospace and commercial segments and in response  we adjusted production levels and engaged in new restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of and in the first half of although  on a consolidated basis  the economic conditions did not have a significant adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity during and  the continuation of the present broad economic trends of weak economic growth  constricted credit and public sector austerity measures in response to growing public budget deficits could adversely affect our operations in the future  as described below 
the potential effect of these factors on our current and future liquidity is discussed below under liquidity and capital resources in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
medical our medical segment serves a diverse base of hospitals and healthcare providers in more than countries 
healthcare policies and practice trends vary by country  and the impact of the 
table of contents global economic downturn was felt to varying degrees in each of our regional markets during and hospitals in some regions of the united states experienced a decline in admissions  a weaker payor mix  and a reduction in elective procedures 
hospitals consequently took actions to reduce their costs  including limiting their capital spending 
distributors in the supply chain reduced inventory levels during and generally did not replenish inventories to pre recession levels during the impact of these actions was most pronounced in capital goods markets  which affected our surgical instrument and cardiac assist businesses 
our orthopedic oem business was impacted in by delayed new product launches by our oem customers 
this has improved somewhat during  but has not returned to pre recession levels 
approximately percent of our medical revenues come from disposable products used in critical care and surgical applications  and our sales volume could be negatively impacted if hospital admission rates or payor mix decline further as a result of continuing high unemployment rates and subsequent loss of insurance coverage by consumers 
in europe  some countries have taken austerity measures due to the current economic climate 
elective surgeries have been delayed and hospital budgets have been reduced 
in certain countries mainly germany we have seen changes in the local reimbursement to home care patients and pricing impacts on business awarded through the tendering process 
these markets have introduced more buying groups and gpo s driving commodity product pricing downwards 
it is possible that funding for publically funded healthcare institutions could be affected in the future as governments make further spending adjustments and enact healthcare reform measures to lower overall healthcare costs 
during  the public healthcare systems in certain countries in western europe  most notably greece  spain  portugal and italy  have experienced reduced liquidity due to recessionary conditions  which has resulted in a slow down in payments to us 
we believe this situation will continue unless and until these countries are able to find alternative funding sources to their respective public healthcare sectors 
in  sales into the public hospital systems in these countries were approximately of our total sales 
in asia  recovery from the global recession varies by country 
china has announced plans for major healthcare investment targeted at second tier cities hospitals  which may provide future growth opportunities for us  while slow economic growth and continued pursuit of reimbursement cuts by the public hospital sector in japan will limit growth in that market 
aerospace sudden and significant increases in fuel costs in mid resulted in reductions in capacity for passenger and cargo traffic  and accelerated retirement of older  less fuel efficient aircraft 
however  operating results improved somewhat as the sharp drop in fuel costs toward the end of partially offset the recession related drop in revenues for both passenger and cargo traffic due to the economic crisis in the lower traffic reduced demand and made it more difficult to sell cargo containment equipment  but new aircraft production and weight and greenhouse gas reduction objectives have created some opportunities in these markets 
in  conditions in the commercial aviation markets improved  and we believe we are well positioned on certain new airbus and boeing airframes  and we expect deliveries of cargo handling systems to continue at previously expected levels overall  albeit over a slightly longer time horizon than what we initially anticipated 
commercial the markets served by our commercial segment are largely affected by the general state of the economy and by consumer confidence 
factors such as housing starts  home values  fuel costs  environmental and other regulatory matters all affect the market outlook for the businesses in this segment 
very high fuel prices in began a trend of declining demand in the recreational marine market and the global recession that followed caused this trend to continue in in spite of moderating fuel costs 
in  although the recreational boating market recovered somewhat 
table of contents from its depressed levels of  we expect that growth will be limited in our commercial segment until there is more robust global economic growth  the pace of consumer deleveraging slows down and consumer confidence improves 
results of operations discussion of growth from acquisitions reflects the impact of a purchased company for up to twelve months beyond the date of acquisition 
activity beyond the initial twelve months is considered core growth 
core growth excludes the impact of translating the results of international subsidiaries at different currency exchange rates from year to year and the comparable activity of divested companies within the most recent twelve month period 
the following comparisons exclude the impact of the operations of the actuation  heavy lift  ssi  ati and power systems businesses which have been presented in our consolidated financial results as discontinued operations see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k and discontinued operations in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for discussion of discontinued operations 
revenues dollars in millions net revenues net revenues increased approximately to billion in from billion in core growth was  which was partially offset by the decline in revenue attributed to the disposition of a product line in the commercial segment during the first quarter of and the deconsolidation of a variable interest entity in our medical segment in the first quarter of due to the adoption of new accounting guidance 
core revenues were higher in the aerospace segment due to improving conditions in commercial aviation markets  and higher in the commercial segment as recreational boating markets recover from the depressed levels of core revenues in the medical segment were higher than as the negative impact of a voluntary recall of a product in our critical care product group and lower sales of orthopedic devices sold to medical original equipment manufacturers  or oems  was more than offset by higher sales of other critical care and surgical products 
net revenues decreased approximately to billion in from billion in a reduction in core revenues caused of the decline while foreign currency movements caused the other of the decline 
as a result of core growth in the fourth quarter in the medical segment  core revenue in that segment was flat in compared to  but core revenue declined in the aerospace and commercial segments by and  respectively in compared to weak global economic conditions negatively impacted markets served by our aerospace and commercial segments throughout gross profit dollars in millions gross profit percentage of sales gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased in each of our three segments compared to the corresponding periods of  with the most pronounced increase in the aerospace segment as a result of core growth  manufacturing efficiencies and a sales mix favoring higher margin spare components and repairs 

table of contents gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in  with all three segments experiencing increases in gross profit as a percentage of revenues 
the principal factors that impact the overall increase were a higher percentage of medical revenues of total revenues in compared to in  a million fair value adjustment to inventory in the first quarter of related to inventory acquired in the arrow acquisition  which did not recur in  synergies from the arrow acquisition and manufacturing cost reductions implemented in each of our three segments  partly offset by higher pension expense in because of the decline in the value of our pension assets at the end of as a result of losses experienced in the global equity markets 
selling  general and administrative dollars in millions selling  general and administrative percentage of sales selling  general and administrative expenses operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were in compared to in the million increase in costs was principally related to million in higher costs in the medical segment largely due to investments in sales  marketing  and clinical education programs of approximately million  approximately million of costs associated with product recall and remediation activities  partially offset by approximately million lower spending on remediation of fda regulatory issues 
professional fees incurred in connection with our debt refinancing during the third quarter of of approximately million was offset by reductions in the aerospace and commercial segments and corporate costs of approximately million 
selling  general and administrative expenses operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were in compared to in the reduction in the dollar value of these costs was principally the result of cost reduction initiatives throughout the company  including restructuring and integration activities in connection with the arrow acquisition and the commercial segment restructuring program  and lower spending on remediation of fda regulatory issues 
these factors resulted in an aggregate reduction in expenses of approximately million 
research and development dollars in millions research and development percentage of sales research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues were in compared to in higher levels of research and development expenses over the two year period reflect increased investments related to antimicrobial technologies and the establishment of an innovation center in malaysia 
goodwill impairment dollars in millions goodwill impairment during the second quarter of  we performed an interim review of goodwill for our cargo container reporting unit as a result of the difficult market conditions confronting the reporting unit and the significant deterioration in its operating performance  which accelerated in the second quarter of upon conclusion of this review  we determined that goodwill in the cargo container operations was impaired  and we recorded an impairment charge of million in the second quarter of

the effective tax rate in was compared to in taxes on income from continuing operations in were million compared to million in the decrease in the effective tax rate was due to i a decrease in deferred state tax liabilities resulting from changes to applicable state tax laws and ii a reduction in reserves for uncertain tax positions as audits and settlements were closed  and fewer new reserves were established than in the prior year 

table of contents restructuring and other impairment charges dollars in millions commercial restructuring program arrow integration program restructuring programs aggregate impairment charges investments and certain fixed assets total in december  we began certain restructuring initiatives that affect the commercial segment 
these initiatives involved the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce at three of our facilities in europe and north america 
we implemented these initiatives as a means to address expected weaknesses in the marine and industrial markets 
by december   we completed the commercial segment restructuring program and all costs associated with the program were fully paid during therefore  no charges were recorded under this program in in connection with the acquisition of arrow during  we formulated a plan related to the integration of arrow and our other medical businesses 
the integration plan focused on the closure of arrow corporate functions and the consolidation of manufacturing  sales  marketing  and distribution functions in north america  europe and asia 
costs related to actions that affect employees and facilities of arrow have been included in the allocation of the purchase price of arrow and are not included in these results 
costs related to actions that affect employees and facilities of teleflex are charged to earnings and included in restructuring and impairment charges within the consolidated statement of operations 
these costs amounted to approximately million during as of december   we expect future restructuring and impairment charges that we will incur in connection with the arrow integration plan  if any  will be nominal 
in june  we began certain restructuring initiatives that affected all three of our operating segments 
these initiatives involved the consolidation of operations and a related reduction in workforce at several of our facilities in europe and north america

critical care critical care revenues in were negatively impacted approximately million when compared to due to the recall of our custom iv tubing product during the first quarter of  which contributed to a decline in vascular access sales 
this decline was offset by higher sales of other vascular access and urology products in north america and europe  anesthesia products in europe  north america and asia latin america and respiratory products in north america and asia latin america compared with the prior year 
surgical care surgical core revenue increased in compared to  primarily due to higher ligation sales in asia latin america and europe  partially offset by lower sales of general instrument and closure devices in north america 
cardiac care sales of cardiac care products in compared to were affected positively by higher sales of intra aortic balloon pumps and catheters  primarily in european markets  offset by an approximate million impact from the recall of certain intra aortic balloon catheters during the fourth quarter of original equipment manufacturers oem and development services sales of devices to oems increased approximately million in compared to core revenue to oems increased in compared with this increase is largely attributable to higher sales of specialty suture and catheter fabrication products  partially offset by lower sales of orthopedic implant products and forged instruments due to customer inventory rebalancing and a reduction in new product launches by oem customers 
medical segment operating profit decreased in from million in to million in operating results for were negatively impacted by approximately million in costs associated with the recall and remediation of our custom iv tubing product and certain intra aortic balloon catheters and a factory shut down associated with the custom iv tubing product  approximately million for other product remediation activities  approximately million in higher research and development costs  and approximately million in higher costs for sales  marketing  and clinical education programs 
these factors more than offset the positive contribution of approximately million from higher sales volumes of products not affected by 
table of contents the impact of product recalls  approximately million lower manufacturing costs as a result of cost reduction initiatives and approximately million lower expenses related to the remediation of fda regulatory issues 
comparison of and medical segment net revenues declined in to  million  from  million in  entirely due to foreign currency fluctuations  mainly the stronger us dollar against the euro during the first three quarters of in the aggregate  we experienced no growth in core revenue in over  as growth in critical care products in europe and asia latin america of approximately million was offset by approximately million lower sales of orthopedic instrumentation products to oems in north america and approximately million lower sales of surgical products in north america and europe 
critical care the decrease in critical care product sales during compared to was entirely due to currency fluctuations as core revenue in this product group increased approximately in higher sales of vascular access  urology and anesthesia products of approximately million were partially offset by approximately million lower sales of respiratory products  principally as a result of distributor de stocking in north america in early surgical care surgical product sales declined approximately in compared to foreign currency movements negatively impacted sales by approximately  and lower sales in the instrumentation product line in europe and north america led the decline in core revenue 
we believe this decline in sales resulted from hospitals limiting their capital budgets for these products and distributors reducing inventory in the supply chain 
cardiac care the decrease in sales of cardiac care products in compared to is mainly due to currency movements  hospital capital budget constraints and a voluntary product recall during the first quarter of oem and development services sales of devices to oems decreased primarily as a result of approximately million lower sales of orthopedic instrumentation as higher sales of specialty sutures and other devices of approximately million was offset by the impact of currency movements 
a reduction in new product launches by oem customers and overall weakness in oem orthopedic markets due to hospital budgetary constraints and postponement of certain elective surgical procedures have had a negative impact on demand for our orthopedic instrumentation products 
operating profit in the medical segment increased in to million  from million in the negative impact on operating profit from a stronger us dollar during the first three quarters of was more than offset by approximately million of lower manufacturing and selling  general and administrative costs during as a result of cost reduction initiatives  including restructuring and integration activities in connection with the arrow acquisition  and approximately million lower expenses related to the remediation of fda regulatory issues 
also  a million expense for fair value adjustment to inventory in the first quarter of related to inventory acquired in the arrow acquisition  which did not recur in  had a favorable impact on the comparison of operating profit to the prior year 

table of contents aerospace comparison of and aerospace segment net revenues increased in to million  from million in during  core revenue increased  while currency movements decreased sales by 
the core growth is due principally to improvement in the commercial aviation market  particularly in the second half of  which led to higher sales of wide body cargo handling systems  cargo system spare components and repairs and cargo containers 
segment operating profit increased in to million  compared to million in the higher operating profit in compared to the same period of was primarily due to approximately million in higher sales volumes  approximately million resulting from a favorable sales mix of higher margin cargo system spare components and repairs  and approximately million in manufacturing efficiencies achieved in the production of cargo containers and wide body cargo handling systems for aircraft manufacturers 
comparison of and aerospace segment net revenues declined in to million  from million in core revenue reductions accounted for nearly all of the decline in revenue 
weakness in the commercial aviation sector throughout resulted in reduced sales to commercial airlines and freight carriers of wide body cargo spare components and repairs and cargo containers 
this market weakness has also reduced the number of aftermarket cargo system conversions  resulting in lower sales of multi deck wide body cargo handling systems  which offset the impact of higher sales of single deck wide body systems on passenger aircraft 
segment operating profit decreased in to million  from million in this decline was principally due to the sharply lower sales volumes across all product lines  including the unfavorable mix in of lower margin single deck system sales compared with a mix in that was weighted more toward aftermarket multi deck system conversions and spares and repairs 
the impact from lower sales volumes was partially offset by cost reduction initiatives that resulted in operating cost reductions of approximately million during commercial comparison of and commercial segment net revenues increased approximately in to million  from million in core growth of and favorable currency movements of were partially offset by the impact from the divestiture of a marine product line in the first quarter of 
higher sales of marine products to oem manufacturers for the recreational boat market and spare parts in the marine aftermarket accounted for of sales growth while lower sales of industrial non marine products negatively impacted sales growth by 
commercial segment operating income increased to million  compared to million for the same period last year 
this increase principally was due to approximately million in higher sales volumes of marine products to oem manufacturers for the recreational boat market and spare parts in the marine aftermarket  as well as a reduction in factory costs of approximately million resulting from facility consolidations in  partially offset by the stronger canadian dollar  which resulted in a negative impact on our costs of approximately million 

table of contents comparison of and commercial segment net revenues declined by approximately in to million  from million in core revenue reductions accounted for of the decline  which was principally the result of a decrease in sales of marine products to oem manufacturers for the recreational boat market  partially offset by approximately million of higher sales of the modern burner unit to the us military 
in  segment operating profit decreased to million compared to million in this decrease was principally due to the lower sales volumes of marine products to oem manufacturers for the recreational boat market  which more than offset the impact from the elimination of approximately million of operating costs in and higher sales of the modern burner unit to the us military 
liquidity and capital resources we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating  investing and financing activities 
our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows 
in addition to operating cash flows  other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include capital expenditures  acquisitions  pension funding  dividends  common stock repurchases  adequacy of available bank lines of credit  and access to other capital markets 
we currently do not foresee any difficulties in meeting our cash requirements or accessing credit as needed in the next twelve months 
to date  we have not experienced an inordinate amount of payment defaults by our customers  and we have sufficient lending commitments in place to enable us to fund our anticipated additional operating needs 
however  in light of global economic conditions over the past few years  there is a risk that our customers and suppliers may be unable to access liquidity 
if global economic conditions deteriorate  we may experience delays in customer payments and reductions in our customers purchases from us  which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
the deterioration in the securities markets that occurred during and the subsequent moderate recovery in these markets during and impacted the market value of the assets included in our defined benefit pension plans 
as a result of these market fluctuations  the market value of assets in our domestic pension funds declined in value by approximately million during and recovered approximately million through in september  we made a million cash contribution to the teleflex retirement income plan to improve the funded status of the pension plan 
the volatility in the securities markets has not significantly affected the liquidity of our pension plans or counterparty exposure 
a majority of the assets in our domestic pension plans are invested in mutual funds registered with the sec under the investment company act of underlying holdings of the mutual funds are primarily invested in publicly traded equity and fixed income securities 
we manage our worldwide cash requirements by monitoring the funds available among our subsidiaries and determining the extent to which those funds can be accessed on a cost effective basis 
the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences  however  those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations 
we have and will continue to transfer cash from those subsidiaries to the us and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so 
we depend on foreign sources of cash to fund a portion of our debt service requirements  substantially all of which relate to united states indebtedness because the net cash provided by us based operating activities alone is not sufficient 
accordingly  we repatriated approximately million and million in and  respectively  of cash from our foreign subsidiaries to help fund debt service and other cash requirements 
these cash distributions are subject to tax in the us at the corporate tax rate reduced by applicable foreign tax credits for foreign taxes paid on distributed earnings 
approximately million of our million of net cash provided by operating activities in was generated in the us  and approximately million of our million of net cash provided by operating activities in was generated in the us 
table of contents during and we repaid approximately million and million  respectively  of debt from the proceeds of the issuance of convertible debt  the sale of businesses and from cash generated from operations 
as a result  we have no scheduled principal payments under our senior credit facility until october our next scheduled senior note principal payment is in july for approximately million 
we anticipate our domestic interest payments for will be approximately million 
to the extent we cannot  or choose not to  repatriate cash from foreign subsidiaries in time to meet quarterly debt service or other requirements  our revolving credit facility can be utilized as a source of liquidity until such cash can be repatriated in a cost effective manner 
we expect to receive approximately million in principal amount of zero coupon greek treasury bonds in settlement of amounts due us from sales to the public hospital system in greece for  and the bonds mature over a three year period 
at december  we provided an allowance of million to reflect the respective outstanding receivables at that date at the fair value of greek treasury bonds with a comparable maturity 
we believe our cash flow from operations  available cash and cash equivalents  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and sales of accounts receivable under our securitization program will enable us to fund our operating requirements  capital expenditures and debt obligations 
refinancing transactions in august  we entered into a series of refinancing transactions comprised of i a public offering of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes due the convertible notes  ii the amendment of certain terms of our senior credit facilities  iii the extension of the maturity of a portion of our borrowings under the senior credit facilities  iv the repayment of million of borrowings under the senior credit facilities  v the amendment of certain terms of our senior notes and vi the prepayment of all of our notes  which had an outstanding aggregate principal amount of million and were scheduled to mature in and the refinancing transactions were designed to improve near term liquidity and financial flexibility by extending debt maturities 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for information on the refinancing 
prepayment of notes in december  we prepaid million in aggregate principal amount of our notes 
of this amount  i million was applied to the series tranche a senior notes due  ii million was applied to the series tranche b senior notes due and iii million was applied to the series tranche c senior notes due see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for additional information on the partial prepayment of the notes 
on february   we began to prepay the remaining aggregate principal amount of the notes 
see note  subsequent events  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for additional information 

table of contents cash flows the following table provides a summary of our cash flows for the periods presented year ended december  dollars in millions cash flows from continuing operations provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities cash flows provided by discontinued operations effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash flow from operating activities comparison of and operating activities from continuing operations provided net cash of approximately million during year over year cash flow from operating activities increased million over the comparable period in cash flow from operations in was adversely affected by a million tax payment on the sale of the ati businesses  while the increase reflects a tax refund of million and lower payments for interest and restructuring and integration programs 
the increase was partly offset by a million increase in our contributions to domestic defined benefit pension plans in over the comparable period in and an increase in receivables of million that resulted from the adoption of an amendment to financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic  transfers and servicing asc topic in the first quarter of specifically  upon adoption of the amendment  the accounts receivable that we previously treated as sold and removed from the balance sheet under our securitization program are now required to be accounted for as secured borrowings and reflected as short term debt on our balance sheet 
the effect of the amendment is reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows under financing activities in the increase decrease in notes payable and current borrowings and under operating activities in the accounts receivable use of cash 
underlying these activities cash flow from continuing operations in compared to was further reduced by higher receivables primarily in europe reflecting the continued slow down in payments from public hospitals in italy  spain  portugal and greece where funding continues to be under pressure due to weak economic conditions and higher inventories in north america in advance of the coming flu season 
comparison of and lower tax payments of approximately million and lower interest payments of approximately million were the primary contributors to the higher cash flow from continuing operations in compared to changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in an aggregate decrease in cash from operations of approximately million during  which was comprised of a reduction in income taxes payable of approximately million offset by the impact from a reduction of working capital of approximately million 
the reduction in taxes includes million of taxes paid in connection with the sale of the ati businesses in the reduction in working capital results principally from i lower inventory due largely to inventory control efforts in both the aerospace and commercial segments in response to weak demand during  coupled with deliveries of cargo handling systems in the aerospace segment that had been delayed from into  ii lower accounts receivable  primarily in the aerospace segment  reflecting lower sales  partly offset by higher receivables in the medical segment due to a slow down in payments from 
table of contents public hospitals in italy  spain  portugal and greece where funding has been under pressure due to weak economic conditions 
these reductions in cash flow were partly offset by iii lower accounts payable and accrued expenses largely due to reduced spending on inventory in the aerospace segment coupled with reduced payments of termination benefits and contract termination costs in restructuring and integration reserves 
cash flow from investing activities investing activities from continuing operations provided net cash of million in  primarily due to million in proceeds from the sale of ssi  million from the sale of heavy lift and million from the sale of the actuation business  partly offset by capital expenditures of million 
our cash flows from investing activities from continuing operations in consisted primarily of proceeds from the sales of the ati businesses and power systems operations  partly offset by capital expenditures of million 
cash flow from financing activities financing activities from continuing operations used net cash of million in during the third quarter of  in connection with the refinancing of a portion of our long term debt  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of convertible notes 
as part of our effort to reduce the potential dilution resulting from the issuance of our common stock and or reduce our exposure to potential cash payments we may be required to make upon conversion of the convertible notes  we entered into hedging transactions involving the purchase of call options and the sale of warrants see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for further information 
we used approximately million of the convertible note proceeds to purchase the call options  which was partially offset by the receipt of million from the sale of the warrants 
we used million of the convertible note proceeds to repay term loan borrowings under our senior credit facility 
in connection with the refinancing transactions we incurred million of transaction fees and expenses  including underwriters discounts and commissions 
we used the remainder of the net proceeds  together with available cash  to prepay all of our outstanding notes at an aggregate prepayment purchase price equal to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of million  plus a prepayment make whole amount of million 
during the fourth quarter of we prepaid million in aggregate principal amount of our notes  which required the payment to the noteholders of a prepayment make whole amount of million 
we also paid million of dividends 
these reductions in cash flows from financing activities were partly offset by the million increase in notes payable and current borrowings as a result of the application of the amendment to asc topic  discussed above  to our securitization program  which resulted in the reporting of the securitization program as a secured borrowing in our cash flows from financing activities from continuing operations in consisted primarily of million repayment of long term debt and payment of dividends of million  partly offset by borrowings of million under our revolving credit facility 

table of contents financing arrangements the following table provides our net debt to total capital ratio dollars in millions net debt includes current borrowings long term borrowings total debt less cash and cash equivalents net debt total capital includes net debt shareholders equity total capital percent of net debt to total capital fixed rate borrowings  excluding the effect of derivative instruments  comprised of total borrowings at december  fixed rate borrowings  including the effect of derivative instruments  comprised of total borrowings at december  less than of our total borrowings of million are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the renminbi 
our senior credit and senior note agreements contain covenants that  among other things  limit or restrict our ability  and the ability of our subsidiaries  to incur debt  create liens  consolidate  merge or dispose of certain assets  make certain investments  engage in acquisitions  pay dividends on  repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock and enter into swap agreements 
these agreements also require us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than and a consolidated interest coverage ratio generally  consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense  each as defined in the senior credit agreement of not less than as of the last day of any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters calculated pursuant to the definitions and methodology set forth in the senior credit agreement 
at december   our consolidated leverage ratio was and our interest coverage ratio was  both of which are in compliance with the limits described in the preceding sentence 
at december   we had no borrowings outstanding and approximately million in outstanding standby letters of credit under our million revolving credit facility 
this facility is used principally for seasonal working capital needs 
we had no outstanding borrowings under this facility throughout until we borrowed million on december  to prepay a portion of the notes including fees and make whole premium 
we then repaid this amount from the proceeds of the sale of the actuation business on december  the availability of loans under this facility is dependent upon our ability to maintain our financial condition and our continued compliance with the covenants contained in the senior credit agreement and senior note agreements 
moreover  additional borrowings would be prohibited if a material adverse effect as defined in the senior credit agreement were to occur 
notwithstanding these restrictions  we believe that this revolving credit facility provides us with significant flexibility to meet our foreseeable working capital needs 
at our current level of ebitda as defined in the senior credit agreement for the year ended december   we would have been permitted million of additional debt beyond the levels outstanding at december  moreover  additional capacity would be available if borrowed funds were used to acquire a business or businesses through the purchase of assets or controlling equity interests so long as the aforementioned leverage and interest coverage ratios are met after calculating ebitda on a proforma basis to give effect to the acquisition 

table of contents as of december   we were in compliance with all other terms of the senior credit agreement and the senior notes  and we expect to continue to be in compliance with the terms of these agreements  including the leverage and interest coverage ratios  throughout for additional information regarding our indebtedness  please see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
in addition  we have an accounts receivable securitization facility under which we sell a security interest in domestic accounts receivable for consideration of up to million to a commercial paper conduit  as of december   the maximum amount available for borrowing was million 
this facility is utilized from time to time for increased flexibility in funding short term working capital requirements 
the agreement governing the accounts receivable securitization facility contains certain covenants and termination events 
an occurrence of an event of default or a termination event under this facility may give rise to the right of our counterparty to terminate this facility 
stock repurchase programs on june   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock 
repurchases of our stock under the board authorization may be made from time to time in the open market and may include privately negotiated transactions as market conditions warrant and subject to regulatory considerations 
the stock repurchase program has no expiration date and our ability to execute on the program will depend on  among other factors  cash requirements for acquisitions  cash generation from operations  debt repayment obligations  market conditions and regulatory requirements 
in addition  our senior loan agreements limit the aggregate amount of share repurchases and other restricted payments we may make to million per year in the event our consolidated leverage ratio exceeds to accordingly  these provisions may limit our ability to repurchase shares under this board authorization 
through december   no shares have been purchased under this board authorization 
contractual obligations contractual obligations at december  are as follows payments due by period less than more than total year years years years dollars in thousands total borrowings interest obligations operating lease obligations minimum purchase obligations other postretirement benefits total contractual obligations interest obligations include our obligations under our interest rate swap agreement 
interest payments on floating rate debt are based on the interest rate in effect on december  purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable pricing provisions and the approximate timing of the transactions 
these obligations relate primarily to material purchase requirements 
we have recorded a noncurrent liability for uncertain tax positions of million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of ongoing or future tax examinations we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount of any 
table of contents income tax payments to settle uncertain income tax positions or the periods in which any such payments will be made 
in  cash contributions to all defined benefit pension plans were million  and we estimate the amount of cash contributions will be in the range of million to million in due to the potential impact of future plan investment performance  changes in interest rates and other economic and demographic assumptions and changes in legislation in the united states and other foreign jurisdictions  we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing and amount of contributions that may be required to fund our defined benefit plans for periods beyond see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for additional information 
off balance sheet arrangements we have residual value guarantees under operating leases for certain equipment 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these guarantees is approximately million

critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates  which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts in the ordinary course of business  we grant non interest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms 
in an effort to reduce our credit risk  we i establish credit limits for all of our customer relationships  ii perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition  iii monitor the payment history and aging of our customers receivables  and iv monitor open orders against an individual customer s outstanding receivable balance 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for accounts receivable based on our historical collection experience and expected collectability of the accounts receivable  considering the period an account is outstanding  the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services 
the adequacy of this allowance is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million at december  and million at december  which was and  respectively  of gross accounts receivable 
in light of the disruptions in global economic markets that began in the fourth quarter of and has continued through we have heightened our risk assessment when estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  by engaging in a more robust customer by customer risk assessment 
although future results cannot always be predicted by extrapolating past results  management believes that it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience 
however  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if unexpected events or significant future changes in trends were to occur  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents inventory utilization inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
accordingly  we maintain a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory to reduce the carrying value of our inventories to reflect the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence  damage or other issues affecting marketability by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value 
factors utilized in the determination of estimated market value include i current sales data and historical return rates  ii estimates of future demand  iii competitive pricing pressures  iv new product introductions  v product expiration dates  and vi component and packaging obsolescence 
the adequacy of this reserve is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary 
we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities 
in assessing historical usage  we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage 
our excess and obsolete inventory reserve was million at december  and million at december  which was and of gross inventories  at those respective dates 
accounting for long lived assets and investments the ability to realize long lived assets is evaluated periodically as events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount 
such evaluation is based on various analyses  including undiscounted cash flow projections 
the analyses necessarily involve significant management judgment 
any impairment loss  if indicated  equals the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets by reporting segment at december  were as follows medical aerospace commercial total dollars in millions goodwill intangible assets indefinite lived finite lived goodwill and intangible assets number of reporting units intangible assets may represent indefinite lived assets eg  certain trademarks or brands  determinable lived intangibles eg  certain trademarks or brands  customer relationships  patents and technologies or goodwill 
of these  only the costs of determinable lived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles assets  primarily trademarks and brand names  are not amortized but are tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter  using the first day of the quarter as the measurement date  or earlier upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
such conditions may include an economic downturn in a geographic market or a change in the assessment of future operations 
our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite lived intangibles 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital  are consistent with internal projections and operating plans 
we believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants 

table of contents goodwill impairment assessments are performed at a reporting unit level 
for purposes of this assessment  the our reporting units are generally its businesses one level below the respective operating segment 
goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the process is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  with its carrying value 
in performing the first step  we calculated fair values of the various reporting units using equal weighting of two methods  one which estimates the discounted cash flows dcf of each of the reporting units based on projected earnings in the future the income approach and one which is based on sales of similar assets in actual transactions the market approach 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  there is no impairment 
if the reporting unit carrying amount exceeds the fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment 
the more significant judgments and assumptions made to determine the fair value of our reporting units were the amount and timing of expected future cash flows which are based primarily on our estimates of future sales  operating income  industry trends and the regulatory environment of the individual reporting units  the expected long term growth rates for each of our reporting units  which approximate the expected long term growth rate of the global economy and of the respective industries in which the reporting units operate  discount rates that are used to discount future cash flows to their present values  which are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units along with various market based inputs  determination of appropriate revenue and ebitda multiples used to estimate a reporting unit s fair value under the market approach and the selection of appropriate comparable companies to be used for purposes of determining those multiples 
there were no changes to the underlying methods used in the current year as compared to the prior year valuations of our reporting units 
the dcf analysis utilized in the fourth quarter impairment test was performed over a ten year time horizon for each reporting unit 
for reporting units whose assets include goodwill  the compound growth rates during this period range from approximately to for revenue and from approximately to for operating income 
discount rates were for reporting units in the medical segment and for reporting units in the aerospace and commercial segments 
a perpetual growth rate of was assumed for all reporting units 
in arriving at our estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit  we considered the results of both the dcf and the market comparable methods and concluded the fair value to be the average of the results yielded by the two methods for each reporting unit 
then  our current market capitalization was reconciled to the sum of the estimated fair values of the individual reporting units  plus a control premium  to ensure the fair value conclusions were reasonable in light of current market capitalization 
the control premium implied by our analysis was approximately  which was deemed to be within a reasonable range of observed average industry control premiums 
no impairment in the carrying value of any of our reporting units was evident as a result of the assessment of their respective fair values as determined under the methodology described above 
the fair values of our reporting units whose assets include goodwill  other than the north america reporting unit within the medical segment  exceed their respective carrying values by more than 
for the medical north america reporting unit  the fair value is approximately higher than its carrying value in  where the fair value had been and higher than its carrying value in and  respectively 
the approximately million of goodwill attributed to the medical north america reporting unit constitutes approximately of our total goodwill 
our expected future growth rates are based on our estimates of future sales  operating income and cash flow and are consistent with our internal budgets and business plans which reflect a modest amount of core revenue growth coupled with the successful launch of new products each year which  together  more than offset volume losses from products that are expected to reach the end of their life cycle 
as a result of this analysis  the compound 
table of contents annual growth rate of sales and cash flows over the projected ten year period in the medical north america reporting unit is estimated to be and  respectively 
under the income approach  significant changes in assumptions would be required for this reporting unit to fail the step one test 
for example  an increase of over one percent in the discount rate or a decrease of over percent in the compound annual growth rate of operating income would be required to indicate impairment for this reporting unit 
nevertheless  while we believe the assumed growth rates of sales and cash flows are reasonable and achievable the possibility remains that the core revenue growth of this reporting unit may not perform as expected  and  as a result  the estimated fair value may continue to decline 
if our strategy and or new products are not successful and we do not achieve core revenue growth in the future the goodwill in the medical north america reporting unit may become impaired and  in such case  we may incur material impairment charges 
intangible assets intangible assets are assets acquired that lack physical substance and that meet the specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill 
intangible assets we obtained through acquisitions are comprised mainly of technology  customer relationships  and trade names 
the fair value of acquired technology and trade names is estimated by the use of a relief from royalty method  which values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through the ownership of an asset 
under this method  an owner of an intangible asset determines the arm s length royalty that likely would have been charged if the owner had to license the asset from a third party 
the royalty  which is based on the estimated rate applied against forecasted sales  is tax effected and discounted to present value using a discount rate commensurate with the relative risk of achieving the cash flow attributable to the asset 
the fair value of acquired customer relationships is estimated by the use of an income approach known as the excess earnings method 
the excess earnings method measures economic benefit of an asset indirectly by calculating residual profit attributable to the asset after appropriate returns are paid to complementary or contributory assets 
the residual profit is tax effected and discounted to present value at an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the estimated income stream 
determining the useful life of an intangible asset requires considerable judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives 
management tests indefinite lived intangible assets on at least an annual basis  or more frequently if necessary 
in connection with the analysis  management tests for impairment by comparing the carrying value of intangible assets to their estimated fair values 
since quoted market prices are seldom available for intangible assets  we utilize present value techniques to estimate fair value 
common among such approaches is the relief from royalty methodology described above  under which management estimates the direct cash flows associated with the intangible asset 
management must estimate the hypothetical royalty rate  discount rate  and residual growth rate to estimate the forecasted cash flows associated with the asset 
discount rates and perpetual growth rates utilized in the impairment test of indefinite lived assets during the fourth quarter of are comparable to the rates utilized in the impairment test of goodwill by segment 
compound annual growth rates in revenues projected to be generated from certain trade names in the medical segment ranged from to and a royalty rate of was assumed 
the compound annual growth rate in revenues projected to be generated from certain trade names in the commercial segment was and a royalty rate of was assumed 
discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows generated as a result of the respective intangible assets 
assumptions about royalty rates are based on the rates at which similar trademarks or technologies are being licensed in the marketplace 
no impairment in the carrying value of any of our trade names was evident as a result of the assessment of their respective fair values as determined under the methodology described above  nor would impairment be evident had the fair value of each our indefinite lived assets been hypothetically lower than presently estimated by as of september  we are not required to perform an annual impairment test for long lived assets  including finite lived intangible assets eg  customer relationships  instead  long lived assets are tested for impairment upon the 
table of contents occurrence of a triggering event 
triggering events include the likely ie  more likely than not disposal of a portion of such assets or the occurrence of an adverse change in the market involving the business employing the related assets 
significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred and re assessing the reasonableness of the remaining useful lives of finite lived assets by  among other things  assessing customer attrition rates 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits we provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees  including pensions and postretirement healthcare benefits 
several statistical and other factors which are designed to project future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans 
these factors include actuarial assumptions about discount rates  expected rates of return on plan assets  compensation increases  turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates 
we review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
the weighted average assumptions for us and foreign plans used in determining net benefit cost were as follows pension other benefits discount rate rate of return initial healthcare trend rate ultimate healthcare trend rate significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense 
the following table shows the sensitivity to changes in the weighted average assumptions assumed discount expected return rate on plan assets assumed healthcare basis basis basis trend rate point point point increase decrease change increase decrease dollars in millions net periodic pension and postretirement healthcare expense projected benefit obligation n a product warranty liability we warrant to the original purchaser of certain of our products that we will  at our option  repair or replace  without charge  such products if they fail due to a manufacturing defect 
warranty periods vary by product 
we have recourse provisions for certain products that would enable recovery from third parties for amounts paid under the warranty 
we accrue for product warranties when  based on available information  it is probable that customers will make claims under warranties relating to products that have been sold  and a reasonable estimate of the costs based on historical claims experience relative to sales can be made 
our estimated product warranty liability was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
distributor rebates we offer rebates to certain distributors and accrue an estimate for the rebate as a reduction of revenues at the time of sale 
the estimate is based on an historical experience rate of rebate claims by distributors over the 
table of contents previous months for specific product lines 
the accrual for estimated rebates was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
share based compensation we estimate the fair value of share based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods 
share based compensation expense is measured using a black scholes option pricing model that takes into account highly subjective and complex assumptions with respect to expected life of options  volatility  risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield 
the expected life of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding  which is derived from the vesting period of the award  as well as historical exercise behavior 
expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility and implied volatility derived from publicly traded options to purchase our common stock  which we believe is more reflective of the market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than solely using historical volatility 
the risk free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the option 
accounting for income taxes our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess uncertainties  make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates 
we conduct a broad range of operations around the world  subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions  resulting at times in tax audits  disputes with tax authorities and potential litigation  the outcome of which is uncertain 
management must make judgments about such uncertainties and determine estimates of our tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using currently enacted tax rates  which we expect will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled 
the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income  our ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks  final us and foreign tax settlements  and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions 
while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities  which could be material 
we are also required to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
we evaluate all positive and negative evidence and use judgments regarding past and future events  including operating results and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
based on this assessment  we determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized  in which case we apply a valuation allowance to offset our deferred tax assets in an amount equal to future tax benefits that may not be realized 
to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future  adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required 
the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of million and million at december  and december   respectively  relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets  primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions 
we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax asset 
the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions under asc topic income taxes  which requires that a valuation allowance be established and maintained when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions 
we establish additional provisions for income taxes when  despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable  there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold  which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority 
in the normal 
table of contents course of business  we are examined by various federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
we adjust the income tax provision  the current tax liability and deferred taxes in any period in which facts that give rise to an adjustment become known 
specifically  we are currently in the midst of examinations by the us  canadian  german and czech republic taxing authorities with respect to our income tax returns for those countries for various tax years 
the ultimate outcomes of the examinations of these returns could result in increases or decreases to our recorded tax liabilities  which could impact our financial results 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for additional information regarding our uncertain tax positions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to certain financial risks  specifically fluctuations in market interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and  to a lesser extent  commodity prices 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of some of these risks 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes 
we are also exposed to changes in the market traded price of our common stock as it influences the valuation of stock options and their effect on earnings 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances 
an interest rate swap is used to manage a portion of our interest rate risk 
the table below provides information regarding the amortization and related interest rates by year of maturity for our fixed and variable rate debt obligations 
variable interest rates shown below are the weighted average rates of the debt portfolio based on interest rates in effect on december  for the amount subject to swap  the notional amount and the related interest rate is shown by year of maturity 
the fair value  net of tax  of the interest rate swap as of december  was a loss of million  which was reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
year of maturity thereafter total dollars in thousands fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate amount subject to swaps variable to fixed average rate to be received months usd libor average rate to be paid 
table of contents the notional value of the interest rate swap was million at inception and was amortized to a notional value of million in october the notional value of the interest rate swap will remain at million until maturity in the all in cost of the million floating rate debt swapped to a fixed rate is plus the applicable spread over libor  which at december  was basis points 
a change in variable interest rates would adversely or positively impact our expected net earnings by approximately million  for the year ended december  foreign currency risk we are exposed to currency fluctuations in connection with transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries 
we have entered into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of projected cash flows from these exposures 
these are primarily contracts to buy or sell a foreign currency against the us dollar or the euro 
the fair value of the open forward contracts as of december  was a net gain of million 
the following table provides information regarding our open forward currency contracts as of december   which mature in forward contract notional amounts presented below are expressed in the stated currencies 
the total notional amount for all contracts translates to approximately million 
forward currency contracts buy sell in thousands japanese yen united states dollars euros mexican peso czech koruna malaysian ringgits canadian dollars a strengthening of in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies would  on a combined basis  adversely impact the translation of our non us subsidiary net earnings and transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of certain subsidiaries by approximately million  for the year ended december
