item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations and the financial condition of our business during each of the fiscal years in the three year period ended december  overview we are a leading independent manufacturer and distributor of replacement parts for motor vehicles in the automotive aftermarket industry  with an increasing focus on the original equipment service market 
we are organized into two major operating segments  each of which focuses on a specific line of replacement parts 
our engine management segment manufactures ignition and emission parts  ignition wires  battery cables and fuel system parts 
our temperature control segment manufactures and remanufactures air conditioning compressors  air conditioning and heating parts  engine cooling system parts  power window accessories  and windshield washer system parts 
we sell our products primarily to warehouse distributors  large retail chains  original equipment manufacturers and original equipment service part operations in the united states  canada and latin america 
our customers consist of many of the leading warehouse distributors  such as carquest and napa auto parts  as well as many of the leading auto parts retail chains  such as advance auto parts  autozone  o reilly automotive  canadian tire and pep boys 
our customers also include national program distribution groups and specialty market distributors 
we distribute parts under our own brand names  such as standard  bwd  intermotor  four seasons  factory air  aci  imperial and hayden and through private labels  such as carquest  napa echlin  napa temp products and napa belden 
business strategy our goal is to grow revenues and earnings and deliver returns in excess of our cost of capital by providing high quality original equipment and replacement products to the engine management and temperature control markets 
the key elements of our strategy are as follows maintain our strong competitive position in the engine management and temperature control businesses 
we are one of the leading independent manufacturers serving north america and other geographic areas in our core businesses of engine management and temperature control 
we believe that our success is attributable to our emphasis on product quality  the breadth and depth of our product lines for both domestic and imported automobiles  and our reputation for outstanding customer service 
to maintain our strong competitive position in our markets  we remain committed to the following providing our customers with broad lines of high quality engine management and temperature control products  supported by the highest level of customer service and reliability  continuing to maximize our production and distribution efficiencies  continuing to improve our cost position through increased global sourcing and increased manufacturing in low cost countries  and focusing further on our engineering development efforts including a renewed focus on bringing more product manufacturing in house 
provide superior customer service  product availability and technical support 
our goal is to increase sales to existing and new customers by leveraging our skills in rapidly filling orders  maintaining high levels of product availability  providing insightful customer category management  and providing technical support in a cost effective manner 
in addition  our category management and technically skilled sales force professionals provide product selection and application support to our customers 
expand our product lines 
we intend to increase our sales by continuing to develop internally  or through potential acquisitions  the range of engine management and temperature control products that we offer to our customers 
we are committed to investing the resources necessary to maintain and expand our technical capability to manufacture multiple product lines that incorporate the latest technologies 
broaden our customer base 
our goal is to increase our customer base by a continuing to leverage our manufacturing capabilities to secure additional original equipment business with automotive  industrial  marine  military and heavy duty vehicle and equipment manufacturers and their service part operations as well as our existing customer base including traditional warehouse distributors  large retailers  other manufacturers and export customers  and b supporting the service part operations of vehicle and equipment manufacturers with value added services and product support for the life of the part 
improve operating efficiency and cost position 
our management places significant emphasis on improving our financial performance by achieving operating efficiencies and improving asset utilization  while maintaining product quality and high customer order fill rates 
we intend to continue to improve our operating efficiency and cost position by increasing cost effective vertical integration in key product lines through internal development  focusing on integrated supply chain management  maintaining and improving our cost effectiveness and competitive responsiveness to better serve our customer base  including sourcing certain products from low cost countries such as those in asia  enhancing company wide programs geared toward manufacturing and distribution efficiency  and focusing on company wide overhead and operating expense cost reduction programs  such as closing excess facilities and consolidating redundant functions 
cash utilization 
we intend to apply any excess cash flow from operations and the management of working capital primarily to reduce our outstanding indebtedness  pay dividends to our shareholders  and expand our product lines through potential acquisitions 
the automotive aftermarket the automotive aftermarket industry is comprised of a large number of diverse manufacturers varying in product specialization and size 
in addition to manufacturing  aftermarket companies allocate resources towards an efficient distribution process and product engineering in order to maintain the flexibility and responsiveness on which their customers depend 
aftermarket manufacturers must be efficient producers of small lot sizes and do not have to provide systems engineering support 
aftermarket manufacturers also must distribute  with rapid turnaround times  products for a full range of vehicles on the road 
the primary customers of the automotive aftermarket manufacturers are national and regional warehouse distributors  large retail chains  automotive repair chains and the dealer service networks of original equipment manufacturers oems 
during periods of economic decline or weakness  more automobile owners may choose to repair their current automobiles using replacement parts rather than purchasing new automobiles  which benefits the automotive aftermarket industry  including suppliers like us 
current global economic and financial market conditions have adversely affected  and may continue to adversely affect  the volume of new cars and truck sales  which could also benefit the automotive aftermarket 
seasonality 
historically  our operating results have fluctuated by quarter  with the greatest sales occurring in the second and third quarters of the year and revenues generally being recognized at the time of shipment 
it is in these quarters that demand for our products is typically the highest  specifically in the temperature control segment of our business 
in addition to this seasonality  the demand for our temperature control products during the second and third quarters of the year may vary significantly with the summer weather and customer inventories 
for example  a cool summer may lessen the demand for our temperature control products  while a hot summer may increase such demand 
as a result of this seasonality and variability in demand of our temperature control products  our working capital requirements typically peak near the end of the second quarter  as the inventory build up of air conditioning products is converted to sales and payments on the receivables associated with such sales have yet to be received 
during this period  our working capital requirements are typically funded by borrowing from our revolving credit facility 
inventory management 
we face inventory management issues as a result of warranty and overstock returns 
many of our products carry a warranty ranging from a day limited warranty to a lifetime limited warranty  which generally covers defects in materials or workmanship and failure to meet industry published specifications 
in addition to warranty returns  we also permit our customers to return products to us within customer specific limits which are generally limited to a specified percentage of their annual purchases from us in the event that they have overstocked their inventories 
we accrue for overstock returns as a percentage of sales  after giving consideration to recent returns history 
in order to better control warranty and overstock return levels  we tightened the rules for authorized warranty returns  placed further restrictions on the amounts customers can return and instituted a program so that our management can better estimate potential future product returns 
in addition  with respect to our air conditioning compressors  which are our most significant customer product warranty returns  we established procedures whereby a warranty will be voided if a customer does not provide acceptable proof that complete air conditioning system repair was performed 
discounts  allowances and incentives 
in connection with our sales activities  we offer a variety of usual customer discounts  allowances and incentives 
first  we offer cash discounts for paying invoices in accordance with the specified discount terms of the invoice 
second  we offer pricing discounts based on volume and different product lines purchased from us 
these discounts are principally in the form of off invoice discounts and are immediately deducted from sales at the time of sale 
for those customers that choose to receive a payment on a quarterly basis instead of off invoice  we accrue for such payments as the related sales are made and reduce sales accordingly 
finally  rebates and discounts are provided to customers as advertising and sales force allowances  and allowances for warranty and overstock returns are also provided 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
we account for these discounts and allowances as a reduction to revenues  and record them when sales are recorded

in november  we entered into a third amended and restated credit agreement with general electric capital corporation  as agent  and a syndicate of lenders for a secured revolving credit facility 
this restated credit agreement replaces our prior credit facility as amended through june with general electric capital corporation 
the restated credit agreement provides for a line of credit of up to million inclusive of the canadian revolving credit facility described below and expires in march direct borrowings under the restated credit agreement bear interest at the libor rate plus the applicable margin as defined  or floating at the index rate plus the applicable margin  at our option

the restated credit agreement is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and secured by certain of our assets 
borrowings under the restated credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our assets  including accounts receivable  inventory and fixed assets  and those of certain of our subsidiaries 
after taking into account outstanding borrowings under the restated credit agreement  there was an additional million available for us to borrow pursuant to the formula at december   of which million was reserved for redemption of the aggregate outstanding amount of our convertible subordinated debentures 
outstanding borrowings under the restated credit agreement inclusive of the canadian revolving credit facility described below  which are classified as current liabilities  were million and million at december  and december   respectively

at december   the weighted average interest rate on our restated credit agreement was  which consisted of million at and an index loan of million at at any time that our average borrowing availability over the previous thirty days is less than million or if our borrowing availability is million or less  and until such time that we have maintained an average borrowing availability of million or greater for a continuous period of ninety days  the terms of our restated credit agreement provide for  among other provisions  financial covenants requiring us  on a consolidated basis  to maintain specified levels of fixed charge coverage at the end of each fiscal quarter rolling twelve months  and to limit capital expenditure levels 
as of december   we were not subject to these covenants 
availability under our restated credit agreement is based on a formula of eligible accounts receivable  eligible inventory and eligible fixed assets

in may  we amended our canadian credit agreement with ge canada finance holding company  for itself and as agent for the lenders 
the amended canadian credit agreement provided for the conversion of the then existing million line of credit into a revolving credit facility 
the canadian million line of credit is part of the million available for borrowing under our restated credit agreement with general electric capital corporation 
in november  we further amended our canadian credit agreement to extend the maturity date of the agreement to march and modify certain provisions  including interest rates  to parallel the revolving credit provisions of the restated credit agreement see above 
the amended credit agreement is guaranteed and secured by us and certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
direct borrowings under the amended credit agreement bear interest at the same rate as our restated credit agreement with general electric capital corporation 
as of december   we have no outstanding borrowings under the canadian line of credit 
during  we exchanged million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding convertible subordinated debentures due for a like principal amount of newly issued convertible subordinated debentures due the newly issued convertible subordinated debentures are convertible into our common stock at the option of the holders at a conversion price of per share as opposed to the conversion price of per share offered to holders of the convertible subordinated debentures 
the impact of common shares to be issued  if converted  would be an increase from approximately  shares under the convertible subordinated debentures to approximately  shares under the newly issued convertible subordinated debentures at the aggregate principal amount of million 
the convertible subordinated debentures are subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness  and if a change in control  as defined in the agreement  occurs at the company  we will be required to make an offer to purchase the convertible subordinated debentures at a purchase price equal to of the aggregated principal amount  plus accrued interest 
we did not receive any cash proceeds from the exchange 
in addition during  we issued million aggregate principal amount of unsecured promissory notes to certain directors and executive officers and to the trustees of our supplemental executive retirement plan on behalf of the plan participants 
cash proceeds from the issuance were used to repay a portion of our revolving credit facility 
the purpose of each of these transactions was to enable us to refinance the outstanding principal amount of our then existing convertible subordinated debentures at maturity on july  with funds from our revolving credit facility 
as a result of the convertible subordinated debentures exchange and issuance of the promissory notes  we extended our short term maturity on million of debt for two years until  increased interest expense on an annualized basis by million from million to million  and enhanced our financial flexibility 
during  we prepaid the remaining outstanding principal amount of our unsecured promissory notes with funds from our revolving credit facility 
the unsecured promissory notes would have matured on april  during and  we entered into capital lease obligations related to certain equipment for use in our operations of million and million  respectively 
as of december   our remaining capital lease obligations totaled million 
assets held under capitalized leases are included in property  plant and equipment and depreciated over the lives of the respective leases or over their economic useful lives  whichever is less 
in order to reduce our accounts receivable balances and improve our cash flow  we sold undivided interests in certain of our receivables to financial institutions 
we entered these agreements at our discretion when we determined that the cost of factoring was less than the cost of servicing our receivables with existing debt 
pursuant to these agreements  we sold million and million of receivables for the years ended december  and  respectively 
under the terms of the agreements  we retain no rights or interest  have no obligations with respect to the sold receivables  and do not service the receivables after the sale 
as such  these transactions are being accounted for as a sale 
a charge in the amount of million  million and million related to the sale of receivables is included in selling  general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in november  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock and sold an additional  shares to the underwriters at the offering price of per share  less a underwriting discount 
net cash proceeds received were million  net of expenses of million 
the net proceeds from the offering were used to repay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility 
we anticipate that our present sources of funds  including funds from operations and additional borrowings  will continue to be adequate to meet our financing needs over the next twelve months 
we continue to evaluate alternative sources to further improve the liquidity of our business 
the timing  terms  size and pricing of any alternative sources of financing will depend on investor interest and market conditions  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such financing 
in addition  we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could  among other things  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  make it more difficult to satisfy our obligations  limit our ability to pay future dividends  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  and require that a portion of our cash flow from operations be used for the payment of interest on our indebtedness instead of for funding working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or for other corporate purposes 
if we default on any of our indebtedness  or breach any financial covenant in our revolving credit facility  our business could be adversely affected 
the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of december  and expiration dates of commitments through in thousands total principal payments of long term debt lease obligations postretirement benefits severance payments related to restructuring and integration total commitments critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
you should be aware that preparation of our consolidated annual and quarterly financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we can give no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue primarily from sales of replacement parts for motor vehicles from both our engine management and temperature control segments 
we recognize revenues when products are shipped and title has been transferred to a customer  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
for some of our sales of remanufactured products  we also charge our customers a deposit for the return of a used core component which we can use in our future remanufacturing activities 
such deposit is not recognized as revenue but rather carried as a core liability 
the liability is extinguished when a core is actually returned to us 
we estimate and record provisions for cash discounts  quantity rebates  sales returns and warranties in the period the sale is recorded  based upon our prior experience and current trends 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in estimating sales returns and allowances relating to revenue recognized in any accounting period 
inventory valuation 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the first in  first out basis 
where appropriate  standard cost systems are utilized for purposes of determining cost  the standards are adjusted as necessary to ensure they approximate actual costs 
estimates of lower of cost or market value of inventory are determined at the reporting unit level and are based upon the inventory at that location taken as a whole 
these estimates are based upon current economic conditions  historical sales quantities and patterns and  in some cases  the specific risk of loss on specifically identified inventories 
we also evaluate inventories on a regular basis to identify inventory on hand that may be obsolete or in excess of current and future projected market demand 
for inventory deemed to be obsolete  we provide a reserve on the full value of the inventory 
inventory that is in excess of current and projected use is reduced by an allowance to a level that approximates our estimate of future demand 
we utilize cores used parts in our remanufacturing processes for air conditioning compressors 
the production of air conditioning compressors involves the rebuilding of used cores  which we acquire generally either in outright purchases or from returns pursuant to an exchange program with customers 
under such exchange programs  we reduce our inventory  through a charge to cost of sales  when we sell a finished good compressor  and put back to inventory at standard cost through a credit to cost of sales the used core exchanged at the time it is eventually received from the customer 
sales returns and other allowances and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
at december   the allowance for sales returns was million 
similarly  we must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
at december   the allowance for doubtful accounts and for discounts was million 
new customer acquisition costs 
new customer acquisition costs refer to arrangements pursuant to which we incur change over costs to induce a new customer to switch from a competitor s brand 
in addition  change over costs include the costs related to removing the new customer s inventory and replacing it with standard motor products inventory commonly referred to as a stocklift 
new customer acquisition costs are recorded as a reduction to revenue when incurred 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be recovered  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period  we must include an expense or recovery  respectively  within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
we maintain valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred asset will not be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  we evaluate factors such as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  carryback and carryforward periods and tax strategies 
management considers all positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to realize the deferred tax asset 
we consider cumulative losses in recent years as well as the impact of one time events in assessing our core pretax earnings 
assumptions regarding future taxable income require significant judgment 
our assumptions are consistent with estimates and plans used to manage our business which includes restructuring and integration initiatives which are expected to generate significant savings in future periods 
at december   we had a valuation allowance of million  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets 
the assessment of the adequacy of our valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or we adjust these estimates in future periods for current trends or expected changes in our estimating assumptions  we may need to modify the level of valuation allowance which could materially impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices  we recognize in our financial statements only those tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold 
we establish tax reserves for uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold 
interest and penalties associated with income tax matters are included in the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statement of operations 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
at acquisition  we estimate and record the fair value of purchased intangible assets  which primarily consists of trademarks and trade names  patents and customer relationships 
the fair values of these intangible assets are estimated based on our assessment 
goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations 
goodwill and certain other intangible assets having indefinite lives are not amortized to earnings  but instead are subject to periodic testing for impairment 
intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their remaining useful lives 
we assess the impairment of long lived and identifiable intangibles assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
with respect to goodwill  we test for impairment of goodwill of a reporting unit on an annual basis or in interim periods if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review  include the following a significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  b significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and c significant negative industry or economic trends 
we review the fair values of each of our reporting units using the discounted cash flows method and market multiples 
to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  we are required to perform a second step  as this is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired 
in this step  we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
intangible and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events such as product discontinuance  plant closures  product dispositions or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in addition  identifiable intangible assets having indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis 
in reviewing for impairment  we compare the carrying value of such assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
when the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than their carrying amount  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the assets fair value and their carrying value 
there are inherent assumptions and estimates used in developing future cash flows requiring our judgment in applying these assumptions and estimates to the analysis of identifiable intangibles and long lived asset impairment including projecting revenues  interest rates  tax rates and the cost of capital 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside our control and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates will change in future periods 
these changes can result in future impairments 
in the event our planning assumptions were modified resulting in impairment to our assets  we would be required to include an expense in our statement of operations  which could materially impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
retirement and postretirement medical benefits 
each year  we calculate the costs of providing retiree benefits under the provisions of accounting standards codification  nonretirement postemployment benefits and accounting standards codification  retirement benefits 
the determination of defined benefit pension and postretirement plan obligations and their associated costs requires the use of actuarial computations to estimate participant plan benefits the employees will be entitled to 
the key assumptions used in making these calculations are the eligibility criteria of participants  the discount rate used to value the future obligation  and expected return on plan assets 
the discount rate reflects the yields available on high quality  fixed rate debt securities 
the expected return on assets is based on our current review of the long term returns on assets held by the plans  which is influenced by historical averages 
share based compensation 
accounting standards codification stock compensation  requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values on the grant date using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods in our condensed consolidated statement of operations 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on historical trends in order to estimate the amount of share based awards that will ultimately vest 
we monitor actual forfeitures for any subsequent adjustment to forfeiture rates to reflect actual forfeitures 
environmental reserves 
we are subject to various us federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations and are involved in certain environmental remediation efforts 
we estimate and accrue our liabilities resulting from such matters based upon a variety of factors including the assessments of environmental engineers and consultants who provide estimates of potential liabilities and remediation costs 
such estimates are not discounted to reflect the time value of money due to the uncertainty in estimating the timing of the expenditures  which may extend over several years 
potential recoveries from insurers or other third parties of environmental remediation liabilities are recognized independently from the recorded liability  and any asset related to the recovery will be recognized only when the realization of the claim for recovery is deemed probable 
asbestos reserve 
we are responsible for certain future liabilities relating to alleged exposure to asbestos containing products 
in accordance with our accounting policy  our most recent actuarial study as of august  estimated an undiscounted liability for settlement payments  excluding legal costs and any potential recovery from insurance carriers  ranging from million to million for the period through as a result  in september an incremental million provision in our discontinued operation was added to the asbestos accrual increasing the reserve to approximately million as of that date 
based on the information contained in the actuarial study and all other available information considered by us  we concluded that no amount within the range of settlement payments was more likely than any other and  therefore  recorded the low end of the range as the liability associated with future settlement payments through in our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  according to the updated study  legal costs  which are expensed as incurred and reported in earnings loss from discontinued operation  are estimated to range from million to million during the same period 
we will continue to perform an annual actuarial analysis during the third quarter of each year for the foreseeable future 
based on this analysis and all other available information  we will continue to reassess the recorded liability and  if deemed necessary  record an adjustment to the reserve  which will be reflected as a loss or gain from discontinued operation 
the aforementioned estimated settlement payments and legal costs do not reflect any limited coverage that we may obtain pursuant to agreements with insurance carriers for certain asbestos related claims 
other loss reserves 
we have other loss exposures  for such matters as product liability and litigation 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment of risk exposure and ultimate liability 
we estimate losses using consistent and appropriate methods  however  changes to our assumptions could materially affect our recorded liabilities for loss 
recently issued accounting pronouncements fair value measurements on january   we adopted certain provisions of a new accounting standard which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
on january   we adopted the remaining provisions of this accounting standard as it relates to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis 
the adoption of this standard as it related to certain non financial assets and liabilities did not impact our consolidated financial statements in any material respect 
on june   we adopted the accounting pronouncement issued in april that provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with the accounting standard for fair value measurements when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability has significantly decreased 
this pronouncement stated that when quoted market prices may not be determinative of fair value  a reporting entity shall consider the reasonableness of a range of fair value estimates 
the adoption of this standard as it related to inactive markets did not impact our consolidated financial statements in any material respect 
on march   we adopted accounting standards update asu  improving disclosures about fair value measurements that requires companies to enhance the usefulness of fair value measurements by requiring both the disaggregation of information in certain existing disclosures  as well as the inclusion of more robust disclosures about valuation techniques and inputs to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
the adoption of this standard will impact how we disclose in the future any material transfers into and out of level measurements based on quoted prices in active markets and level inputs measurements based on other observable inputs of the fair value hierarchy 
there were no such transfers in revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables in october  the fasb issued asu  which will update accounting standard codification asc  revenue recognition  and changes the accounting for certain revenue arrangements 
the new standard sets forth requirements that must be met for an entity to recognize revenue from the sale of a delivered item that is part of a multiple element arrangement when other items have not yet been delivered and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable to be based on the relative selling price 
asu is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in the fiscal years beginning on or after june   which for us is january  the adoption of these provisions did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  primarily related to foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
these exposures are actively monitored by management 
our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk is due to certain costs  revenues and borrowings being denominated in currencies other than one of our subsidiary s functional currency 
similarly  we are exposed to market risk as the result of changes in interest rates which may affect the cost of our financing 
it is our policy and practice to use derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposures 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
exchange rate risk we have exchange rate exposure primarily with respect to the canadian dollar  the british pound  the euro  the polish zloty  the mexican peso and the hong kong dollar 
as of december   our monetary assets and liabilities which are subject to this exposure are immaterial  therefore  the potential immediate loss to us that would result from a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows 
this sensitivity analysis assumes an unfavorable fluctuation in the exchange rates affecting the foreign currencies in which monetary assets and liabilities are denominated and does not take into account the offsetting effect of such a change on our foreign currency denominated revenues 
interest rate risk we manage our exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt in our debt portfolio 
to manage a portion of our exposure to interest rate changes  we have in the past entered into interest rate swap agreements 
at december   we had approximately million in loans and financing outstanding  of which approximately million bear interest at fixed interest rates and approximately million bear interest at variable rates of interest 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments 
our percentage of variable rate debt to total debt was and at december  and  respectively 
depending upon the level of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our excess cash  the effect of a hypothetical  instantaneous and unfavorable change of basis points in the interest rate may have an approximate million negative impact on our earnings or cash flows
