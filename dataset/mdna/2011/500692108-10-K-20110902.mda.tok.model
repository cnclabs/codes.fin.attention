table of contents part i item business 
general as used herein  the term company means koss corporation and its consolidated wholly owned subsidiary  koss classics ltd 
koss classics  unless the context otherwise requires 
the company was incorporated in delaware in the company operates in the audio video industry segment of the home entertainment industry through its design  manufacture and sale of stereo headphones and related accessory products 
the company reports its results as a single reporting segment  as the company s principal business line is the design  manufacture and sale of stereo headphones and related accessories 
the company s products are sold through national retailers  international distributors  audio specialty stores  the internet  direct mail catalogs  regional department store chains  discount department stores  military exchanges and prisons under the koss name 
the company also sells products to distributors for resale to school systems  and directly to other manufacturers for inclusion with their own products 
the company has more than domestic dealers and its products are carried in approximately  domestic retail outlets and numerous retailers worldwide 
international markets are served by domestic sales representatives and a sales office in switzerland which utilizes independent distributors in several foreign countries 
the company has one subsidiary  koss classics 
ninety nine percent of the company s products are stereo headphones for listening to music 
the products are not significantly differentiated by their retail sales channel or application with the exception of products sold to school systems and prisons 
there are no other product line differentiations other than the quality of the sound produced by the stereo headphone itself  which is highly subjective 
the business could also be classified by distribution channel 
the company sources complete stereo headphones manufactured to its specifications from various manufacturers in asia as well as raw materials used to produce stereo headphones at its plant in milwaukee  wisconsin 
management believes that it has sources of complete stereo headphones and raw materials that are adequate for its needs 
there are no employment or compensation commitments between the company and its dealers 
the company has several independent manufacturers representatives as part of its distribution efforts 
the company typically signs one year contracts with these manufacturers representatives 
the arrangements with foreign distributors do not contemplate that the company pays any compensation other than any profit the distributors make upon their sale of the company s products 
intellectual property john c 
koss is recognized for creating the stereo headphone industry with the first sp stereo headphone in the company regularly applies for registration of its trademarks in many countries around the world  and over the years the company has had numerous trademarks registered and patents issued in north america  south america  asia  europe  africa  and australia 
the company currently has approximately trademarks registered in countries around the world and patents in countries 
the company has trademarks to protect the brand name  koss  and its logo on its products 
these trademarks are maintained throughout the countries in which the company sells its products 
the company also holds many design patents that protect the unique visual appearance of some of its products 
these trademarks and patents are important to differentiate the company from its competitors 
certain of the company s trademarks are of material value and importance to the conduct of its business 
the company considers protection of its proprietary developments important  however  the company s business is not  in the opinion of management  materially dependent upon any single trademark or 
table of contents patent 
during the year ended june   the company took steps to update and monitor its patents and trademarks to protect its intellectual property around the world 
seasonality although retail sales of consumer electronics have typically been higher during the holiday season  stereo headphones have also seen increased interest as gift items over the years 
management of the company believes that its business and industry segment are no longer seasonal as evidenced by the fact that of net sales occurred in the first six months of the year ended june   and of net sales occurred in the latter six months of the year 
management believes that the reason for this level performance of sales to retailers and distributors is related to the fact that stereo headphones have become replacement items for portable electronic products 
therefore  upgrades and replacements appear to have as much interest over the course of the year as gifts of stereo headphones during the holiday season 
working capital and backlog the company s working capital needs do not differ substantially from those of its competitors in the industry and generally reflect the need to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet delivery requirements of its customers 
from time to time  although rarely  the company may extend payment terms to its dealers for a special promotion 
for instance  the company has in the past offered a day payment period for certain customers  such as computer retailers and office supply stores 
based on historical trends  management does not expect these practices to have any material effect on net sales or net income 
the company s backlog of orders as of june  is not significant in relation to net sales during fiscal or anticipated fiscal net sales 
customers the company markets a line of products used by consumers to listen to music  dvd s in vehicles  sound bytes on computer systems  and other audio related media 
the company distributes these products through retail channels in the us and independent distributors throughout the rest of the world 
the company markets its products to approximately  domestic retailers and numerous retailers worldwide 
during fiscal  the company s sales to its largest single customer  tura scandinavia ab  were approximately of net sales and sales to wal mart stores  inc accounted for of fiscal net sales 
in fiscal  net sales to tura scandinavia ab and wal mart stores  inc  accounted for and of net sales  respectively 
the company is dependent upon its ability to retain a base of retailers and distributors to sell the company s line of products 
loss of retailers and distributors means loss of product placement 
the company has broad distribution across many channels including specialty stores  mass merchants  and electronics stores 
management believes that any loss of revenues would be partially offset by a corresponding decrease  on a percentage basis  in expenses  thereby partially reducing the impact on the company s income from operations 
the five largest customers of the company including tura scandinavia ab and wal mart stores  inc accounted for approximately and of total net sales in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
competition the company focuses on the stereo headphone industry 
in the stereo headphone market  the company competes directly with approximately five major competitors  several of which are large and diversified and have greater total assets and resources than the company 
the extent to which retailers and consumers view the company as an innovative vendor of high quality stereo headphone products  and a provider of excellent after sales customer service  is the extent to which the company maintains a competitive advantage 
the company relies upon its unique sound  quality workmanship  brand identification  engineering skills  and customer service to maintain its competitive position 

table of contents research and development the amount expensed on engineering and research activities relating to the development of new products or the improvement of existing products was approximately  during fiscal as compared with  during fiscal these activities were conducted by both company personnel and outside consultants 
the company expects that research and development costs will continue and it is planning to introduce a new product offering during the first half of fiscal environmental matters the company believes that it has materially complied with all currently existing federal  state and local statutes and regulations regarding environmental standards and occupational safety and health matters to which it is subject 
during the fiscal years and  the amounts incurred in complying with federal  state and local statutes and regulations pertaining to environmental standards and occupational safety and health laws and regulations did not materially affect the company s operating results or financial condition 
employees as of june   the company employed people  who are all non union 
the company also engages temporary personnel 
foreign sales the company s competitive position and risks relating to its business in foreign markets are comparable to those in the domestic market 
in addition  the governments of foreign nations may elect to erect trade barriers on imports 
the creation of additional barriers would reduce the company s net sales and net income 
in addition  any fluctuations in currency exchange rates could affect the pricing of the company s products and divert customers who might choose to purchase lower priced  less profitable products  and could affect overall demand for the company s products 
for further information  see part ii  item and note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has a small sales office in switzerland to service the international export marketplace 
the company is not aware of any material risks in maintaining this operation 
loss of this office would result in a transfer of sales and marketing responsibility 
the company sells its products to independent distributors in countries and regions outside the united states including europe  the middle east  africa  asia  south america  latin america  the caribbean  canada and mexico 
the company sells products in the canadian market through a distributor who services smaller specialty accounts 
during the last two fiscal years  net sales of all koss products  were distributed as follows united states europe all other countries net sales in addition to a manufacturing facility in milwaukee  wisconsin  the company uses contract manufacturing facilities in the people s republic of china  taiwan and south korea 
these independent suppliers are distant from the company  which means that we are at risk of business interruptions due to natural disasters  war  disease and government intervention through tariffs or trade restrictions that are of less concern domestically 
the company maintains finished goods inventory in its us facility to mitigate this risk 
the company s goal is to stock finished goods inventory at an average of approximately days demand per item 
recovery of a single facility through replacement of a supplier in the event of a disaster or suspension of supply could take days 
the company believes that it could restore production of its top ten selling models which represent approximately of the company s net sales within one year 
the company is also at risk if the trade 
table of contents restrictions are introduced on its products based upon country of origin 
in addition  the company may not be able to pass along most increases in tariffs and freight charges to the company s customers  which would directly affect profits

item a 
risk factors 
investing in the company s common stock involves a high degree of risk 
any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  liquidity and results of operations or prospects  financial or otherwise 
reduction in present levels of cash flow could adversely affect the company s business the company s primary source of liquidity over the past months has been operating cash flows 
the company s future cash flows from operations on both a short term and long term basis are dependent upon  but not limited to the company s ability to attract new customers that will sell the company s products and pay for them  the company s ability to retain the company s existing customers at the level of sales previously produced  the volume of sales for these customers  the loss of business of one or more primary customers  changes in types of products that the customers purchase in their sales mix  poor or deteriorating economic conditions which would directly impact the ability of the company s customers to remain in business and pay for their products on a timely basis  management s ability to minimize the impact of requests for increases in material or labor cost  and the ability to collect in full and in a timely manner amounts due to the company 
in addition  the company s cash flow is also dependent  to some extent  upon the ability to maintain operating margins 
the continuing general downturn in economic conditions or other events that management believes may have caused the company s customers to turn to lower priced  lower margin products  could cause the company s cash flow and profitability to be materially and adversely affected 
failure to attract and retain customers to sell the company s products could adversely affect sales volume and future profitability the company markets a line of products used by consumers to listen to music 
the company distributes these products through retail channels in the us and independent distributors throughout the rest of the world 
the company is dependent upon its ability to attract and retain a base of customers to sell the company s line of products 
the company has broad distribution across many channels including specialty stores  mass merchants  electronics stores and computer retailers 
the company may not be able to maintain customers or model selections and therefore may experience a reduction in its sales revenue until a model is restored to the mix or a lost customer is replaced by a new customer 
the loss of business of one or more principal customers or a change in the sales volume from a particular customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s sales volume and profitability 

table of contents shift in customer specifications to lower priced items can reduce profit margins negatively impacting profitability the company sells a line of products with a suggested retail price ranging from less than up to  the gross margin for each of these models is unique in terms of percentages 
the company finds the low priced portion of the market most competitive and therefore most subject to pressure on gross margin percentages  which tends to lower profit contributions 
the risk is that a shift in retail customer specifications toward lower priced items can lead to lower gross margins and lower profit contributions per unit of sale 
due to the range of products that the company sells  the product sales mix can produce a variation in profit margins 
some customers sell a limited range of products that yield lower profit margins than others 
most notably  the budget priced stereo headphone segment of the market below retail  which is distributed through computer stores  office supply stores and mass market retailers  tends to yield the lowest gross margins 
an increase in business with these types of accounts  if coupled with a simultaneous reduction in sales to customers with higher gross margins  would reduce profit margins and profitability 
poor economic conditions can restrict or limit product placement  sales and replenishment which could decrease profits deteriorating or weak economic conditions  or a forecast for the same  can trigger changes in inventory stocking at retail customers 
this may in turn lead to a reduction in model offerings and or out of stock situations 
if a retail customer of the company does not have adequate supply of the company s products to offer for sale in a retail store  consumers may choose another competitive model instead 
customers operating retail stores anticipate future sales demands and stock inventory accordingly 
decreases in customer stocking levels or reorder quantities directly impact the company s sales and profitability 
the company is not in a position to determine how it will be affected by these circumstances  how extensive the effects may be  or for how long the company may be negatively impacted by these circumstances 
any adverse changes in economic conditions can therefore restrict product placement  availability  sales  replenishment and ultimately profitability 
these conditions exist domestically and internationally 
management is subject to decisions made outside its control which could directly affect future profitability retail customers determine which products they will stock for resale 
the company competes with other manufacturers to secure shelf space in retail stores for the company s products 
during the course of a year  changes in the customers management personnel can ultimately lead to changes in the stock assortment offered to consumers 
these changes are often arbitrary 
in addition to changes in personnel within the company s customers  it is also possible that a strategic decision can be made by a retail customer to consolidate vendors  or to discontinue certain product categories altogether 
in these instances  the company s management team may not be able to convince customers to reverse such decisions 
the company s management team is also engaged in the effective procurement  assembly and manufacture of products 
the ability to negotiate with suppliers  maintain productivity and hold the line on cost increases can be subjected to pressures outside the control of management 
for example  increases in fuel costs can increase freight rates 
increases of this nature can seldom be avoided and the company may not be able to pass such increases along to its customers 
management s effective control of the manufacturing processes will have a direct impact on the company s future profitability 
the company regularly makes decisions that affect production schedules  shipping schedules  employee headcount and inventory levels 
the company s ability to make effective decisions in managing these areas has a direct effect on future profitability 

table of contents accounts receivable amounts due from our customers can be lost as a result of customer bankruptcy  operational difficulty  or failure to pay  negatively impacting future profitability the company has significant accounts receivable from the company s customers 
terms of payment for customers generally range from cash in advance of delivery to net day credit terms 
these credit arrangements are negotiated at unspecified and irregular intervals 
the largest customers generate the largest receivable balances 
if a customer develops operational difficulty it is not uncommon to temporarily suspend payment to vendors 
the company is subject to this risk in the retail marketplace 
from time to time a customer may develop severe operating losses which can lead to a bankruptcy 
in these cases  the company may lose most or even all of the outstanding balance due 
moreover  when this occurs  another material risk may be the loss of future revenue from the bankrupt customer if it is not replaced 
in addition  many companies that insure accounts receivables may not provide adequate coverage at acceptable rates for the company s largest mass market customers 
the risk is that the company derives most of the company s sales revenue and profits from selling products to retailers for resale to consumers 
the failure of the company s customers to pay in full amounts due to the company could negatively affect future profitability 
company profits can suffer from interruptions in supply chain the company uses contract manufacturing facilities in the people s republic of china  taiwan and south korea 
the company is at risk of business interruptions due to natural disaster  war  disease and government intervention through tariffs or trade restrictions that are of less concern domestically 
therefore  if there are any interruptions in the supply chain for any of these reasons  this could directly impact the company s profits in a negative way 
the company is also at risk if trade restrictions are imposed on the company s products based upon country of origin 
in addition  the company may not be able to pass along most increases in tariffs and freight charges to the company s customers  which would directly affect profits 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could affect pricing of products and cause customers to purchase lower priced  less profitable products and could affect overall demand for the company s products the company receives a material portion of its sales and profits from business in europe 
to the extent that the value of the us dollar increases relative to currencies in those jurisdictions  it increases the cost of the company s products in those jurisdictions  which could create negative pressure on the overall demand for the company s products 
the company gets paid by its international customers in us dollars 
to the extent that increased prices arising from currency fluctuations decrease the overall demand for the company s products or motivate customers to purchase lower priced  lower profit products  the company s sales  profits and cash flows could be adversely affected 
company profits can suffer from increasing manufacturing costs in china as a result of increased wages and wage taxes the company uses contract manufacturing facilities in the people s republic of china 
an increase in the cost of labor or taxes on wages in china may lead to an increase in the cost of goods manufactured in china 
the costs of labor and wage taxes have increased in china which means that the company is at risk of higher manufacturing costs associated with goods manufactured in china 
significant increases in wages or wage taxes paid by contract manufacturing facilities may increase the cost of goods manufactured in china which could have a material adverse effect on the company s profit margins and profitability 

table of contents the company uses third party carriers to ship its products which may pass on increases in transportation related fuel costs to the company which can reduce profit margins negatively impacting profitability the company uses numerous third party carriers to ship product  both domestically and internationally 
if the price of fuel increases and the carriers choose to pass on the increase to the company  freight costs may increase 
as a result  the company s freight cost is impacted by changes in fuel prices 
fuel prices affect freight costs to both customer s location and the company s distribution center 
increases in fuel prices and surcharges and other factors have increased and may continue to increase freight costs in the future 
the inflationary pressure of higher fuel costs and continued increase in transportation related costs could have a material adverse effect on the company s profit margins and profitability 
consistency of the company s business with several large customers the company is particularly concerned about the consistency of business with several us retailers and foreign distributors 
the tightening of credit availability worldwide caused all retailers and distributors to sharply curtail inventory levels 
in addition  many retailers have been negatively impacted by the economic recession 
the company has experienced some consolidation in product lines and item elimination at several big box retailers 
the company s stock price may fluctuate as a result of uncertainties about certain business factors 
the company s common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to certain business factors such as the following the sale or availability for sale of substantial amounts of the company s common stock  actual or anticipated fluctuations in the company s operating results or its competitors operating results  announcements by the company or its competitors of new products  capacity changes  significant contracts  acquisitions or strategic investments  the company s growth rate and its competitors growth rates  changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding the company  its competitors or the industry in general  or lack of analyst coverage of the company s common stock  sales of the company s common stock by its executive officers  directors and significant stockholders or sales of substantial amounts of common stock  and changes in accounting principles 
the company is currently unable to assess the amounts that may be recovered through the proceeds from the sale of items seized by law enforcement  insurance  potential claims against third parties or tax refunds 
the company has estimated that the amount of the unauthorized transactions is approximately  since fiscal year through december  as described in the company s form k a for june  that was filed on june  over  items were seized by law enforcement authorities 
although the company expects to receive some proceeds from the sale of these items seized by law enforcement authorities  and is currently pursuing potential claims against third parties and tax refunds  the company cannot reasonably assess the amounts or timing of such recoveries 
through the date of issuance of this k  the company has received  from its insurance company related to the unauthorized transactions 
the company s inability to recover a significant amount of its losses may have an adverse effect on its future financial condition 

table of contents legal proceedings related to the unauthorized transactions may adversely affect the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
as further described in item legal proceedings  the company is currently addressing several legal matters related to the unauthorized transactions 
the company is unable at this time to quantify its exposure  if any 
the costs of dealing with these matters and any penalties and awards that may be assessed against the company could be substantial and may adversely affect the company s future results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
the company s internal control over financial reporting failed to timely detect and prevent the unauthorized transactions and it is possible that we have not implemented effective remedial measures 
the company s internal controls as of june  were not effective in that they failed to timely detect and prevent the circumvention of the internal controls and procedures relating to the unauthorized transactions 
the company has implemented remedial measures and is in the process of implementing a new computer system with an expected completion during the quarter ended september  management believes it has implemented adequate remedial measures to address the control issues identified  but a sufficient amount of time has not elapsed to fully implement the new computer system and permit testing of the overall controls to confirm their effectiveness 
thus  there is no assurance that these deficiencies have been adequately addressed or that the company has discovered all of the deficiencies that may exist in the internal controls over financial reporting 
the restatement of the company s consolidated financial statements has subjected the company to increased costs for accounting and legal fees 
the company issued restated consolidated financial statements in the annual report on form k a for june  that was filed on june  this restatement was due to errors in previously issued financial statements caused by the unauthorized transactions 
this restatement has subjected the company to significant costs in the form of accounting  legal and similar professional fees  in addition to the substantial diversion of time and attention of the company s chief financial officer and members of its accounting department in preparing the restatement 
although the restatement is complete  no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional costs associated with the restatement

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to doubtful accounts  product returns  excess inventories  warranties  impairment of long lived assets  deferred compensation  income taxes and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 

table of contents revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
when these criteria are generally satisfied  the company recognizes revenue 
the company also offers certain customers the right to return products that do not meet the standards agreed with the customer 
the company continuously monitors such product returns and cannot guarantee that they will continue to experience the same return rates that they have experienced in the past 
any significant increase in product quality failure rates and the resulting credit returns could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize 
the company provides for certain sales incentives 
the company records a provision for estimated incentives based upon the incentives offered to customers on product related sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
the provision is recorded as a reduction of sales 
the company also records a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product related sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the historical data the company uses to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  adjustments may be required in future periods 
accounts receivable the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by the review of the customer s current credit information 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon the company s historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
accounts receivable are stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance is calculated based upon the company s evaluation of specific customer accounts where the company has information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations 
in these cases  the company uses its judgment  based on the best available facts and circumstances and records a specific reserve for that customer against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount that is expected to be collected 
these specific reserves are re evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved 
however  the ultimate collectability of the unsecured receivable is dependent upon the financial condition of an individual customer  which could change rapidly and without warning 
inventories the company values its inventories at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the last in  first out lifo method 
as of june   of the company s inventory was valued using lifo 
valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market requires the use of estimates and judgment 
the company continues to use the same techniques to value inventory as have been used in the past 
our customers may cancel their orders or change purchase volumes 
this  or certain additional actions  could create excess inventory levels  which would impact the valuation of our inventories 
any actions taken by our customers that could impact the value of our inventory are considered when determining the lower of cost or market valuations 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage and production requirements 
if the company is not able to achieve its expectations of the net realizable value of the inventory at its current value  the company would have to adjust its reserves accordingly 

table of contents product software development costs product software development costs consist of costs incurred by outside parties for the development of software used to support new products 
these assets have been evaluated to ensure that the capitalized costs do not exceed the estimated net realizable value of the related products 
as part of the impairment analysis  we use an undiscounted cash flow model based on estimated sales to be derived in the future use of the asset and other estimated costs directly related to the product 
no amortization was recorded in fiscal or as the new products have not been introduced 
the company expects the new offering to be introduced during fiscal year inherent in the operating results forecasts are certain assumptions regarding revenue growth rates  projected future costs  costs to complete and projected long term growth rates 
the company performed impairment testing as of june  and and no impairment was identified 
product warranty obligations products sold are generally covered by a lifetime warranty 
we record accruals for potential warranty claims based on prior product returns experience 
warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized 
these warranty costs are based upon management s assessment of past claims and current experience 
however  actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated  as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation as a result of many factors that cannot be predicted with certainty 
income taxes we estimate a provision for income taxes based on the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year 
if the actual results are different from these estimates  adjustments to the effective tax rate may be required in the period such determination is made 
additionally  discrete items are treated separately from the effective rate analysis and are recorded separately as an income tax provision or benefit at the time they are recognized 
deferred income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method whereby deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory tax rates 
deferred income tax provisions are based on changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities from period to period 
additionally  we analyze our ability to recognize the net deferred income tax assets created in each jurisdiction in which we operate to determine if valuation allowances are necessary based on the more likely than not criteria
