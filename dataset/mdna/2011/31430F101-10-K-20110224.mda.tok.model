d a more detailed description and computation of adjusted ffo per share and adjusted ebitda is contained in the non gaap financial measures section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations following the end of the recent recession  business and leisure travel increased as the us economy strengthened and consumer confidence and spending improved 
at the same time  new hotel construction activity slowed substantially in to levels not seen since the early s 
improved demand  combined with the slowdown in lodging supply growth  is driving a demand driven industry recovery 
our hotels began seeing improved occupancy in late  which continued throughout occupancy at our hotels improved in  compared to following improved demand  as a recovery continues  the industry usually experiences improved pricing power 
as lodging demand continued to improve in  our hotels began remixing our customers to obtain higher average daily rates  or adr 
we started seeing sustained adr improvement late in the second quarter of  and this trend continued through the third and fourth quarters 
in the fourth quarter  our adr improved  and for the year we limited the decline to  compared to our consolidated hotels occupancy and adr growth during drove three quarters of improved revenue per available room  or revpar in our revpar improved in  compared to as our adr continues improving  hotel ebitda margin and operating cash flow continue to grow 
in  our consolidated hotels improved hotel ebitda margin by basis points compared to in  we undertook several critical steps as a part of our long term strategic plan in june  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock at per share 
the net proceeds from the offering  after underwriting discounts and commissions  were approximately million 
we used these proceeds  together with cash on hand  to repay million of secured debt for million  representing a discount  and for our million acquisition of the fairmont copley plaza in boston 
in may  we obtained a new million loan  secured by nine hotels  that matures in this loan bears interest at libor subject to a floor plus 
the proceeds were used to repay million in loans that were secured by hotels and scheduled to mature in may the terms and interest rate of this financing are significantly more favorable than the refinanced debt  and we unencumbered two previously mortgaged hotels in the process 
two loans totaling million matured in may the cash flows for the hotels that secured those loans did not cover debt service and we determined the hotels fair values to be less than the loan amounts 
we stopped funding the shortfalls in december we were unable to negotiate an acceptable debt modification or reduction that favored our stockholders  and we transferred these hotels to the lenders in full satisfaction of the related debt 
selling underperforming and non strategic hotels creates capacity  allows us to reduce concentration risk  reduce leverage  invest in higher yielding redevelopment opportunities at our remaining hotels and or acquire hotels in our target markets 
in addition  selling non strategic hotels reduces our future capital expenditure requirements and enables management to focus on core long term investments 
as part of our long term strategic plan to enhance shareholder value and achieve or exceed targeted returns on invested capital  we sell and acquire hotels to improve our overall portfolio quality  enhance diversification and improve growth rates 
in that regard  we reviewed each hotel in our portfolio in terms of projected performance  future capital expenditure requirements and market dynamics and concentration risk 
based on this analysis  we developed a plan to sell our interests in hotels of which we consolidate the real estate interest and six of which are owned by unconsolidated joint ventures that no longer meet our investment criteria 
as a consequence  the hold periods for the hotels we consolidate were shortened  and we were required to test those assets for impairment as they were approved to be marketed for sale 
we recorded a million impairment charge in related to of these hotels 
we will bring these hotels to market at the appropriate time and will only sell hotels when we receive satisfactory pricing 
in january  we reinstated our current quarterly preferred dividend and paid current quarterly preferred dividends of million 
we cannot pay any common dividends unless and until all accrued and current preferred dividends are paid 
our board of directors will determine whether and when to declare future dividends including the accrued but unpaid preferred dividends based upon various factors  including operating results  economic conditions  other operating trends  our financial condition and capital requirements  as well as minimum reit distribution requirements 
financial comparison in millions  except revpar  hotel ebitda margin and percentage change year ended december  change change revpar hotel ebitda a hotel ebitda margin a loss from continuing operations b a hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin are non gaap financial measures 
a discussion of the use  limitations and importance of these non gaap financial measures and detailed reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measure are found elsewhere in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the section non gaap financial measures 
b the following amounts are included in loss from continuing operations in millions year ended december  impairment loss impairment loss on unconsolidated hotels hurricane loss conversion costs severance costs debt extinguishment gain loss on sale of assets gain on involuntary conversion results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and for the year ended december   we recorded a million net loss attributable to common stockholders compared to a million loss in our loss included million of impairment charges million in continuing operations and million in discontinued operations partially offset by million of gains from extinguishment of debt million in continuing operations and million in discontinued operations  and a million gain related to the sale of our equity interest in an unconsolidated joint venture included in equity in income from unconsolidated entities 
our loss included a million impairment charge and a  gain from disposition both in discontinued operations  as well as a million loss from debt extinguishment in continuing operations 
in total revenue was million  a increase compared to the increase in revenue is attributed principally to a increase in same store revpar  which was driven by a increase in occupancy partially offset by a decrease in adr 
the fairmont copley plaza  which we acquired in august  contributed million 
hotel departmental expenses increased million compared to  reflecting improved occupancy and million of expenses at the fairmont copley plaza 
as a percentage of total revenue  hotel departmental expenses increased from to compared to cost reductions implemented during continued to provide savings throughout  which helped us achieve a reduction in per occupied room costs compared to however  decreases in revenue per occupied room predominately from lower adr more than offset the cost reductions 
typically in a lodging recovery occupancy recovers sooner than adr  so operating expenses increase without the benefit of an increase in adr 
other property related costs increased million  reflecting improved occupancy and million of costs from the hotel acquired in august as a percentage of total revenue  other property related costs remained essentially unchanged  compared to management and franchise fees increased million  compared to  due to higher revenues which serve as the basis for determining such fees and  of such fees at the fairmont copley plaza 
as a percent of total revenue  management and franchise fees remained essentially unchanged  compared to taxes  insurance and lease expenses increased million compared to the fairmont copley plaza added million of taxes  insurance and lease expense in  and same store hotels remained essentially unchanged  compared to as a percentage of total revenue  taxes  insurance and lease expense improved from in to 
favorable resolution of property tax appeals in and changes in franchise tax filing status combined to offset increases in percentage rent expenses 
corporate expenses increased million and increased as a percentage of total revenue from to 
this increase primarily reflects a temporary change in our long term compensation program and increased corporate bonus accruals 
because of the impact of the recession on the trading price of our common stock  our board of directors determined that issuing restricted stock at exceptionally low trading prices would be unduly dilutive to our stockholders 
in lieu of issuing restricted stock  restricted cash with which grantees could and did purchase stock  was granted 
because those grants were subject to payroll tax withholding  amounts withheld were recognized as an expense in the first quarter of  rather than expensed over the normal three year vesting period 
the increase in bonus expense is attributed to a higher bonus earned  based on the actual performance and the structure of our incentive compensation plan  compared to depreciation and amortization expense increased million  compared to  primarily attributable to depreciation of million and million on consolidated hotel capital assets placed in service in and  respectively 
impairment charge 
we recorded a million impairment loss in continuing operations in when we decided to sell our interest in hotels we consolidate the related real estate and shortened the hold period 
sixteen of these hotels were impaired in light of the reduced estimated hold periods 
net interest expense increased million compared to  largely attributable to our senior notes  which were issued in october these notes bear interest at a higher rate than the notes they refinanced 
debt extinguishment 
we repaid million of secured debt for million and recorded a corresponding million gain on extinguishment of debt 
this gain was partially offset by losses from retirement of million of our senior notes due june in  we retired million of senior notes maturing in and terminated our line of credit 
we incurred a million charge associated with these transactions 
equity in income of unconsolidated entities was million compared to a million loss in in  we had million gain from the sale of our interest in an unconsolidated entity which owned the sheraton premier hotel in tysons corner  virginia 
discontinued operations primarily reflects a million impairment charge and million gain from debt extinguishment related to two hotels transferred to lenders in full satisfaction of the related debt in discontinued operations in primarily consisted of i a million adjustment to gains on sale resulting from a change in the federal tax law that allowed recovery of previously paid alternative minimum taxes on gains from hotel sales in and  ii the following items related to two hotels sold in december a million impairment loss and a  loss on sale primarily related to selling costs  and iii million of operating losses and interest expense related to hotels placed in discontinued operations in and comparison of the years ended december  and for the year ended december   we recorded a million net loss attributable to common stockholders compared to a million net loss in our loss included million of impairment charges million in discontinued operations and million in equity in income of unconsolidated subsidiaries and a  gain from disposition in discontinued operations 
in  we also recorded losses from debt extinguishment in continuing operations million 
our loss included a million impairment charge million in continuing operations  million in discontinued operations and million related to equity method investments  million in accrued liquidated damages in discontinued operations  and hurricane related expenses of million million in continuing operations and  in discontinued operations 
these charges were partially offset by a million gain in continuing operations related to involuntary conversions associated with the final settlement of hurricane claims  as well as a million adjustment to gains in discontinued operations associated with hotel sales 
in total revenue was million  a decrease compared to the decrease in revenue is attributed principally to a decrease in revpar  which was driven by a decrease in occupancy and an decrease in adr 
hotel departmental expenses decreased million  compared to this expense reduction reflects i the decrease in occupancy  ii a million decrease in labor costs  which included permanent reductions in hotel employees  iii reduced non critical room expenses  such as guest transportation  in room amenities  bath linen quantities  and newspaper service  and iv menu modifications and reduced food costs in banquet and restaurant outlets 
as a percentage of total revenue  hotel departmental expenses increased from to compared to while we made significant reductions in our departmental expenses  they were not sufficient to completely offset the decrease in revenue 
other property related costs decreased million  compared to the expense reduction consisted of i a million decrease in labor costs  ii a million decrease in marketing assessments  credit card commissions and frequent guest expense all of which reflect the decrease in revenue  iii a million decrease in repairs and maintenance  partially attributed to our recently completed renovation program  iv reductions in other non critical expenses  and v improved energy efficiency 
as a percentage of total revenue  other property related costs increased from to compared to while we made significant reductions in our other property related costs  they were not sufficient to completely offset the decrease in revenue 
management and franchise fees decreased million compared to  reflecting the decrease in revenue 
as a percent of total revenue  franchise fees and base management fees remained essentially unchanged from to these fees are based on a percentage of revenue 
incentive management fees  which are based on the profitability of the hotels  decreased million 
taxes  insurance and lease expenses decreased million compared to this decrease relates primarily to i a million decrease in hotel percentage lease expense  attributed to decreased revenue at our consolidated hotel lessees  ii a million decrease in property and general liability insurance  attributed to improved insurance rates and liability claims experience  and iii a million decrease in land leases  attributed to decreases in percentage rent based on revenue 
this was partially offset by a million increase in real estate and other taxes  largely attributed to favorable resolutions of property tax appeals in as a percentage of total revenue  taxes  insurance and lease expense increased from in to 
corporate expenses increased million compared to the increase in corporate expenses is attributed to bonuses awarded in recognition of the accomplishment of corporate goals including successful restructuring of our debt in the face of the dysfunctional debt market and ongoing recession in and our portfolio relative performance  compared to our peers  from our efforts to improve market share and limit the effect of reduced revenue on hotel ebitda 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  compared to  primarily attributable to depreciation of million and million of consolidated hotel capital assets placed in service in and  respectively 
impairment charge 
in  we identified six hotels as candidates to be sold these hotels were held for investment at december   and tested these hotels for impairment using undiscounted estimated cash flows over a shortened estimated remaining hold period 
of the hotels tested  four hotels failed the test  and as a result  we recorded impairment charges of million 
in addition  because of triggering events in related to changes in the capital markets  dropping travel demand and the combined effect on our stock price  we tested all of our hotels to determine if further assessment for potential impairment was required 
we had one hotel with a short term ground lease fail this test 
we determined that the book value of this hotel was not fully recoverable  and as such  recorded a million impairment charge 
net interest expense increased million compared to this increase is primarily attributable to the issuance of our senior notes  which were issued in october debt extinguishment 
in  we retired million of senior notes due june and terminated our line of credit 
we incurred a million charge associated with these transactions 
equity in loss of unconsolidated entities was million compared to a million loss in we recorded million and million of impairment charges on our equity method investments in and  respectively 
the remainder of the change is attributed to current year operating losses from decreased revenue at our unconsolidated hotels 
discontinued operations primarily consisted of i a million adjustment to gains on sale resulting from a change in the federal tax law that allowed recovery of previously paid alternative minimum taxes on gains from hotel sales in and  ii the following items related to two hotels sold in december a million impairment loss  a  loss on sale primarily related to selling costs  and iii million of operating losses and interest expense related to hotels placed in discontinued operations in and discontinued operations in primarily consisted of i a million adjustment to gain on sales from revision of the tax liability associated with gains from hotel sales in and  ii the following items related to two hotels sold in december a million impairment loss  an million liquidated damage charge and  of hurricane losses  and iii million of operating losses and interest expense related to hotels placed in discontinued operations in and non gaap financial measures we refer in this annual report to certain non gaap financial measures 
these measures  including ffo  adjusted ffo  ebitda  adjusted ebitda  hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin  are measures of our financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the following tables reconcile these non gaap measures to the most comparable gaap financial measure 
immediately following the reconciliations  we include a discussion of why we believe these measures are useful supplemental measures of our performance and of the limitations upon such measures

substantially all of our non current assets consist of real estate 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  most industry investors consider supplemental measures of performance  which are not measures of operating performance under gaap  to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company operations 
these supplemental measures are not measures of operating performance under gaap 
however  we consider these non gaap measures to be supplemental measures of a hotel reit performance and should be considered along with  but not as an alternative to  net income loss attributable to felcor as a measure of our operating performance 
ffo and ebitda the white paper on funds from operations approved by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  defines ffo as net income or loss attributable to parent computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by nareit 
this may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do 
ebitda is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries 
we define ebitda as net income or loss attributable to parent computed in accordance with gaap plus interest expenses  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ebitda on the same basis 
adjustments to ffo and ebitda we adjust ffo and ebitda when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items  including but not limited to those described below  provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance and that the presentation of adjusted ffo  and adjusted ebitda when combined with gaap net income attributable to felcor  ebitda and ffo  is beneficial to an investor better understanding of our operating performance 
gains and losses related to extinguishment of debt and interest rate swaps we exclude gains and losses related to extinguishment of debt and interest rate swaps from ffo and ebitda because we believe that it is not indicative of ongoing operating performance of our hotel assets 
this also represents an acceleration of interest expense or a reduction of interest expense  and interest expense is excluded from ebitda 
impairment losses we exclude the effect of impairment losses and gains or losses on disposition of assets in computing adjusted ffo and adjusted ebitda because we believe that including these is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our remaining assets 
additionally  we believe that impairment charges and gains or losses on disposition of assets represent accelerated depreciation  or excess depreciation  and depreciation is excluded from ffo by the nareit definition and from ebitda 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle infrequently  the financial accounting standards board promulgates new accounting standards that require the consolidated statements of operations to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we exclude these one time adjustments in computing adjusted ffo and adjusted ebitda because they do not reflect our actual performance for that period 
in addition  to derive adjusted ebitda we exclude gains or losses on the sale of depreciable assets because we believe that including them in ebitda is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our remaining assets 
additionally  the gain or loss on sale of depreciable assets represents either accelerated depreciation or excess depreciation in previous periods  and depreciation is excluded from ebitda 
hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin are commonly used measures of performance in the hotel industry and give investors a more complete understanding of the operating results over which our individual hotels and brand managers have direct control 
we believe that hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin are useful to investors by providing greater transparency with respect to two significant measures that we use in our financial and operational decision making 
additionally  using these measures facilitates comparisons with other hotel reits and hotel owners 
we present hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin by eliminating all revenues and expenses from continuing operations not directly associated with hotel operations  including corporate level expenses  depreciation and amortization  and expenses related to our capital structure 
we eliminate corporate level costs and expenses because we believe property level results provide investors with supplemental information into the ongoing operational performance of our hotels and the effectiveness of management on a property level basis 
we eliminate depreciation and amortization because  even though depreciation and amortization are property level expenses  we do not believe that these non cash expenses  which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets  and implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  accurately reflect an adjustment in the value of our assets 
we also eliminate consolidated percentage rent paid to unconsolidated entities  which is effectively eliminated by noncontrolling interests and equity in income from unconsolidated subsidiaries  and include the cost of unconsolidated taxes  insurance and lease expense  to reflect the entire operating costs applicable to our consolidated hotels 
hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margins are presented on a same store basis and exclude the historical results of operations from the fairmont copley plaza acquired in august use and limitations of non gaap measures our management and board of directors use ffo  adjusted ffo  ebitda  adjusted ebitda  hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin to evaluate the performance of our hotels and to facilitate comparisons between us and other lodging reits  hotel owners who are not reits and other capital intensive companies 
we use hotel ebitda and hotel ebitda margin in evaluating hotel level performance and the operating efficiency of our hotel managers 
the use of these non gaap financial measures has certain limitations 
these non gaap financial measures as presented by us  may not be comparable to non gaap financial measures as calculated by other real estate companies 
these measures do not reflect certain expenses or expenditures that we incurred and will incur  such as depreciation  interest and capital expenditures 
management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance 
our reconciliations to the most comparable gaap financial measures  and our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows  include interest expense  capital expenditures  and other excluded items  all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance  as well as the usefulness of our non gaap financial measures 
these non gaap financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with gaap 
they should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit  cash flow from operations  or any other operating performance measure prescribed by gaap 
these non gaap financial measures reflect additional ways of viewing our operations that we believe  when viewed with our gaap results and the reconciliations to the corresponding gaap financial measures  provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure 
management strongly encourages investors to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities during the year ended december   we generated million of cash provided by operating activities  primarily from hotel operations a million decline  compared to this decline primarily reflects an increase in interest paid 
at december   we had million of cash  including approximately million held under management agreements to meet working capital needs 
travel demand began to improve in late following the deep recession  which resulted in improved occupancy through we began experiencing sustained improvement in adr in the third and fourth quarters as we re mixed our customer mix 
we expect continued growth in adr and revpar in we expect our revpar will increase from to compared to  which assumes continued occupancy and adr growth 
we expect to million of cash from operating activities 
we are subject to increases in hotel operating expenses  including wage and benefit costs  repair and maintenance expenses  utilities and insurance expenses that can fluctuate disproportionately to revenues 
some of these operating expenses are difficult to predict and control  which lends volatility to our operating results 
we have implemented extensive cost containment initiatives at our hotels  including reducing headcount and improving productivity and energy efficiency 
if revpar decreases  or fails to grow in line with or better than occupancy  and or hotel ebitda margins shrink  our operations  earnings and or cash flow could be materially adversely affected 
investing activities during the year ended december   cash used in investing activities increased million  compared to  due primarily to our million purchase of the fairmont copley plaza  which was partially offset by lower spending on hotel capital expenditures 
we made extensive capital investments in our hotels from to  as a part of a comprehensive renovation program 
as a result  we were able to limit capital spending significantly in and in  we completed approximately million of capital improvements at our hotels 
we also repaid our share of a joint venture mortgage debt for million and subsequently sold our interest in the venture receiving million 
as part of our long term capital plan  we anticipate renovating between six and eight core hotels each year 
in  we will start renovations at six hotels  in addition to a redevelopment project at the fairmont copley plaza that will refresh the property and implement various value enhancing initiatives 
we expect to spend approximately million in non discretionary capital and to million in discretionary renovation and redevelopment capital in including more than million at the fairmont copley plaza  which payments will be funded from operating cash flow and cash on hand 
financing activities for the year ended december   cash provided by financing activities decreased by million compared to  due primarily to borrowings our since terminated line of credit and our new senior notes not used to retire debt and the payment of million to retire million of debt  this was partially offset by proceeds from our june public common stock offering 
we expect to pay approximately million in normally occurring principal payments  million to retire maturing senior notes and million in preferred dividends in  which payments will be funded from operating cash flow and cash on hand 
we expect to refinance or extend the remaining debt maturing in in january  we reinstated our current quarterly preferred dividend and paid current quarterly preferred dividends of million 
we cannot pay any common dividends unless and until all accrued and current preferred dividends are paid 
our board of directors will determine whether and when to declare future dividends including the accrued but unpaid preferred dividends based upon various factors  including operating results  economic conditions  other operating trends  our financial condition and capital requirements  as well as minimum reit distribution requirements 
common stock offering 
in june  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock at per share 
the net proceeds from the offering  after underwriting discounts  were approximately million 
we used these proceeds together with cash on hand to repay million of secured debt for million and for our million acquisition of the fairmont copley plaza 
secured debt 
at december   we had a total of billion of consolidated secured debt with encumbered consolidated hotels including hotels that are collateral for our senior secured notes having a billion aggregate net book value 
in november  we incurred million of new debt  secured by two hotels 
the loan bears interest at libor subject to a floor plus and is scheduled to mature in november  with a one year extension option that is exercisable subject to certain conditions 
in june  we repaid million of secured debt scheduled to mature in for million  plus accrued interest  representing a discount to the principal balance 
this allowed us to reduce our leverage substantially and unencumbered two hotels 
in may  we obtained a new million loan  secured by nine hotels that matures in this loan bears interest at libor subject to a floor plus 
the proceeds were used to repay million in loans that were secured by hotels and scheduled to mature in may the terms and interest rate of this new financing are significantly more favorable than the refinanced debt  and we unencumbered two previously mortgaged hotels in the process 
in february  we extended the maturity of a loan secured by one hotel from may to may two loans totaling million matured in may the cash flows for the hotels that secured those loans did not cover debt service  and we stopped funding the shortfalls in december we were unable to negotiate an acceptable debt modification or reduction that favored our stockholders  and we transferred these hotels to the lenders in full satisfaction of the related debt 
except in the case of our senior notes  our mortgage debt is generally recourse solely to the specific hotels securing the debt except in case of fraud  misapplication of funds and certain other limited recourse carve out provisions  which could extend recourse to us 
much of our secured debt allows us to substitute collateral under certain conditions and is prepayable  subject to various prepayment  yield maintenance or defeasance obligations 
much of our secured debt includes lock box arrangements under certain circumstances 
we are permitted to spend an amount required to cover our budgeted hotel operating expenses  taxes  debt service  insurance and capital expenditure reserves even if revenues are flowing through a lock box in cases where a specified debt service coverage ratio is not met 
with the exception of one hotel  all of our consolidated loans subject to lock box provisions currently exceed the applicable minimum debt service coverage ratios 
senior notes 
our senior notes require that we satisfy total leverage  secured leverage and interest coverage thresholds in order to i incur additional indebtedness except to refinance maturing debt with replacement debt  as defined under our indentures  ii pay dividends in excess of the minimum distributions required to meet the reit qualification test  iii repurchase capital stock  or iv merge 
at december   we exceeded the relevant minimum thresholds 
these notes are guaranteed by us  and payment of those obligations is secured by a pledge of the limited partner interests in felcor lp owned by felcor  a combination of first lien mortgages and related security interests and or negative pledges on up to hotels  and pledges of equity interests in certain subsidiaries of felcor lp 
in connection with issuing our senior notes in  we amended the indenture governing our senior notes maturing in to eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants  guarantees  collateral and certain events of default provisions 
in we retired an additional million of our senior notes that mature and will be repaid in june of which million now remain outstanding 
interest rate caps 
to fulfill requirements under certain loans  we entered into interest rate cap agreements with aggregate notional amounts of million and million at december  and  respectively 
these interest rate caps were not designated as hedges and had insignificant fair values at both december  and  resulting in no significant net earnings impact 
consolidated debt consisted of the following in thousands encumbered hotels interest rate december  maturity date december  mortgage debt mortgage debt hotels l a november mortgage debt hotels l b april mortgage debt hotels l c august d mortgage debt hotels april mortgage debt e hotels june august mortgage debt hotels l november f mortgage debt hotel may mortgage debt hotel july mortgage debt hotel june other may senior notes senior secured notes g hotels october senior notes june retired debt total hotels a we purchased an interest rate cap that caps libor at and expires november for a million notional amount

e the hotels securing this debt are subject to separate loan agreements and are not cross collateralized 
f this loan can be extended for one year  subject to satisfying certain conditions 
g these notes have million in aggregate principal outstanding and were sold at a discount that provides a yield to maturity before transaction costs

the following schedule details these obligations at december  in thousands total less than year years years after years debt a b operating leases purchase obligations ihg liquidated damages c total contractual obligations a our long term debt consists of both secured and unsecured debt and includes both principal and interest 
interest expense for variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at december  b included in this number is debt of million that can be extended for as many as two years to  and million that can be extended to  both subject to satisfying certain conditions 
c these liquidated damages were paid in january off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had unconsolidated investments in ventures that own an aggregate of hotels referred to as hotel joint ventures 
we own more than of the operating lessees operating of these hotels and one hotel is operated without a lease 
we also owned a interest in entities that provide condominium management services and develop condominiums in myrtle beach  south carolina 
none of our directors  officers or employees owns any interest in any of these joint ventures or entities 
the hotel joint ventures had million of non recourse mortgage debt relating to these hotels  of which our pro rata portion was million  none of which is reflected as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
our liabilities with regard to non recourse debt and the liabilities of our subsidiaries that are members or partners in joint ventures are generally limited to guarantees of the borrowing entity s obligations to pay for the lender s losses caused by misconduct  fraud or misappropriation of funds by the venture and other typical exceptions from the non recourse provisions in the mortgages  such as for environmental liabilities 
we have recorded equity in income loss of unconsolidated entities of million includes million of gains from sale  million  and million includes million of impairment losses for the years ended december   and  respectively  and received distributions of million of which million was provided from operations  million of which million was provided from operations  and million of which million was provided from operations  for the years  and  respectively 
the principal source of income for our hotel joint ventures is percentage lease revenue from their operating lessees 
capital expenditures on the hotels owned by our hotel joint ventures are generally funded from the income from operations of these ventures 
however  if a venture has insufficient cash flow to meet operating expenses or make necessary capital improvements  the venture may make a capital call upon the venture members or partners to fund such necessary improvements 
it is possible that  in the event of a capital call  the other joint venture member or partner may be unwilling or unable to make the necessary capital contributions 
under such circumstances  we may elect to make the other party s contribution as a loan to the venture or as an additional capital contribution by us 
under certain circumstances  a capital contribution by us may increase our equity investment to greater than and may require that we consolidate the venture  including all of its assets and liabilities  into our consolidated financial statements 
with respect to those ventures that are partnerships  the hotels owned by these ventures could perform below expectations and result in the insolvency of the ventures and the acceleration of their debts  unless the members or partners provide additional capital 
in some ventures  the members or partners may be required to make additional capital contributions or have their interest in the venture be reduced or offset for the benefit of any party making the required investment on their behalf 
we may be faced with the choice of losing our investment in a venture or investing additional capital under circumstances that do not assure a return on that investment 
inflation operators of hotels  in general  possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation 
competitive pressures may  however  require us to reduce room rates in the near term and may limit our ability to raise room rates in the future 
we are also subject to the risk that inflation will cause increases in hotel operating expenses disproportionately to revenues 
seasonality the lodging business is seasonal in nature 
generally  hotel revenues are greater in the second and third calendar quarters than in the first and fourth calendar quarters  although this may not be true for hotels in major tourist destinations 
revenues for hotels in tourist areas generally are substantially greater during tourist season than other times of the year 
seasonal variations in revenue at our hotels can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenues 
quarterly earnings also may be adversely affected by events beyond our control  such as extreme weather conditions  economic factors and other considerations affecting travel 
to the extent that cash flow from operations is insufficient during any quarter  due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenues  we may utilize cash on hand or borrowings to satisfy our obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  the carrying value of investments in hotels  litigation  and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we record an impairment charge when we believe that an investment in one or more of our hotels held for investment has been impaired  such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the book basis  or net book value  of the investment 
we test for impairment when certain events occur  including one or more of the following projected cash flows are significantly less than recent historical cash flows  significant changes in legal factors or actions by a regulator that could affect the value of our hotels  events that could cause changes or uncertainty in travel patterns  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  a hotel will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
in the evaluation of impairment of our hotels  and in establishing impairment charges  we made many assumptions and estimates on a hotel by hotel basis  which included the following annual cash flow growth rates for revenues and expenses  holding periods  expected remaining useful lives of assets  estimates in fair values taking into consideration future cash flows  capitalization rates  discount rates and comparable selling prices  and future capital expenditures 
we record an impairment charge when one or more of our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries experiences an other than temporary decline in fair value 
any decline in fair value that is not expected to be recovered in the next months is considered other than temporary 
we record an impairment in our equity based investments as a reduction in the carrying value of the investment 
our estimates of fair values are based on future cash flow estimates  capitalization rates  discount rates and comparable selling prices 
changes in these estimates  future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying hotels could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of our hotels or investments in unconsolidated entities  thereby requiring future impairment charges 
we capitalize interest and certain other costs  such as property taxes  land leases  property insurance and employee costs related to hotels undergoing major renovations and redevelopments 
such costs capitalized in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
we make estimates with regard to when components of the renovated asset or redevelopment project are taken out of service or placed in service when determining the appropriate amount and time to capitalize these costs 
if these estimates are inaccurate  we could capitalize too much or too little with regard to a particular project 
depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets  and amortization expense for leasehold improvements is the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets 
the lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions including cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish the assets  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
while we believe our estimates are reasonable  a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation and amortization expense and net income loss or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels 
investments in hotel properties are based on purchase price and allocated to land  property and equipment  identifiable intangible assets and assumed debt and other liabilities at fair value 
any remaining unallocated purchase price  if any  is treated as goodwill 
property and equipment are recorded at fair value based on current replacement cost for similar capacity and allocated to buildings  improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment using appraisals and valuations prepared by management and or independent third parties 
identifiable intangible assets typically contracts including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements are recorded at fair value  although no value is generally allocated to contracts which are at market terms 
above market and below market contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair value of contract rates for corresponding contracts measured over the period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the contract 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the remaining non cancelable term of the related agreements 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  we may utilize a number of sources such as those obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data  including third party appraisals and valuations 
we make estimates with respect to contingent liabilities for losses covered by insurance 
we record liabilities for self insured losses under our insurance programs when it becomes probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of our financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we are self insured for the first  per occurrence  of our general liability claims with regard to of our hotels 
we review the adequacy of our reserves for our self insured claims on a regular basis 
our reserves are intended to cover the estimated ultimate uninsured liability for losses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred at the end of each accounting period 
these reserves represent estimates at a given date  generally utilizing projections based on claims  historical settlement of claims and estimates of future costs to settle claims 
estimates are also required since there may be delays in reporting 
because establishment of insurance reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates  currently established reserves may not be sufficient 
if our insurance reserves of million  at december   for general liability losses are insufficient  we will record an additional expense in future periods 
property and catastrophic losses are event driven losses and  as such  until a loss occurs and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated  no liability is recorded 
we recorded no contingent liabilities with regard to property or catastrophic losses at december  our taxable reit subsidiaries  or trss  have cumulative potential future tax deductions totaling million 
the deferred income tax asset associated with these potential future tax deductions was million 
we recorded a valuation allowance related to our trss net deferred tax asset  because of the uncertainty of realizing the asset s benefit 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase operating income in the period such determination was made
