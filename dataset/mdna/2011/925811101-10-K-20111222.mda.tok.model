management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue is generally recognized when products are sold and title is passed to the customer 
advance service billings are deferred and recognized as revenues on a pro rata basis over the term of the service agreement 
pursuant to financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  the company evaluates multiple element revenue arrangements for separate units of accounting  and follows appropriate revenue recognition policies for each separate unit 
elements are considered separate units of accounting provided that i the delivered item has stand alone value to the customer  ii there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item  and iii if a general right of return exists relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially within the control of the company 
as applied to the company  under arrangements involving the sale of product and the provision of services  product sales are recognized as revenue when the products are sold and title is passed to the customer  and service revenue is recognized as services are performed 
for products that include more than incidental software  and for separate licenses of the company s software products  the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the provisions of fasb accounting standards update asu  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu 
asu  which was adopted by the company effective october  on a prospective basis  provides revenue recognition guidance for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable in the arrangement based on the fair value of the elements 
the fair value for each deliverable is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or best estimate of selling price besp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
besp must be determined in a manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the specific elements on a standalone basis 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of its customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while the company engages in product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  its warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from its estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence and slow moving inventory equal to the difference between the carrying cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
technology changes and market conditions may render some of the company s products obsolete and additional inventory write downs may be required 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of its long lived assets  including identifiable intangible assets with finite useful lives  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
the company evaluates the recoverability of such assets based upon the expectations of undiscounted cash flows from such assets 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss would be recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount 
the company ability to recover the reported amounts of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient taxable income during the periods over which net temporary tax differences become deductible 
in the third quarter ended june   the company recognized a million charge to provide a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of future realization 
the establishment of such valuation allowance was determined to be appropriate during the period due to updated judgments in light of the company operating losses since fiscal year and the inherent uncertainties of predicting future operating results in periods over which such net tax differences become deductible 
the company plans to provide a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets until such time that it can achieve a sustained level of profitability or other positive evidence arises that would demonstrate an ability to recover such assets 
the company accrues liabilities for identified tax contingencies that result from positions that are being challenged or could be challenged by tax authorities 
the company believes that its accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open years  based on management s assessment of many factors  including its interpretations of the tax law and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities 
however  it is possible that the ultimate resolution of any tax audit may be materially greater or lower than the amount accrued 
the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to labor  product and other matters 
the company assesses the likelihood of an adverse judgment or outcomes for these matters  as well as the range of potential losses 
a determination of the reserves required  if any  is made after careful analysis 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
asu clarifies some existing concepts  eliminates wording differences between us gaap and ifrs  and in some limited cases  changes some principles to achieve convergence between us gaap and ifrs 
asu results in a consistent definition of fair value and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure about fair value between us gaap and ifrs 
asu also expands the disclosures for fair value measurements that are estimated using significant unobservable level inputs 
asu will be effective for the company beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of asu to have a material effect on its operating results or financial position 
in june  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued accounting standard update asu  presentation of comprehensive income  which requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate but consecutive statements 
asu eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders equity 
asu will be effective for the company beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of asu to have a material effect on its operating results or financial position 
however  it will impact the presentation of comprehensive income
