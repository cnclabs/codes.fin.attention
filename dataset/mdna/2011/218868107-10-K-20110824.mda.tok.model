item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the company consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report on form k 
background and overview as of june   we operated colleges with  students in states and the province of ontario  canada 
during the fiscal year ended june   the company had net revenues of  million 
our revenues consist principally of student tuition and fees and are presented as net revenues after adjustments for refunds related to students who do not complete their courses 
we recognize revenues pro rata on a straight line basis over the relevant period attended by the student of the applicable course or program 
net revenues from continuing operations increased to  million in from  million in the increase is primarily due to an increase in the average student population offset by a decrease of in the average revenue rate per student during the period 
the student population varies depending on  among other factors  the number of i continuing students at the beginning of a fiscal period  ii new student enrollments during the fiscal period  iii students who have previously withdrawn but who reenter during the fiscal period  and iv graduations and withdrawals during the fiscal period 
new student starts typically occur several times per month in the diploma granting colleges 
in the degree granting colleges  the majority of new student starts occur in the first month of each calendar quarter with an additional mini start in the second month of each quarter in most colleges 
the tuition charges vary by college depending on the local market  the program level diploma  associate  bachelor or master degree and the specific curriculum 
the majority of students at our colleges rely on funds received under various government sponsored student financial aid programs to pay a substantial portion of their tuition and other education related expenses 
serving atb students has historically been part of the company mission 
however  atb students are a higher risk population who complete their programs at a lower rate and default on their student loans at a higher rate than high school graduates 
accordingly  given the shift to a year default measurement period and the structural changes in student lending over the past two years  we stopped enrolling atb students into our us everest and wyotech institutions on september  due to the success of our default prevention initiatives  we resumed enrolling atb students on a more limited basis in june we plan to limit atb students to a maximum of of total enrollment 
at june   atb students accounted for approximately of our enrollments 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts on those financial statements 
note to the consolidated financial statements in the annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended june  describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to our allowance for doubtful accounts  insurance self insurance  goodwill and intangible assets  deferred taxes  discontinued operations  contingencies and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making 
table of contents judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or if our assumptions change 
our critical accounting estimates are those which we believe require our most significant judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
a discussion of our critical accounting estimates is as follows allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability  failure or refusal of our students to make required payments 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing the accounts receivable aging and applying various expected loss percentages to certain student accounts receivable categories based upon historical bad debt experience and consideration of the current economic environment 
we generally write off accounts receivable balances deemed uncollectible as they are sent to collection agencies 
we offer a variety of payment plans to help students pay that portion of their education expense not covered by financial aid programs 
these balances are unsecured and not guaranteed 
we believe our reserves are adequate  however  losses related to unpaid student balances could exceed the amounts we have reserved for bad debts 
the effect of an increase in our accounts receivable allowance of of our outstanding receivables from to or million to million would result in a decrease in pre tax income of million for the year ended june  the effect of an increase in our student notes receivable allowance of of our outstanding earned notes receivable from to or million to million would result in a decrease in pre tax income of million for the year ended june  many of our students in the us participate in federally guaranteed student loan programs 
the federally guaranteed student loans are authorized by the higher education act hea of and are guaranteed by an agency of the federal government 
the guaranteed loans are not guaranteed by us  and the guaranteed student loans cannot become an obligation of ours 
accordingly  we do not record an obligation to repay any of the guaranteed loans that are not repaid by our former students and we do not record either a contingent obligation or an allowance for future obligations as a result of student defaults of federally guaranteed student loans 
however  if an institution former students default rate on guaranteed loans the cohort default rate equals or exceeds for three consecutive years  the institution may lose participation eligibility in the guaranteed loan program and its students would be denied access to the guaranteed loan program 
our institutions cohort default rates act as a gatekeeper to their eligibility to participate in the federal student financial aid programs 
we have no obligation to repay any of the federally guaranteed loans that our former students default upon  even if the cohort default rates of our students exceed permitted levels 
rather  if the cohort default rates at a particular institution exceed for three consecutive years under current calculations  the institution students may lose eligibility to receive federal student financial aid 
under the heoa  a separate calculation will be performed that will add an additional federal fiscal year of borrowers repayment performance 
pursuant to the heoa  this percentage will increase to after three years of cohort default rates calculated with the additional federal fiscal year are available  and then become applicable to the imposition of sanctions 
insurance self insurance 
we use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including claims related to employee health care  workers compensation  general liability  and business interruption 
liabilities associated with these risks are estimated based on  among other things  historical claims experience  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
the company loss exposure related to self insurance is limited by stop loss coverage 
our expected loss accruals are based on estimates  and while we believe the amounts accrued are adequate  the ultimate loss may differ from the amounts provided 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets 
we have significant goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired  including identified intangible assets 
we consider a number of factors  including valuations and appraisals from independent valuation firms  in determining the amounts that are assignable to other intangible assets  such as curriculum  accreditation  and trade names 
we  however  are ultimately responsible for the valuations 
the fair value of identified intangible assets is derived using accepted valuation methodologies  including cost  market  and income approaches  as appropriate  following consultations with valuation firms and the requirements set forth by the uniform standards of professional appraisal practice 
we do not amortize goodwill  accreditation  or trade names as these assets meet the indefinite life criteria within the accounting standards 
curricula are amortized over their useful lives ranging generally from five to fifteen years and the amortization is included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter or earlier in the year upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate goodwill is more likely than not to be impaired 
the testing of goodwill for impairment is required to be performed at the level referred to as the reporting unit 
a reporting unit is either the operating segment level or one level below  which is referred to as a component 
we performed the goodwill impairment test one level below the operating segment level 
during the second quarter of fiscal  our market capitalization was below book value  which we considered an indicator of impairment 
consequently  we performed an interim impairment test on goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
we believe that continued regulatory uncertainties  and the potential impact of new regulations  particularly regulations regarding gainful employment  have had a sustained negative impact on our stock price and current fair value 
the results of the interim impairment test indicated that the fair value of two of our reporting units with identified goodwill of million was less than their carrying value 
accordingly  we estimated the implied fair value of the goodwill of these reporting units by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  with any residual fair value allocated to goodwill 
as a result of this analysis  we determined that the current fair value of the goodwill in these reporting units was  and accordingly recorded an impairment charge of million  the majority of which was non deductible for tax purposes during fiscal we determined the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach  based on discounted cash flow dcf  and a market based approach 
the dcf incorporated our cash flow projections and a terminal value 
this amount was then discounted using a weighted average cost of capital wacc which considered our costs of debt and equity 
we then reconciled the calculated fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization  including a reasonable premium  as another consideration in assessing fair value 
in establishing the wacc  consideration was given to specific regulatory risks related to each reporting unit including the impact of our decision with respect to enrolling ability to benefit students 
our revenue projections did not incorporate potential future regulatory changes related to gainful employment as such regulations had not been finalized 
accordingly  further negative developments in the regulatory environment could impact future assessments and result in impairments of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
in addition  impairment assessments involve significant judgments related to future revenues and earnings 
although we believe we have made reasonable and supportable estimates in connection with our impairment analyses  changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and result in future impairments 
the remaining goodwill of million relates to the heald acquisition in january our impairment tests of the indefinite lived intangible assets did not result in an impairment charge 
a 
table of contents decline in the fair value of heald could result in impairment charges to be recorded in the future 
at august   the stock price has declined to from at june  additionally  if our stock price remains depressed or declines further  we could incur impairment charges related to the write down of goodwill and other intangible assets 
indefinite lived intangible assets are tested annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment  by comparing their fair values to their carrying amounts 
to the extent the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount  an impairment charge is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
such testing would include estimating the future cash flows expected to be received from the assets and comparing them to their carrying values 
if the estimate of the present value of these future cash flows was below the carrying values of the related assets  the company would consider the assets to be impaired and take a charge to write down those assets to fair value 
the determination of related estimated useful lives of intangible assets and whether or not intangible assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
although we believe our goodwill and intangible assets are fairly stated  changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to asset balances 
deferred taxes 
we currently have deferred income tax assets which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that more likely than not will be realized 
realization of our deferred income tax assets is principally dependent upon achievement of projected future taxable income offset by deferred income tax liabilities 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred income tax assets annually 
in addition  we review our income tax filing positions quarterly and update our tax contingency reserves as necessary 
see note income taxes 
contingencies 
in the ordinary conduct of the business  we are subject to occasional lawsuits  investigations and claims  including  but not limited to  claims involving students and graduates and routine employment matters 
when we are aware of a claim or potential claim  we assess the likelihood of any loss or exposure 
if it is probable that a loss will result and the amount of the loss can reasonably estimated  we record a liability for the loss 
if the loss is not probable or the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated  we disclose the nature of the specific claim if the likelihood of a potential loss is reasonably possible and the amount involved is material 
there can be no assurance that the ultimate outcome of any of the lawsuits  investigations or claims pending against us will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

net revenues increased million  or  from  million in fiscal to  million in fiscal the increase is primarily due to an increase in the average student population offset partially by a decrease in the average revenue rate per student during the period 
the increase in the average student population is primarily due to the full year impact of the heald acquisition

educational services expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to  million in fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  educational services expenses increased from of revenues in fiscal to of revenues in fiscal the increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation expense  facility costs  and student services expense 
the increase in facilities costs as a percentage of revenues was a result of a lower level of utilization of our facilities in fiscal as compared to fiscal as the costs of operating of our facilities is largely fixed in nature  this lower level of capacity utilization negatively affects educational services expenses as a percentage of revenues

during the second quarter of we incurred a goodwill impairment charge of million 
see the critical accounting policies and estimates section for further discussion regarding the factors leading to the impairment loss and the valuation methodologies and assumptions used in the goodwill impairment test

educational services expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  educational services expenses decreased from of revenues in fiscal to of revenues in fiscal the decrease as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to a reduction in bad debt expense and facility costs 
bad debt expense amounted to million and of net revenue in fiscal compared to million and of net revenue in fiscal the improvement in bad debt expense was primarily the result of higher student retention and continued efficiencies in packaging students with financial aid

in addition  the company recorded a severance charge of million 
there were no such charges in fiscal provision for income taxes 
the effective income tax rate was of income before income taxes in fiscal compared to of income before income taxes in fiscal seasonality and other factors affecting quarterly results our revenues normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business 
student population varies as a result of new student enrollments and student attrition 
historically  our colleges  schools and training centers have had lower student populations in the first fiscal quarter than in the remainder of the year 
our expenses  however  do not vary as significantly as student population and revenues 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results to continue as a result of seasonal enrollment patterns 
such patterns may change  however  as a result of acquisitions  new branch openings  new program adoptions and increased enrollments from recent high school graduates 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period

historically  we had developed several loan programs with origination and servicing providers such as sallie mae for students with low credit scores who otherwise would not qualify for loans 
these loan programs required that we pay a discount fee to the origination and servicing providers of the loans as 
table of contents a reserve against future defaults on these loans 
we have historically referred to these types of loans as discount loans  since we incurred a portion of the default risk related to these student loans by taking a discount on the disbursement 
by accepting a reduced payment for these discounted loans from the servicing providers  we were not at risk for the amounts agreed to by them and the service providers but were not entitled to any proceeds collected by the service providers in excess of this amount 
therefore we had recorded this discount as a reduction to revenue 
in fiscal we were informed by sallie mae and two other origination and servicing providers that they would no longer make private loans available for students who present higher credit risks ie subprime borrowers 
in the face of this change in policy  we created a new lending program in the fourth quarter of fiscal with a different origination and servicing provider  genesis lending services  inc genesis  who specializes in subprime credit 
this genesis lending program has characteristics similar to our previous discount loan programs 
as with our previous discount loan program  under this genesis program we pay a discount to the origination and servicing provider for any loans purchased by genesis and record the discount as a reduction to revenue 
however  unlike our previous discount loan programs  under our new discount program we have both the right and an obligation to acquire the related loan  except in certain limited circumstances where genesis does not comply with the terms of our agreement 
since we initiated the new discount program  we have acquired all of the loans that have been originated 
therefore  we are currently exposed to any credit defaults by our students but retain all amounts collected from our students under the current program 
additionally  the new discount loan program has also replaced our legacy loan program  called star 
we estimate loans funded under the genesis program  net of estimated refunds have been approximately million  million and million  for the years ended june   and  respectively 
these amounts are an estimate as some loans contain amounts that will be recognized during future periods 
accordingly  unrecognized loans amounts are subject to the company refund policy 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company sold to asfg  llc asfg  on a non recourse basis  part of its current portfolio of student loans for approximately million  with no material gain or loss on the sale 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company incurred a one time impairment charge of approximately million associated with the sale of these loans 
the charge is due to the write off of related assets and liabilities  primarily imputed interest
