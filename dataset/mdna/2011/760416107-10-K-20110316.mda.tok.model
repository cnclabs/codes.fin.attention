this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
certain risks  uncertainties and other factors  including but not limited to those set forth in item a  entitled  risk factors and elsewhere in this report may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
executive summary during  we completed several positive initiatives which management believes improved the quality of its balance sheet and put the company in a stronger capital position 
the highlights for are as follows raised approximately million in new capital through a common stock offering that increased total shareholders equity to million 
repositioned the balance sheet by shifting focus to low cost core deposit growth and reducing dependence on brokered deposits 
reduced non performing loan balances for two consecutive quarters since their peak in the second quarter of completed the re branding to the name republic bank 
successfully opened first new look store in haddonfield  nj 
management believes that the customer focused retail model will drive low cost core deposit growth  which is essential to shareholder value and growth 
our retail model is designed to provide superior customer service and a great retail experience that is expected to turn customers into fans and build a successful franchise for our shareholders 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates in reviewing and understanding our financial information  you are encouraged to read and understand the significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
these policies are described in note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the accounting and financial reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and to general practices within the banking industry 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the repor ting period 
management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis including those related to the allowance for loan losses  other than temporary impairment of securities and deferred income taxes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these form the basis for making judgments on the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies related to the allowance for loan losses  other than temporary impairment of securities and deferred income taxes as being critical 
allowance for loan losses management s ongoing evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on our past loan loss experience  the volume and composition of our lending  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  current economic conditions and other factors affecting the known and inherent risk in the portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by charges to income through the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge offs net of recoveries 
the allowance is maintained at a level that management  based upon its evaluation  considers adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requ ires material estimates including  among others  the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impacted loans  exposure at default  value of collateral  and estimated losses on our commercial and residential loan portfolios 
all of these estimates may be susceptible to significant change 
the allowance consists of specific allowances for both impaired loans and all classified loans  which are not impaired  and a general allowance on the remainder of the portfolio 
although management determines the amount of each element of the allowance separately  the entire allowance for loan losses is available for the entire portfolio 
management establishes an allowance on certain impaired loans for the amount by which the discounted cash flows  observable market price  or fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent  is lower than the carrying value of the loan 
a loan is considered to be impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan 
a delay or shortfall in amount of payments does not necessarily result in the loan being identified as impaired 
management also establishes a specific valuation allowance on classified loans  which are not impaired 
we segregate these loans by category and assign allowances to each loan based on inherent losses associated with each type of lending and consideration that these loans  in the aggregate  represent an above average credit risk and that more of these loans will prove to be uncollectible compared to loans in the general portfolio 
classification of a loan within this category is based on identified weaknesses that increase the credit risk of the loan 
management also establishes a general allowance on non classified loans to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities  but which  unlike specific allowances  have not been allocated to particular loans 
this general valuation allowance is determined by segregating the loans by loan category and assigning allowance percentages based on our historical loss experience  delinquency trends  and management s evaluation of the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
the allowance is adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
these significant factors may include changes in lending policies and procedures  changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting its primary lending areas  credit quality trends  collateral value  loan volumes and concentrations  seasoning of the loan portfolio  loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  duration of the current business cycle  and bank regulatory examination results 
the applied loss factors are re evaluated each reporting period to ensure their relevance in the current economic environment 
while management uses the best information known to it in order to make loan loss allowance valuations  adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  or changes in accounting guidance 
in times of economic slowdown  either regional or national  the risk inherent in the loan portfolio could increase resulting in the need for additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses in future periods 
an increase could also be necessitated by an increase in the size of the loan portfolio or in any of its components even though the credit quality of the overall portfolio may be improving 
historically  the estimates of the allowance for loan loss have provided adequate coverage against actual losses incurred 
in addition  the penn sylvania department of banking and the fdic  as an integral part of their examination processes  periodically review the allowance for loan losses 
the pennsylvania department of banking or the fdic may require the recognition of adjustment to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examinations 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from management s estimates  additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
other than temporary impairment of securities securities are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis  and more frequently when market conditions warrant such an evaluation  to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporary 
to determine whether a loss in value is other than temporary  management utilizes criteria such as the reasons underlying the decline  the magnitude and duration of the decline and our intent and ability to retain its investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in the fair value 
the term other than temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent  but indicates that the prospects for a near term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable  or that the re is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment 
once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized 
income taxes management makes estimates and judgments to calculate various tax liabilities and determine the recoverability of various deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenues and expenses 
management also estimates a reserve for deferred tax assets if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
these estimates and judgments are inherently subjective 
historically  management s estimates and judgments to calculate the deferred tax accounts have not required significant revision 
in evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets  management considers all available positive and negative evidence  including the past operating results and forecast of future taxable income 
in determining future taxable income  management makes assumptions for the amount of taxable income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require management to make judgments about the future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the business 
any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require management to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period and could have a significant impac t on future earnings 
results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  overview we had a net loss of million or per diluted share for as compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  for interest income decreased million due to a decrease in average loans outstanding from million at december  to million at december  the decrease was due to our intentional effort to reduce exposure in our commercial real estate cre portfolio 
the decrease in interest income is more than offset by a decrease in interest expense of million  which was primarily driven by a decrease in the cost of interest bearing deposits from at december  to at december  as we continue to focus on the gathering of low cost core deposits 
the provision for loan losses increased to million during  as compared to million for  reflecting additional reserves on certain loans as we continue to deal with the impact of the current economic environment 
non interest income increased to million in from  in  primarily due to million reduction in impairment charges on bank pooled trust preferred securities held in our investment portfolio and a million gain on sale of investment securities 
non interest expenses increased million to million for as compared to million for  which was primarily due to million of one time charges related to the termination of the merger agreement with metro bancorp  inc  as well as an increase of  in costs associated with other real estate owned and  in legal fees related to the work out of problem loans 
return on average assets and average equity was and respectively  for as compared to and respecti vely  for average balances and net interest income historically  our earnings have depended primarily upon republic s net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is affected by changes in the mix of the volume and rates of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following table provides an analysis of net interest income on an annualized basis  setting forth for the periods average assets  liabilities  and shareholders equity  interest income earned on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  average yields earned on interest earning assets and average rates on interest bearing liabilities  and republic s net interest margin net interest income as a percentage of average total inte rest earning assets

net interest income and net interest margin are presented on a tax equivalent basis 
net interest income has been increased over the financial statement amount by  and in  and  respectively  to adjust for tax equivalency 
the tax equivalent net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax equivalent net interest income by average total interest earning assets 
rate volume analysis of changes in net interest income net interest income may also be analyzed by segregating the volume and rate components of interest income and interest expense 
the following table sets forth an analysis of volume and rate changes in net interest income for the periods indicated

tax equivalent net interest income increased million  or  to million for  as compared to million for the increase in net interest income was due primarily to a basis point decrease in the cost of interest bearing deposits 
average interest bearing liabilities amounted to million for and million for  and the total interest expense decreased million  or  to million for  from million in  primarily the result of lowering our cost of funds on money market  savings and time deposits as a result of our retail focused  customer service strategy which includes the gathering of low cost core deposits 
total tax equivalent interest income decreased million  or  to million for  from million for interest and fees on loans decreased million  or  to million for  from million for the decrease was due primarily to a million decrease in average loans receivable due to our intentional efforts to reduce exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio

interest expense on other borrowings includes the impact of million of average trust preferred securities 
we intentionally reduced our dependence on short term borrowings during provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is charged to operations in an amount necessary to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level that reflects the known losses and adequate to absorb estimated inherent losses in the portfolio 
the provision for loan losses amounted to million during compared to million for the comparable prior year period 
the million provision recorded in was primarily driven by a comprehensive internal  external and regulatory review of our loan portfolio 
as a result of these reviews  management determined that an increased provision would be required 
the increase from the comparable prior year period was primarily due to the continued decline of collateral values within our commercial real estate portfolio due to the challenging economic environment as we took actions to reduce exposure levels throughout the year 
non interest income total non interest income increased to million for compared to  for  primarily due to a decrease of million in impairment charges on bank pooled trust preferred securities held in our investment portfolio and a million gain on sale of investment securities during we believe the reduction in impairment charges on our bank pooled trust preferred securities will continue in and after 
during  we capitalized on an opportunity to recognize available gains on the sale of certain investment securities 
non interest expenses total non interest expenses increased million  or to million for compared to million for occupancy expense increased to million in  compared to million for primarily as a result of the write off of future site development costs associated with the termination of the merger agreement with metro bancorp  inc in march legal fees increased to million in  compared to million in mainly due to an increase in loan workouts as well as fees that were incurred as a result of the termination of the merger agreement with metro bancorp  inc other real estate expenses increased to  in  compared to  in  primarily due to an increase in property maintenance expenses on foreclosed properties 
provision for income taxes the benefit for income taxes generated by our net operating losses remained consistent at million for  as compared to million for the effective tax rates in those periods were and  respectively 
results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  overview we had a net loss of million or per diluted share during  compared to a net loss of  or per diluted share during during  there was a million  or  decrease in total interest income  due to a basis point decrease in the yield on average loans outstanding  while interest expense decreased by million  reflecting a basis point decrease in the rate on average interest bearing deposits outstanding 
accordingly  net interest income decreased million during the provision for loan losses in increased to million  compared to million for  driven by additional reserves on certain loans as we continued to deal with the impact of the challenging economic environment 
non interest income decreased million to  in  compared to million in  primarily due to impairment charges on investment securities 
non interest expenses increased million to million in compared to million in  primarily due to activities surrounding the anticipated closing of the metro merger as salaries and employee benefit expense increased by million and consulting fees increased by million 
in addition  regulatory assessments and costs increased by million due to actions taken by the fdic coupled with strong growth in core deposits

average other borrowings  primarily overnight fhlb borrowings  decreased million  or  during interest expense on other borrowings includes the impact of million of average trust preferred securities and million of fhlb term borrowings 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is charged to operations in an amount necessary to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level that reflects the known losses and adequate estimate to absorb inherent losses in the portfolio 
the provision for loan losses amounted to million during compared to million for the million provision recorded in was primarily driven by a comprehensive internal  external and regulatory review of our loan portfolio 
as a result of these reviews  management determined that an increased provision would be required 
the significant increase from was primarily due to the continued decline of collateral values within our commercial real estate portfolio and a change in our methodology for calculating potential loan losses inherent in its loan portfolio  coupled with a more conservative loan classification system 
during  as a result of the above items  loan specific reserves were increased to million representing of the overall allowance for loan losses 
non interest income total non interest income decreased million to  during as compared to million during  primarily due to an increase of million in impairment charges on bank pooled trust preferred securities held in our investment portfolio 
during the second quarter of  we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment in the amount of million to reclassify the non credit component of previously recognized impairment on one of these securities in accordance with accounting guidance issued in april under asc refer to the recent accounting pronouncements discussion  found under note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the reclassification resulted in an adjustment between retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet 
this impairment had previously been recognized as a reduction to earnings during the fourth quarter of due to further deterioration of the underlying collateral of the pooled trust preferred securities  we again recognized an other than temporary impairment charge of million related to the same security during the fourth quarter of without the ability to re state prior year results according to the accounting guidance 
non interest expenses total non interest expenses increased million  or to million for compared to million for salaries and employee benefits increased million  or  to million for as a result annual merit increases and higher medical insurance premiums 
in addition  we continued to add staff in anticipation of the closing of the proposed metro merger 
occupancy expense increased to million in  compared to million for due to higher maintenance costs and incremental rent increases at several store locations  as well as the corporate headquarters 
professional fees increased to million in  compared to million in mainly due to an increase in consulting fees driven by activities surrounding the anticipated closing of the proposed metro merger 
r egulatory assessments and costs increased to million for from million in  as a result of increases in statutory fdic insurance rates along with a one time special assessment paid during the third quarter of provision for income taxes the benefit for income taxes generated by our net operating losses increased to million for  compared to  for the effective tax rates in those periods were and a benefit  respectively 
financial condition december  compared to december  total assets decreased million to million at december   compared to billion at december  this decrease was primarily driven by a million decrease in net loans receivable and a million decrease in investment securities 
loans the loan portfolio  which represents our largest asset  is our most significant source of interest income 
our lending strategy is to focus on small and medium sized businesses and professionals that seek highly personalized banking services 
the loan portfolio consists of secured and unsecured commercial loans including commercial real estate  construction loans  residential mortgages  automobile loans  home improvement loans  home equity loans and lines of credit  overdraft lines of credit and others 
total gross loans decreased million  or  to million at december   versus million at december  this decrease is reflective of our continuing effort to reduce exposure to decline in value of commercial real estate and strengthen the credit quality of the loan portfolio 
republic  s commercial loans typically range between  and  but customers may borrow significantly larger amounts up to republic s legal lending limit of approximately million at december  loans made to an individual customer  even if secured by different collateral  are aggregated for purposes of the lending limit 
the aggregate amount of those relationships that exceeded million at december   was million 
the million threshold approximates of total regulatory capital and reflects an additional internal monitoring guideline 
investment securities investment securities considered available for sale are investments that may be sold in response to changing market and interest rate conditions and for liquidity and other purposes 
our investment securities classified as available for sale consist primarily of us government agency issued mortgage backed securities which include collateralized mortgage obligations cmos  municipal securities and debt securities  which include corporate bonds and trust preferred securities 
available for sale securities totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from year end  due to the maturity or call of certain investment securities  as well as sales of investments securities in order to recognize gains that most likely would not exist in a rising rate environment 
at dec ember   the portfolio had a net unrealized loss of million  compared to a net unrealized loss of million at december investment securities considered held to maturity are investments for which there is the intent and ability to hold the investment to maturity 
these investments are carried at amortized cost 
the held to maturity portfolio consists primarily of debt securities and stocks 
at december   securities held to maturity totaled  which was comparable to the  at year end at both dates  respective carrying values approximated market values 
restricted stock republic is required to maintain fhlb stock in proportion to its outstanding debt to fhlb 
when the debt is repaid  the purchase price of the stock is refunded 
at december  and  fhlb stock totaled million and million  respectively 
republic is also required to maintain stock in atlantic central bankers bank acbb as a condition of a contingency line of credit 
at december  and  acbb stock totaled  cash and cash equivalents cash and due from banks  interest bearing deposits and federal funds sold comprise this category  which consists of our most liquid assets 
the aggregate amount in these three categories decreased by million  to million at december   from million at december   reflecting a million decrease in federal funds sold and a million decrease in interest bearing deposits 
fixed assets bank premises and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  totaled million at december   an increase of million from million at december  this increase was mainly due to the capital expenses related to opening the new haddonfield store location in southern new jersey in july other real estate owned the balance of other real estate owned increased to million at december  from million at december   primarily reflecting two transfers related to non performing loans of million  partially offset by proceeds of sales totaling million and write downs totaling million 
we continue to actively pursue resolutions related to all non performing assets 
bank owned life insurance at december   the value of the insurance was million  which was an increase of  from million at december  the slight increase reflected income earned on the insurance policies 
other assets other assets slightly decreased by  to million at december   from million at december  deposits deposits  which include non interest and interest bearing demand deposits  money market  savings and time deposits including some brokered deposits  are republic s major source of funding 
deposits are generally solicited from our market area through the offering of a variety of products to attract and retain customers  with a primary focus on multi product relationships 
total deposits decreased by million to million at december   from million at december  which was mainly due to the intentional decision to reduce our dependency on the more volatile sources of funding such as brokered deposits and public fund certificates of deposit 
short term borrowings and fhlb advances republic had no fhlb advances outstanding as of december  and million outstanding at december   which matured in june republic also had no short term borrowings overnight at december  or as we reduced our dependence on outside borrowings and focused on low cost core deposit funding sources 
shareholders equity total shareholders equity increased million to million at december   versus million at december   primarily due to million of net proceeds from the common stock offering that was partially offset by a million net loss recorded during investment securities portfolio republic s investment securities portfolio is intended to provide liquidity and contribute to earnings while diversifying credit risk 
we attempt to maximize earnings while minimizing our exposure to interest rate risk 
the securities portfolio consists primarily of us government agency issued mortgage backed securities which include collateralized mortgage obligations cmos  municipal securities  corporate bonds and trust preferred securities 
our alco committee monitors and approves all security purchases 
the decrease in the total amortized cost of securities in was driven by the early call of two agency bonds and the sale of certain mortgage backed securities during the fourth quarter of a summary of investment securities available for sale and investment securities held to maturity at december   and is as follows dollars in thousands at december  available for sale mortgage back securities cmos municipal securities corporate bonds agency bonds trust preferred securities other securities total amortized cost of securities total fair value of investment securities held to maturity us government agencies mortgage back securities cmos municipal securities other securities total amortized cost of securities total fair value of investment securities no single issuer of securities excluding government agencies account for more than of shareholders equity 
at december   the portfolio included municipal securities with a market value of million 
the securities are reviewed quarterly for impairment 
research on each issuer is completed to ensure the financial stability of the municipal entity 
the largest geographic concentration was in california where municipal securities had a market value of million 
there were no defaults by any moody s rated state or local government in as of december   there was no impairment on any municipal securities

for certain securities which are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions  valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and or non transferability  and such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence level 
in the absence of such evidence  management s best estimate is used 
management s best estimate consists of both internal and external support on certain level investments 
internal cash flow models using a present value formula that includes assumptions market participants would use along with indicative exit pricing obtained from broker dealers where available were used to support fair values of certain level investments 
the types of instruments valued based on matrix pricing in active markets include all of the us government and agency securities  municipal obligations and corporate bonds 
such instruments are generally classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
as required by asc  we do not adjust the matrix pricing for such instruments 
level is for positions that are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions  and may be adjusted to reflect illiquidity and or non transferability  with such adjustment generally based on available market evidence 
in the absence of such evidence  management s best estimate is used 
subsequent to inception  management only changes level inputs and assumptions when corroborated by evidence such as transactions in similar instruments  completed or pending third party transactions in the underlying investment or comparable entities  subsequent rounds of financing  recapitalizations and other transactions across the capital structure  offerings in the equity or debt markets  and changes in financial ratios or cash flows 
the level investment securities classified as available for sale are primarily com prised of various issues of bank pooled trust preferred securities and a corporate bond 
bank pooled trust preferred securities consist of the debt instruments of various banks  diversified by the number of participants in the security as well as geographically 
the securities are performing according to terms  however the secondary market for such securities has become inactive  and such securities are therefore classified as level securities 
the fair value analysis does not reflect or represent the actual terms or prices at which any party could purchase the securities 
there is currently no secondary market for the securities and there can be no assurance that any secondary market for the securities will develop 
the following table presents a reconciliation of the securities available for sale measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs level for the year ended december  and dollars in thousands beginning balance  january security transferred to level measurements unrealized losses gains impairment charge on level securities adjustment for non credit component of previously recognized otti other  including proceeds from calls of investment securities ending balance  december a third party pricing service was used in the development of the fair market valuation for the bank pooled trust preferred securities 
the calculations used to determine fair value are based on the attributes of the bank pooled trust preferred securities  the financial condition of the issuers of the bank pooled trust preferred securities  and market based assumptions 
the intex desktop valuation model was utilized to obtain information regarding the attributes of each security and its specific collateral as of december  and financial information on the issuers was also obtained from bloomberg  the fdic and the office of thrift supervision 
both published and unpublished industry sources were utilized in estimating fair value 
such information includes loan prepayment speed assumptions  discount rates  default rates  and loss severity percentages 
due to the current state of the global capital and financial markets  the fair market valuation is subject to greater uncertainty that would otherwise exist 
fair market valuation for each security was determined based on discounted cash flow analyses 
the cash flows are primarily dependent on the estimated speeds at which the bank pooled trust preferred securities are expected to prepay  the estimated rates at which the bank pooled trust preferred securities are expected to defer payments  the estimated rates at which the bank pooled trust preferred securities are expected to default  and the severity of the losses on securities that do default 
prepayment assumptions 
trust preferred securities generally allow for prepayments without a prepayment penalty any time after years 
due to the lack of new bank pooled trust preferred issuances and the relativity poor conditions of the financial institution industry  the rate of voluntary prepayments are estimated at 
prepayments affect the securities in three ways 
first  prepayments lower the absolute amount of excess spread  an important credit enhancement 
second  the prepayments are directed to the senior tranches  the effect of which is to increase the overcollateralization of the mezzanine layer  the layer at which the company is located in each of the securities 
however  the prepayments can lead to adverse selection in which the strongest institutions have prepaid  leaving the weaker institutions in the pool  thus mitigating the effect of the increased overcollateralization 
third  prepayments can limit the numeric and geographic diversity of the pool  leading to concentration risks 
deferral and default rates 
bank pooled trust preferred securities include a provision that allows the issuing bank to defer interest payments for up to five years 
the estimates for the rates of deferral are based on the financial condition of the trust preferred issuers in the pool 
estimates for the conditional default rates are based on the bank pooled trust preferred securities themselves as well as the financial condition of the trust preferred issuers in the pool 
estimates for the near term rates of deferral and conditional default are based on key financial ratios relating to the financial institutions capitalization  asset quality  profitability and liquidity 
each bank in each security is evaluated based on ratings from outside services including standard poors  moodys  fitch  bankrate 
com and the street 
com 
recent stock price information is also considered  as well as the week high and low  for each bank in each security 
also  the receipt of tarp funding is considered  and if so  the amount 
finally  each bank s ability to generate capital internally or externally  which is predictive of a troubled bank s ability to recover  is considered 
estimates for longer term rates of deferral and defaults are based on historical averages from a research report issued by salomon smith barney in default is defined as any instance when a regulator takes an active role in a bank s operations under a supervisory action 
this definition of default is distinct from failure 
a bank is considered to have defaulted if it falls below minimum capital requirements or becomes subject to regulatory actions including a written agreement  or a cease and desist order 
the rates of deferral and conditional default are estimated at 
loss severity 
the fact that an issuer defaults on a loan  does not necessarily mean that the investor will lose all of their investment 
thus  it is important to understand not only the default assumption  but also the expected loss given a default  or the loss severity assumption 
both standard poors and moody s analytics have performed and published research that indicates that recoveries on trust preferred securities are low less than

the major ratings agencies have recently been cutting the ratings on various trust preferred securities bond waterfall 
the bank pooled trust preferred securities have several tranches senior tranches  mezzanine tranches and the residual or income tranches 
we invested in the mezzanine tranches for all of the pooled trust preferred securities 
the senior and mezzanine tranches were overcollateralized at issuance  meaning that the par value of the underlying collateral was more than the balance issued on the tranches 
the terms generally provide that if the performing collateral balances fall below certain triggers  then income is diverted from the residual tranches to pay the senior and mezzanine tranches 
however  if significant deferrals occur  income could also be diverted from the mezzanine tranches to pay the senior tranches 
the intex desktop model calculates collateral cash flows based on the attributes of the trust preferred securities as of the collateral cut off date of december  and certain valuation input assumptions for the underlying collateral 
allocations of the cash flows to securities are based on the overcollateralization and interest coverage tests triggers  events of default and liquidation  deferrals of interest  mandatory auction calls  optional redemptions and any interest rate hedge agreements 
internal rate of return 
internal rates of return are the pre tax yield rates used to discount the future cash flow stream expected from the collateral cash flow 
the marketplace for the bank pooled trust preferred securities at december  and december  was not active 
this is evidenced by a significant widening of the bid ask spreads the markets in which the bank pooled trust preferred securities trade and then by a significant decrease in the volume of trades relative to historical levels 
the new issue market is also inactive and few new trust preferred securities have been issued since asc provides guidance on the discount rates to be used when a market is not active 
the discount rate should take into account the time value of money  price for bearing the uncertainty in the cash flows and other case specific factors that would be considered by market participants  including a liquidity adjustment

loan portfolio our loan portfolio consists of secured and unsecured commercial loans including commercial real estate loans  loans secured by one to four family residential property  commercial construction and residential construction loans as well as residential mortgages  home equity loans and other consumer loans 
commercial loans are primarily secured term loans made to small to medium sized businesses and professionals for working capital  asset acquisition and other purposes 
commercial loans are originated as either fixed or variable rate loans with typical terms of to years 
republic s commercial loans typically range between  and million but customers may borrow significantly larger amounts up to republic s legal lending limit of approximately million at december  individual customers may have se veral loans often secured by different collateral 
such relationships in excess of million an internal monitoring guideline which approximates of capital and reserves at december   amounted to million 
there were no loans in excess of the legal lending limit at december  the majority of loans outstanding are with borrowers in our marketplace  philadelphia and surrounding suburbs  including southern new jersey 
in addition  we have loans to customers whose assets and businesses are concentrated in real estate 
repayment of our loans is in part dependent upon general economic conditions affecting our market place and specific industries 
we evaluate each customer s credit worthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer 
collateral varies but primarily includes residential  commercial and income producing properties 
at december   we had no foreign loans and no loan concentrations exceeding of total loans except for credits extended to lessors of nonresidential real estate in the aggregate amount of million  which represented of gross loans receivable at december  and lessors of residential real estate in the aggregate amount of million  which represented of gross loans receivable at december  loan concentrations are considered to exist when amounts are loaned to multiple numbers of borrowers engaged in similar activities that management believes would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions 
total loans decreased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  this decrease is a direct result of our ongoing effort to reduce exposure related to the high concentration of loans in the commercial real estate portfolio through normal paydowns  early pay offs  and participations with other financial institutions 
specific focus was placed upon reduction of the outstanding amounts within the construction and land development category

a committee consisting of senior management and certain members of the board of directors oversees the loan approval process to monitor that proper standards are maintained  while approving the majority of commercial loans 
loans  including impaired loans  are generally classified as non accrual if they are past due as to maturity or payment of interest or principal for a period of more than days  unless such loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
loans that are on a current payment status or past due less than days may also be classified as non accrual if repayment in full of principal and or interest is in doubt 
loans may be returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured of repayment within an acceptable period of time  and there is a sustained period of repayment performance by the borrower  in accordance with the contractual terms 
while a loan is classified as non accrual or as an impaired loan and the future collectability of the recorded loan balance is doubtful  collections of interest and principal are generally applied as a reduction to principal outstanding 
when the future collectibility of the recorded loan balance is expected  interest income may be recognized on a cash basis 
for non accrual loans  which have been partially charged off  recognition of interest on a cash basis is limited to that which would have been recognized on the recorded loan balance at the contractual interest rate 
cash interest receipts in excess of that amount are recorded as recoveries to the allowance for loan losses until prior charge offs have been fully recovered

non performing assets are composed of non performing loans and other real estate owned 
non accrual loans increased million  to million at december   from million at december  problem loans consist of loans that are included in performing loans  but for which potential credit problems of the borrowers have caused management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to continue to comply with present repayment terms 
at december   all identified problem loans are included in the preceding table  or are internally classified with a specific reserve allocation in the allowance for loan losses see allowance for loan losses

the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non performing loans was at december  coverage is considered adequate by management as of december  and is consistent with december  and the provision for loan losses is charged to operations in an amount necessary to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level that management believes is adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses amounted to million in and million in the provisions recorded in and were primarily driven by the negative impact of the challenging economic environment as well as declining collateral values and increased delinquencies 
the company continues to examine and monitor all aspects of the loss portfolio to assure that credit quality issues have been appropriately addressed 
a significant portion of the provision recorded in included approximately million which was the result of a strategy that the company ha d elected to employ with five lending relationships 
each of these relationships involves loans for development projects classified in the commercial real estate loan portfolio 
these five relationships include the construction or refurbishment of existing properties into residential or commercial condominium units 
the projects are in varying stages of development ranging from initial start up to nearly complete 
due to reduced demand in the condominium marketplace  some borrowers have elected to lease completed units to generate cash flow 
under these circumstances certain loans could have been restructured to maintain a performing status 
however  the company has chosen to enforce the existing terms of these loans and actively pursue resolution to the significant credit concerns in the existing loan portfolio 
the company believes that this will minimize the potential for future additional losses that would have resulted if aggre ssive action had not been taken 
management makes at least a quarterly determination as to an appropriate provision from earnings to maintain an allowance for loan losses that it determines is adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
the board of directors periodically reviews the status of all non accrual and impaired loans and loans classified by republic s regulators or internal loan review officer  who reviews both the loan portfolio and overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the board of directors also considers specific loans  pools of similar loans  historical charge off activity  economic conditions and other relevant factors in reviewing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
any additions deemed necessary to the allowance for loan losses are charged to operating expenses 
we have an existing loan review program  which monitors the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis 
a loan review officer conducts this loan review on a quarterly basis and reports directly to the board of directors 
estimating the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses at any given date is difficult  particularly in a continually changing economy 
in management s opinion  the allowance for loan losses was appropriate at december  however  there can be no assurance that  if asset quality deteriorates in future periods  additions to the allowance for loan losses will not be required 
management is unable to determine in which loan category future charge offs and recoveries may occur 
the following schedule sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among various categories 
the allocation is accordingly based upon historical experience 
the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb loan losses in any loan category 
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for the years ended december     and is as follows at december  dollars in thousands amount of loans amount of loans amount of loans amount of loans amount of loans commercial construction residential real estate consumer and other unallocated total allowance for loan losses the methodology utilized to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses is as follows we first apply an estimated loss percentage against all loans that are not specifically reserved 
in  we experienced net charge offs to average loans of approximately 
net recoveries and net charge offs  respectively  to average loans were   and in   and in addition to sustained charge off history  management estimates loss percentages based upon the purpose and or collateral of various commercial loan categories 
while such loss percentages exceed the percentages suggested by historical experience longer than over the past five years  we maintained those percentages in due to the economic downturn  we will continue to evaluate these percentages and may adj ust these estimates on the basis of charge off history  economic conditions  industry experience or other relevant factors 
we also provide specific reserves for impaired loans to the extent the estimated realizable value of the underlying collateral is less than the loan balance  when the collateral is the only source of repayment 
also  we estimate and recognize reserve allocations on loans classified as internally classified accruing loans based upon any factor that might impact loss estimates 
those factors include but are not limited to the impact of economic conditions on the borrower and management s potential alternative strategies for loan or collateral disposition 
the unallocated allowance is established for losses that have not been identified through the formulaic and other specific components of the allowance as described above 
the unallocated portion is more subjective and requires a high degree of management judgment and experience 
management has id entified several factors that impact credit losses that are not considered in either the formula or the specific allowance segments 
these factors consist of macro and micro economic conditions  industry and geographic loan concentrations  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  changes in underwriting processes and trends in problem loan and loss recovery rates 
the impact of the above is considered in light of management s conclusions as to the overall adequacy of underlying collateral and other factors 
the majority of our loan portfolio represents loans made for commercial purposes  while significant amounts of residential property may serve as collateral for such loans 
we attempt to evaluate larger loans individually  on the basis of our loan review process  which scrutinizes loans on a selective basis and other available information 
even if all commercial purpose loans could be reviewed  information on potential problems might not be available 
our portfolio of loans made for purposes of financing residential mortgages and consumer loans are evaluated in groups 
at december   loans made for commercial and construction  residential mortgage and consumer purposes  respectively  amounted to million  million and million 
the recorded investment in loans that are impaired in accordance with asc totaled million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
the amounts of related valuation allowances were million  million and million respectively at those dates 
for the years ended december   and the average recorded investment in impaired loans was approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
republic earned million  million and  of interest income on impaired loans internally classified accruing loans in   and  respectively 
there were no commitments to extend credit to any borrowers with impaired loans as of the end of the periods presented herein

the amounts of related valuation were million and million respectively at those dates 
republic had delinquent loans as follows i to days past due  at december  and  in the aggregate principal amount of million and million respectively  and ii to days past due  at december  and in the aggregate principal amount of million and million respectively

republic s various deposit liabilities may fluctuate from period to period  reflecting customer behavior and strategies to optimize net interest income 
the reduction of total deposits to million at december  from million at december  was attributable to the reduction in time deposit balances 
we have intentionally reduced our dependence on the more volatile sources of funding in brokered and public fund certificates of deposit

these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
these instruments involve to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the financial statements 
credit risk is defined as the possibility of sustaining a loss due to the failure of the other parties to a financial instrument to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract 
the maximum exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments 
we use the same underwriting standards and policies in making credit commitments as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
financial instruments whose contract amounts represent potential credit risk are commitments to extend credit of approximately million and million and standby letters of credit of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
commitments often expire without being drawn upon 
the million of commitments to extend credit at december   were substantially all variable rate commitments 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and many require the payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained upon extension of credit is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer 
collateral held varies but may include real estate  marketable securities  pledged deposits  equipment and accounts receivable 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued that guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk and collateral policy involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments 
the amount of collateral obtained is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer 
collateral held varies but may include real estate  marketable securities  pledged deposits  equipment and accounts receivable

the leases are accounted for as operating leases 
the minimum rental payments required under these leases are million through the year  including renewal options 
we have entered into an employment agreement with the ceo of the company 
the aggregate commitment for future salaries and benefits under this employment agreement at december  is approximately  we have retirement plan agreements with certain directors and officers 
at december   the accrued benefits under the plan were approximately million  with a minimum age of esta blished to qualify for the payments 
interest rate risk management we attempt to manage our assets and liabilities in a manner that optimizes net interest income in a range of interest rate environments 
management uses a gap analysis and simulation models to monitor behavior of its interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
adjustments to the mix of assets and liabilities are made periodically in an effort to provide steady growth in net interest income 
management presently believes that the effect on republic of any future reduction in interest rates  reflected in lower yielding assets  could be detrimental since republic may not have the immediate ability to commensurately decrease rates on its interest bearing liabilities  primarily time deposits  other borrowings and certain transaction accounts 
an increase in interest rates could have a negative effect on republic  due to a possible lag in the re pricing of core deposits not taken into account in the static gap analysis 
interest rate risk management involves managing the extent to which interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities are matched 
we attempt to optimize net interest income while managing period to period fluctuations therein 
we typically define interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities as those that re price within one year or less 
generally  we limit long term fixed rate assets and liabilities in our efforts to manage interest rate risk 
the difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities is known as the interest sensitivity gap gap 
a positive gap occurs when interest sensitive assets exceed interest sensitive liabilities re pricing in the same time periods  and a negative gap occurs when interest sensitive liabilities exceed interest sensitive assets re pricing in the same time periods 
a negative gap ratio suggests that a financial institution may be better positioned to take advantage of declining interest rates rather than increasing interest rates  and a positive gap ratio suggests the converse 
static gap analysis describes interest rate sensitivity at a point in time 
however  it alone does not accurately measure the magnitude of changes in net interest income as changes in interest rates do not impact all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
interest rate sensitivity analysis also requires assumptions about re pricing certain categories of assets and liabilities 
for purposes of interest rate sensitivity analysis  assets and liabilities are stated at their contractual maturity  estimated likely call date  or earliest re pricing opportunity 
mortgage backed securities and amortizing loans are scheduled based on their anticipated cash flow  including prepayments based on historical data and current market trends 
savings  money market and interest bearing demand accounts do not have a stated maturity or re pricing term and can be withdrawn or re priced at any time 
management estimates the re pricing characteristics of these accounts based on historical performance and other deposit behavior assumptions 
these deposits are not considered to re price simultaneously and  accordingly  a portion of the deposits are moved into time brackets exceeding one year 
however  management may choose not to re price liabilities proportionally to changes in market interest rates  for competitive or other reasons 
shortcomings  inherent in a simplified and static gap analysis  may result in an institution with a negative gap having interest rate behavior associated with an asset sensitive balance sheet 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to re pricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
furthermore  re pricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities may vary substantially within a given time period 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayments and other cash flows could also deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating gap in the manner presented in the table on the following page 
the following tables present a summary of our interest rate sensitivity gap at december  amounts shown in the table include both estimated maturities and instruments scheduled to re price  including prime based loans 
for purposes of these tables  we have used assumptions based on industry data and historical experience to calculate the expected maturity of loans because  statistically  certain categories of loans are prepaid before their maturity date  even without regard to interest rate fluctuations 
additionally  certain prepayment assumptions were made with regard to investment securities based upon the expected prepayment of the underlying collateral of the mortgage backed securities 
the interest rate on a portion of the trust preferred securities is variable and adjusts quarterly

such estimates are necessarily arbitrary and wholly judgmental 
in addition to the gap analysis  we utilize income simulation modeling in measuring our interest rate risk and managing our interest rate sensitivity 
income simulation considers not only the impact of changing market interest rates on forecasted net interest income  but also other factors such as yield curve relationships  the volume and mix of assets and liabilities and general market conditions 
net portfolio value and net interest income analysis our interest rate sensitivity also is monitored by management through the use of models  which generate estimates of the change in its net portfolio value npv and net interest income nii over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
the npv ratio  under any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
the following table sets forth our npv as of december  and reflects the changes to npv as a result of immediate and sustained changes in interest rates as indicated dollars in thousands net portfolio value npv as a of portfolio value of assets change in interest rates in basis points rate shock amount change change npv ratio change in basis points static in addition to modeling changes in npv  we also analyze potential changes to nii for a twelve month period under rising and falling interest rate scenarios 
the following table shows the nii model as of december  dollars in thousands change in interest rates in basis points net interest income change change static the net interest income results represent a rate ramp  achieving the rate change over a month period  not an immediate and sustained rate shock 
as is the case with the gap table  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv and nii require the making of certain assumptions  which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the models presented assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or re pricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv measurements and net interest income models provide an i ndication of interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and will differ from actual results 
it is unlikely that the increases in net interest income shown in the table would occur  if deposit rates continue to lag prime rate reductions  in falling rate scenarios 
conversely  in rising rate scenarios  competitors deposit rates would be an important determinant for any increases in interest income 
management believes that the assumptions utilized in evaluating our estimated net interest income are reasonable  however  the interest rate sensitivity of our assets  liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on estimated net interest income could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from the experience on which the assumptions were based 
periodically  we may and do make significant changes to underlying assumptions  which are wholly judgmental 
prepayments on residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities have increased over historical levels due to the lower interest rate environment  and may result in reductions in margins 
capital resources we have sponsored three outstanding issues of corporation obligated mandatorily redeemable capital securities of a subsidiary trust holding solely junior subordinated debentures of the corporation more commonly known as trust preferred securities 
the subsidiary trusts are not consolidated for financial reporting purposes 
the purpose of the issuances of these securities was to increase capital 
the trust preferred securities qualify as tier capital for regulatory purposes in amounts up to of total tier capital 
on december   republic capital trust ii trust ii issued million of trust preferred securities to investors and million of common securities to us 
trust ii purchased million of our floating rate junior subordinated debentures due  and we used the proceeds to call the securities of republic capital trust i trust i 
the debentures purchased by trust ii have a variable interest rate  adjustable quarterly  at over the month libor 
we may redeem the debentures on any interest payment date on or after march  on june   we caused republic capital trust iii trust iii  to issue million of trust preferred securities to one investor and million common securities to us 
trust iii purchased million of our floating rate junior subordinated debentures due  which have a variable interest rate  adjustable quarterly  at over the month libor 
we have the ability to redeem the debentures on any interest payment date on or after september   without a prepayment penalty 
we caused republic first bancorp capital trust iv trust iv to issue million of convertible trust preferred securities on june  as part of our strategic capital plan 
the securities were purchased by investors  including vernon w 
hill  ii  founder and chairman retired of commerce bancorp  and  since the investment  a consultant to us  a family trust of harry d 
madonna  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  and theodore j 
flocco  jr  who  since the investment  has been elected to our board of directors and serves as the chairman of the audit committee 
trust iv also issued million of common securities to us 
trust iv purchased million of our fixed rate junior subordinated convertible debentures due  which pay interest at an annual rate of and are redeemable on any interest payment date a at any time on or after june  if the closing price of our common stock for trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the trading day prior to the mailing of the notice of redemption exceeds of the then applicable conversion price  or ii on or after june   without a prepayment penalty 
the trust preferred securities of trust iv are currently convertible into approximately million shares of our common stock  which is subject to customary adjustments 
on june   in an underwritten public offering we sold million shares of common stock at per share 
on july   the company sold an additional  shares of common stock also at per share when the underwriters exercised their over allotment option to purchase additional shares 
the net proceeds of approximately million from this offering are being used for general corporate purposes  including implementing the company s retail and rebranding strategies  renovating its existing stores and adding new stores 
shareholders equity as of december  totaled approximately million compared to approximately million as of december  the book value per share of our common stock decreased from as of december   based upon  shares outstanding  as adjusted for treasury stock and deferred compensation plan shares  to as of december   based upon  shares outstanding at december   as adjusted for treasury stock and deferred compensation plan shares 
regulatory capital requirements we are required to comply with certain risk based capital adequacy guidelines issued by the frb and the fdic 
the risk based capital guidelines assign varying risk weights to the individual assets held by a bank 
the guidelines also assign weights to the credit equivalent amounts of certain off balance sheet items  such as letters of credit and interest rate and currency swap contracts 
under these guidelines  banks are expected to meet a minimum target ratio for qualifying total capital to weighted risk assets of  at least one half of which is to be in the form of tier capital 
qualifying total capital is divided into two separate categories or tiers 
tier capital includes common stockholders equity  certain qualifying perpetual preferre d stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill  tier capital components limited in the aggregate to one half of total qualifying capital includes allowances for credit losses within limits  certain excess levels of perpetual preferred stock and certain types of hybrid capital instruments  subordinated debt and other preferred stock 
applying the federal guidelines  the ratio of qualifying total capital to weighted risk assets  was and at december  and  respectively  and as required by the guidelines  at least one half of the qualifying total capital consisted of tier l capital elements 
tier l risk based capital ratios on december  and were and  respectively 
at december  and  we exceeded the requirements for risk based capital adequacy under federal guidelines 
at december  and  our leverage ratio was and  respectively 
federal banking agencies impose three minimum capital requirements on republic s risk based capital ratios based on total capital  tier capital  and a leverage capital ratio 
the risk based capital ratios measure the adequacy of a bank s capital against the riskiness of its assets and off balance sheet activities 
failure to maintain adequate capital is a basis for prompt corrective action or other regulatory enforcement action 
in assessing a bank s capital adequacy  regulators also consider other factors such as interest rate risk exposure  liquidity  funding and market risks  quality and level or earnings  concentrations of credit  quality of loans and investments  risks of any nontraditional activities  effectiveness of bank policies  and management s overall ability to monitor and control r isks 
under fdic regulations  a bank is deemed to be well capitalized when it has a leverage ratio tier l capital to total assets of at least  a tier l capital to weighted risk assets ratio of at least  and a total capital to weighted risk assets ratio of at least 
at december  and  republic was considered well capitalized under fdic regulations 
the following table presents our regulatory capital ratios at december  and actual for capital adequacy purposes to be well capitalized under regulatory capital guidelines dollars in thousands amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio december  total risk based capital republic company tier risk based capital republic company tier leverage capital republic company december  total risk based capital republic company tier risk based capital republic company tier leverage capital republic company management believes that the company and republic met  as of december  and  all capital adequacy requirements to which we are subject 
in the current year  the fdic categorized republic as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action provisions of the federal deposit insurance act 
there are no calculations or events since that notification  which management believes would have changed republic s category 
the company and republic s ability to maintain the required levels of capital is substantially dependent upon the success of their capital and business plans  the impact of future economic events on republic s loan customers and republic s ability to manage its interest rate risk  growth and other operating expenses 
liquidity a financial institution must maintain and manage liquidity to ensure it has the ability to meet its financial obligations 
these obligations include the payment of deposits on demand or at their contractual maturity  the repayment of borrowings as they mature  the payment of lease obligations as they become due  the ability to fund new and existing loans and other funding commitments  and the ability to take advantage of new business opportunities 
liquidity needs can be met by either reducing assets or increasing liabilities 
the most liquid assets consist of cash  amounts due from banks and federal funds sold 
regulatory authorities require us to maintain certain liquidity ratios in order for funds to be available to satisfy commitments to borrowers and the demands of depositors 
in response to these requirements  we have formed an asset liability committee alco  comprised of certain members of republic s board of directors and senior management to monitor such ratios 
the alco committee is responsible for managing the liquidity position and interest sensitivity 
that committee s primary objective is to maximize net interest income while configuring republic s interest sensitive assets and liabilities to manage interest rate risk and provide adequate liquidity for projected needs 
the alco committee meets on a quarterly basis or more frequently if deemed necessary 
our target and actual liquidity levels are determined by comparisons of the estimated repayment and marketability of interest earning assets with projected future outflows of deposits and other liabilities 
our most liquid assets  comprised of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet  totaled million at december   compared to million at december  loan maturities and repayments are another source of asset liquidity 
at december   republic estimated that more than million of loans would mature or repay in the six month period ending june  additionally  the majority of its investment securities are available to satisfy liquidity requirements through sales on the open market or by pledging as collateral to access credit facilities 
at december   we had outstanding comm itments including unused lines of credit and letters of credit of million 
certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year totaled million at december  we anticipate that we will have sufficient funds available to meet all current commitments 
daily funding requirements have historically been satisfied by generating core deposits and certificates of deposit with competitive rates  buying federal funds or utilizing the credit facilities of the federal home loan bank system fhlb 
we have established a line of credit with the fhlb of pittsburgh 
we are required to pledge commercial real estate secured loans and residential secured loans as well as investment securities to collateralize our potential borrowing capacity which was million at december  as of december  and  we had outstanding borrowings of and million  respectively with the fhlb

we had no amounts outstanding against the acbb line of credit at december  and variable interest entities in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation asc  consolidation of variable interest entities 
asc clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which voting rights are not effective in identifying the investor with the controlling financial interest 
an entity is subject to consolidation under asc if the investors either do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  are unable to direct the entity s activities  or are not exposed to the entity s losses or entitled to its residual returns variable interest entities 
variable in terest entities within the scope of asc will be required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is determined to be the party that absorbs a majority of the entity expected losses  receives a majority of its expected returns  or both 
management previously determined that each of our current and former subsidiary trusts  trust i  trust ii  trust iii and trust iv  qualifies as a variable interest entity under asc trust i originally issued mandatorily redeemable preferred stock to investors and loaned the proceeds to us 
the securities were subsequently refinanced via a call during from proceeds of an issuance by trust ii 
trust ii holds  as its sole asset  subordinated debentures issued by us in we issued an additional million of pooled trust preferred securities in june trust iii holds  as its sole asset  subordinated debentures issued by us in in june  we issued an additional million of convertible trust preferred securities 
trust iv hold s as its sole asset  subordinated debentures issued by us in we do not consolidate our subsidiary trusts 
asc precludes consideration of the call option embedded in the preferred stock when determining if we have the right to a majority of the trust s expected residual returns 
the non consolidation results in the investment in the common securities of the trust to be included in other assets with a corresponding increase in outstanding debt of  in addition  the income received on our investment in the common securities of the trusts is included in other income 
the adoption of asc did not have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations 
the federal reserve has issued final guidance on the regulatory capital treatment for the trust preferred securities issued by the capital trusts as a result of the adoption of asc the final rule would retai n the current maximum percentage of total capital permitted for trust preferred securities at  but would enact other changes to the rules governing trust preferred securities that affect their use as part of the collection of entities known as restricted core capital elements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r which was codified into asc sfas no 
seeks to improve financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities by addressing the effects on certain provisions of fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  as a result of the elimination of the qualifying special purpose entity concept in sfas no 
 and constituent concerns about the application of certain key provisions of interpretation r  including those in which the accounting and disclosures under the interpretation do not always provide timely and useful infor mation about an enterprise s involvement in a variable interest entity 
this statement was effective as of the beginning of each reporting entity s first annual reporting period that began after november   for interim periods within that first annual reporting period  and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter 
earlier application was prohibited 
the impact of adoption was not material 
effects of inflation the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
therefore  a financial institution differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
management believes that the most significant impact of inflation on financial results is our need and ability to react to changes in interest rates 
as discussed previously  management attempts to maintain an essentially balanced position between rate sensitive assets and liabilities over a one year time horizon in order to protect net interest income from being affected by wide interest rate fluctuations
