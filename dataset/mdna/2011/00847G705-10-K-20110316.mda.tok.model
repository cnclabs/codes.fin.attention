item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our current research and or development activities are focused on developing technologies and product candidates to treat cancers and infectious diseases 
since our inception in march  our activities have primarily been associated with the development of our heat shock protein technology  primarily our lead autologous cancer immunotherapies formerly referred to as oncophage  the prophage series of cancer vaccines vitespen  hsppc 
the first product derived from the prophage series of vaccines r  still referred to in russia and europe as oncophage  represents the only approved treatment for adjuvant or non metastatic renal cell carcinoma rcc  kidney cancer patients at intermediate risk for disease recurrence 
in a registry following patients from a large randomized phase trial in non metastatic rcc  patients at intermediate risk of recurrence who were in the treatment arm demonstrated an approximately percent lower risk of death compared with those in the control arm n  p  hazard ratio 
phase trials testing the prophage series candidates g and g are underway in both newly diagnosed and recurrent glioma  respectively  where promising data has been generated to date 
additional trials are planned in metastatic rcc r and metastatic melanoma m in combination with potentially synergistic therapies  as well as in pediatric neurological tumors np 
our business activities have included product research and development  intellectual property prosecution  manufacturing  regulatory and clinical affairs  corporate finance and development  market development  and support of our collaborations 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity and convertible notes  interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents  and short term investment balances  and debt provided through secured lines of credit 
we believe that  based on our current plans and activities  our working capital resources at december   anticipated revenues  and the estimated proceeds from our license  supply  and collaborative agreements will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements through we expect to attempt to raise additional funds in advance of depleting our current funds 
we may attempt to raise additional funds by licensing technologies or products to one or more collaborative partners  renegotiating third party agreements  completing an outright sale of assets  securing additional debt financing  and or selling additional equity securities 
satisfying long term liquidity needs may require the successful commercialization of our product  oncophage and or one or more partnering arrangements for oncophage  vaccines containing qs under development by our licensees  and or potentially other product candidates  each of which will require additional capital 
in april  the russian ministry of public health issued a registration certificate for the use of oncophage for the adjuvant treatment of kidney cancer patients at intermediate risk for disease recurrence and  in september  the food drug administration fda granted the necessary permission to allow for the export of oncophage from the united states for patient administration in russia 
the russian registration was our first product approval from a regulatory authority  and the first approval of a patient specific therapeutic cancer vaccine in a major market 
in october  we announced the submission of a marketing authorization application maa to the european medicines agency ema requesting conditional authorization of oncophage in earlier stage  localized kidney cancer 
on november  we announced that the committee for medicinal products for human use chmp of the ema formally adopted a negative opinion on this maa 
subsequently we withdrew our application and we have been evaluating a variety of options to potentially bring oncophage to patients and physicians globally 
although we are no longer in active discussions with a potential partner for the european market  we continue to actively seek partnership discussions for multiple products generated from our prophage series 

table of contents guidance received from past interaction with the fda indicated that an additional phase clinical study must be conducted to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of oncophage 
because the primary evidence of efficacy comes from a subgroup analysis of the pre specified primary and secondary endpoints and was not demonstrated in the intent to treat population  our phase renal cell carcinoma trial is likely not sufficient as sole support for product approval based on existing standards in the united states and potentially in other territories 
on march   we were notified by the listing qualifications staff of nasdaq the staff indicating that we are not in compliance with the bid nasdaq marketplace rule a the bid price requirement because the bid price for our common stock had closed below the minimum per share requirement for consecutive business days 
in accordance with nasdaq marketplace rule c a  we have been provided calendar days  or until august   to regain compliance with the bid price requirement 
if compliance is not demonstrated within the applicable compliance period  the staff will notify us that our securities will be delisted from the nasdaq capital market 
however  we may appeal the staff s determination to delist our securities to a hearings panel 
during any appeal process  shares of our common stock would continue to trade on the nasdaq capital market 
there can be no assurance that we will meet the requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq capital market or whether any appeal would be granted by the hearings panel

table of contents research and development programs prior to  we did not track costs on a per project basis  and therefore have estimated the allocation of our total research and development costs to our largest research and development programs for that time period 
during  these research and development programs consisted largely of our prophage series vaccines and qs  as indicated in the following table in thousands 
research and development program product year ended december  prior to total heat shock proteins for cancer prophage series vaccines heat shock proteins for infectious diseases herpv   vaccine adjuvant qs    other research and development programs total research and development expenses prior to  costs were incurred by aquila biopharmaceuticals  inc  a company we acquired in november research and development program costs include compensation and other direct costs plus an allocation of indirect costs  based on certain assumptions and our review of the status of each program 
our prophage series vaccines are in various stages of development as described below 
significant additional expenditures will be required if we start new trials  encounter delays in our programs  apply for regulatory approvals  continue development of our technologies  expand our operations  and or bring our product candidates to market 
the eventual total cost of each clinical trial is dependent on a number of factors such as trial design  length of the trial  number of clinical sites  and number of patients 
the process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for new therapeutic products is lengthy  expensive  and uncertain 
because the further development of our prophage series vaccines is subject to evaluation and uncertainty  and because herpv is an early stage clinical development candidate and generally on hold due to cost containment efforts  we are unable to reliably estimate the cost of completing our research and development programs  the timing of bringing such programs to various markets  and  therefore  when  if ever  material cash inflows are likely to commence 
programs involving qs depend on our collaborative partners or licensees successfully completing clinical trials  successfully manufacturing qs to meet demand  obtaining regulatory approvals and successfully commercializing product candidates containing qs product development portfolio prophage series of cancer vaccines we started enrolling patients in our first clinical trial studying a prophage series vaccine at memorial sloan kettering cancer center in new york  new york in november to date  we have treated nearly cancer patients in our clinical trials 
because prophage series vaccines are novel therapeutic vaccines that are patient specific  meaning derived from the patient s own tumor  they are experiencing a long development process and high development costs  either of which could delay or prevent our commercialization efforts 
for additional information regarding regulatory risks and uncertainties  please read the risks identified under part i item a 
risk factors of this annual report on form k 
we believe that the collective results from our clinical trials thus far show that the prophage series vaccines have a favorable safety profile 
we also believe that available results from clinical trials suggest that treatment with prophage series vaccines can generate immunological and anti tumor responses 

table of contents we initiated a phase  multicenter  international trial for non metastatic rcc into which the first patient was randomized in february as announced on march   the trial did not reach statistical significance in its primary endpoint of recurrence free survival in the total patient population  though a positive trend was observed 
during the protocol design process in and  key opinion leaders were consulted  and the non metastatic rcc patient population designated for enrollment in the trial was thought to be a relatively uniform group 
in  the eastern cooperative oncology group ecog initiated a trial in adjuvant rcc with sorafenib and sunitinib that stratified their patient population into intermediate risk  high risk  and very high risk recurrence categories 
using these ecog defined criteria  analysis of the intermediate risk patients of the eligible patients in the trial showed a statistically significant difference in recurrence free survival in favor of the oncophage arm 
in part because the intermediate risk category was not prospectively delineated prior to the trial s initiation  the fda has indicated that  by itself  part i of our phase clinical trial in renal cell carcinoma is not sufficient to support a biologics license application bla filing 
we opened a subsequent protocol that continued to follow patients from this trial in the format of a registry in order to collect overall survival information  as well as investigator reports of disease recurrence 
the registry  which is expected to provide additional data on the effectiveness of the vaccine  followed patients until march  an additional three years from closure of the initial trial  providing more than five years of data collection following the enrollment of the last patient in the trial 
final analysis of this data is in process 
at the american society of clinical oncology asco annual meeting  we announced results of an interim analysis from the ongoing global patient survival registry  which showed that patients with kidney cancer at intermediate risk of disease recurrence demonstrated an approximately percent lower risk of death in the treatment arm compared with the control arm n  p  hazard ratio 
in addition to the patient registry  patient enrollment has commenced into a small study in non metastatic rcc to assess immune response in the intermediate risk patient population 
the results of this study  continued data collection through the survival registry  and ongoing analysis are uncertain  and may not positively affect the acceptability of the overall results of the trial and  even if clinically meaningful  may not meet the requirements of the fda or other regulatory authorities for submission and approval of a marketing application or similar applications for product approval outside the united states 
in april  the russian ministry of public health issued a registration certificate for the use of oncophage for the treatment of kidney cancer patients at intermediate risk for disease recurrence 
because  among other things  we have limited resources and minimal sales and marketing experience  commercialization of oncophage has been slow  and only modest sales of oncophage in russia have occurred during the year ended december  the russian registration was our first product approval from a regulatory authority  and the first approval of a patient specific therapeutic cancer vaccine in a major market 
since this approval we have been focusing our efforts in russia on securing one or more distribution and or partnering arrangements and related commercialization activities 
the amount of any future revenue generated from the sale of oncophage in russia will depend on our ability to successfully execute on these efforts and identify and obtain adequate reimbursement  as well as on decisions of physicians and patients  among other factors 
furthermore  we may experience significant delays in the receipt of payment for oncophage  or an inability to collect payments at all 
in october  we announced the submission of a maa to the ema requesting conditional authorization of oncophage in earlier stage  localized kidney cancer 
on november   we announced that the chmp of the ema formally adopted a negative opinion on this maa 
subsequently we withdrew our application and have been evaluating a variety of options to potentially bring oncophage to patients and physicians globally 
although we are no longer in active discussions with a potential partner for the european market  we continue to actively seek partnership discussions for multiple products generated from our portfolio of prophage series vaccines 
a phase clinical trial with prophage series g vaccine in recurrent  high grade glioma is currently ongoing 
this study is being led by the brain tumor research center at the university of california  san francisco ucsf  with grants from the american brain tumor association and the national cancer institute 
table of contents special programs of research excellence 
phase results  presented at the society for neuro oncology annual meeting conference in november  showed that vaccination following brain cancer surgery increased overall median survival to approximately months  with four patients surviving beyond months and one patient surviving almost years 
the study also showed that all treated patients demonstrated a significant immune response after vaccination with g p and that patients with minimal residual disease at time of first vaccination n were more likely to survive beyond nine months compared with patients with significant residual disease 
the study  which is designed to enroll approximately patients  has expanded to include new york presbyterian hospital columbia university medical center and university hospitals case western reserve 
interim data was presented at the society for neuro oncology meeting in october  which showed a median survival of months in the first patients treated with g  and that to date six patients percent had survived at or beyond months 
this early data shows an improvement in overall survival over the previous long standing historical median survival of months  and is also slightly favorable to the recently reported median survival of months with avastin bevacizumab in patients with recurrent high grade glioma 
in may  data presented at the international conference on brain tumor research and therapy suggested that vaccination with this candidate may improve overall survival in patients with recurrent high grade glioma 
an overall median survival of weeks after tumor resection was observed 
approximately of the evaluable patients survived beyond weeks  and survived up to or longer than one year 
additional data from this trial will be reported by mid ucsf also initiated an additional phase clinical trial in newly diagnosed glioma testing prophage series g vaccine in combination with temodar temozolomide 
this trial is currently enrolling  with a target of patients 
based on promising trends to date  this trial is being expanded to include up to clinical sites 
qs qs stimulon adjuvant is an adjuvant  or a substance added to a vaccine or other immunotherapy  that is intended to enhance immune response 
the key licensees of qs are gsk and janssen alzheimer immunotherapy 
there are vaccines containing qs in clinical development  including four in phase testing for malaria  melanoma  non small cell lung cancer and shingles 
the first products containing qs are expected to be launched in the timeframe 
the pipeline of product candidates containing qs is extraordinarily diverse  encompassing prophylactic as well as therapeutic vaccines for infectious diseases  multiple cancer types  and alzheimer s disease 
the company does not incur clinical development costs for these products and is generally reimbursed for any related expenses by its licensees 
in return for rights to use qs  our licensees have generally agreed to pay us license fees  manufacturing payments  milestone payments  and royalties on product sales for a minimum of years after commercial launch 
in addition to our corporate licensing arrangements  we have developed a number of academic collaborations to test new vaccine concepts and products containing qs from time to time our collaborators or licensees initiate and or cease programs containing qs for example  an undisclosed infectious disease phase program was recently discontinued by one of our collaborators 
on january   we entered into an amended and restated manufacturing technology transfer and supply agreement  under which gsk has the right to manufacture all of its requirements of commercial grade qs gsk is obligated to supply us or our affiliates  licensees  or customers certain quantities of commercial grade qs for a stated period of time 
we understand that qs is a key component included in several of gsk s proprietary adjuvant systems and that a number of gsk s vaccine candidates currently under development are formulated using adjuvant systems containing qs gsk has initiated phase studies evaluating its investigational mage a antigen specific cancer immunotherapeutic containing qs in non small cell lung cancer and melanoma 
gsk has also initiated a phase clinical trial in malaria and a phase clinical trial in shingles 
revenues recognized with respect to this agreement were million for each of the years ended december  and 
table of contents elan pharmaceuticals  inc and or its affiliates elan had a commercial license for the use of qs in the research and commercialization of products 
effective september   we entered into an amended and restated license agreement amended license agreement with elan 
on september   the amended license agreement was assigned to janssen alzheimer immunotherapy 
under the terms of the amended license agreement assigned to janssen alzheimer immunotherapy  they will have the right to develop  make  have made  use  sell  offer for sale  import  and have sold  the alzheimer s disease vaccine that contains qs licensed product 
in addition  pursuant to the terms of the amended license agreement  janssen alzheimer immunotherapy has the right to manufacture all of its requirements of qs for use in the licensed product and we have no further supply obligations 
under the terms of the amended license agreement  we are entitled to receive future milestone payments and product royalties in the event of the successful development of the licensed product 
in  elan initiated a phase study of their vaccine 
revenues recognized with respect to this agreement were  in the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we have incurred annual operating losses since inception  and we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  we expect to incur significant losses over the next several years as we continue our clinical trials  apply for regulatory approvals  prepare for commercialization  and continue development of our technologies 
since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity and convertible notes  interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents  and short term investment balances  and debt provided through secured lines of credit 
from our inception through december   we have raised aggregate net proceeds of million through the sale of common and preferred stock  the exercise of stock options and warrants  proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan  and the issuance of convertible notes  and borrowed million under two credit facilities 
during february  we entered into an at the market sales agreement with mcnicoll  lewis vlak llc and wm smith co the sales agents under which we may sell an aggregate of up to million shares of our common stock from time to time through the sales agents 
to date we have issued approximately million shares of our common stock in at the market offerings through the sales agents and raised net proceeds of approximately million after deducting offering costs of approximately  as of december   we had debt outstanding of million in principal  including million in principal of our notes maturing august  and  in principal of our notes maturing february  the notes are subject to redemption at the option of the holders or us beginning february  our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments at december  were million  a decrease of million from december  based on our current plans and activities  we anticipate that our net cash burn defined as cash used in operating activities plus capital expenditures and dividend payments will be in the million range for the year ending december  in addition  we hope to generate royalties from our qs product in the timeframe 
we believe that  based on our current plans and activities  our working capital resources at december   anticipated revenues  and the estimated proceeds from our license  supply  and collaborative agreements will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements into we closely monitor our cash needs 
we continue to monitor the likelihood of success of our key initiatives and are prepared to discontinue funding of such activities if they do not prove to be commercially feasible 
in addition  we will continue to adjust other spending as needed in order to preserve liquidity 
we expect to attempt to raise additional funds in advance of depleting our current funds 
in order to fund our operations through and beyond  we will need to contain costs and raise additional funds 
we may attempt to raise additional funds by licensing technologies or products to one or more collaborative partners  renegotiating third party agreements  completing an outright sale of selected assets  securing additional debt financing  and or selling additional equity securities 
our ability to successfully enter into any such arrangements is uncertain  and if funds are not available  or not available on terms acceptable to us  we may be required to revise our planned clinical trials  other development activities  capital expenditures  and or the scale of our operations 
as noted above  we expect to attempt to raise additional funds in advance of depleting our current funds  however  we may not be able to 
table of contents raise funds or raise amounts sufficient to meet the long term needs of the business 
satisfying long term liquidity needs may require the successful commercialization of oncophage and or one or more partnering arrangements for our other prophage series vaccines  successful commercialization of vaccines containing qs under development by our licensees  and potentially successful commercialization of other product candidates  each of which will require additional capital  as discussed above 
please see the forward looking statements section and the risks highlighted under part i item a 
risk factors of this annual report on form k 
our future cash requirements include  but are not limited to  efforts to make oncophage available in russia and other jurisdictions we are currently exploring  as well as supporting our clinical trial and regulatory efforts and continuing our other research and development programs 
since inception  we have entered into various agreements with institutions and clinical research organizations to conduct and monitor our clinical studies 
under these agreements  subject to the enrollment of patients and performance by the applicable institution of certain services  we have estimated our payments to be million over the term of the studies 
through december   we have expensed million as research and development expenses and million has been paid related to these clinical studies 
the timing of expense recognition and future payments related to these agreements is subject to the enrollment of patients and performance by the applicable institution of certain services 
we have also entered into sponsored research agreements related to our product candidates that required payments of million  all of which has been paid as of december  we plan to enter into additional sponsored research agreements  and we anticipate significant additional expenditures will be required to advance our clinical trials  apply for regulatory approvals  continue development of our technologies  and bring our product candidates to market 
part of our strategy is to develop and commercialize some of our product candidates by continuing our existing collaborative arrangements with academic and collaborative partners and licensees and by entering into new collaborations 
as a result of our collaborative agreements  we will not completely control the efforts to attempt to bring those product candidates to market 
we have various agreements  for example  with collaborative partners and or licensees  which allow the use of our qs adjuvant in numerous vaccines 
these agreements grant exclusive worldwide rights in some fields of use and co exclusive or non exclusive rights in others 
these agreements generally provide us with rights to manufacture and supply qs to the collaborative partner or licensee and also call for royalties to be paid to us on future sales of licensed vaccines that include qs  which may or may not be achieved 
significant investment in manufacturing capacity could be required if we were to retain our manufacturing and supply rights 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
we continue to support and develop our qs partnering collaborations  with the goal of generating royalties from this product in the timeframe 
our future ability to generate cash from operations will depend on achieving regulatory approval of our product candidates  and market acceptance of oncophage and our product candidates  achieving benchmarks as defined in existing collaborative agreements  and our ability to enter into new collaborations

in addition to the common stock acquired by garo h 
armen and armen partners lp  each acquired an equal number of both warrants and unit warrants 
the unit warrants expired january  critical accounting policies and estimates the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require the application of management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 

table of contents the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base those estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is dictated by us generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for our judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which our judgment in selecting an available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
we have identified the following as our critical accounting policies 
share based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation  we recognize share based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation expense for those share based awards expected to vest 
compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
stock options granted to certain non employees have been accounted for based on the fair value method of accounting in accordance with asc  equity equity based payments to non employees 
as a result  the noncash charge to operations for non employee options with vesting or other performance criteria is affected each reporting period  until the non employee options vest  by changes in the fair value of our common stock 
under the provisions of asc  the change in fair value of vested options issued to non employees is reflected in the statement of operations each reporting period  until the options are exercised or expire 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards requires the use of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based awards and stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on share based compensation 
fair value accounting derivative liability as a result of the adoption of certain guidance within asc  derivatives and hedging contracts in entity s own equity  as of january   the conversion feature embedded in our notes is treated as a derivative and recorded at its fair value  with period to period changes in the fair value recorded as a gain or loss in our consolidated statement of operations 
we measure fair value based on a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available 
observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the company 
unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the company s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
our derivative liability is valued based on significant unobservable inputs 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue for services under research and development contracts are recognized as the services are performed  or as clinical trial materials are provided 
non refundable milestone payments that represent the completion of a separate earnings process are recognized as revenue when earned 
license fees and royalties are recognized as they are earned 
revenue recognized from collaborative agreements is based upon the provisions of accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb revised authoritative guidance on multiple deliverable revenue arrangements providing a greater ability to separate and allocate arrangement consideration in a multiple element revenue arrangement by requiring the use of estimated selling prices to allocate arrangement consideration if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence of selling price is available  thereby eliminating the use of the residual method of allocation 
the revised guidance also requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures surrounding multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and may be applied retrospectively or prospectively for new or materially modified arrangements 
early adoption is permitted 
we will evaluate the impact of this standard on future revenue arrangements that we may enter into 
in april  the fasb codified the consensus reached in emerging issues task force issue no

milestone method of revenue recognition  to limit the scope of this asu to research or development arrangements and require that guidance in this asu be met for an entity to apply the milestone method which allows entities to record the milestone payment in its entirety in the period achieved 
however  the fasb clarified that  even if the requirements in this asu are met  entities would not be precluded from making an accounting policy election to apply another appropriate accounting policy that results in the deferral of some portion of the arrangement consideration 
the asu was effective for periods beginning on or after june  early application was permitted

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates as we seek debt financing and invest excess cash 
we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk related to our transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not currently employ specific strategies  such as the use of derivative instruments or hedging  to manage these exposures 
our currency exposures vary  but are primarily concentrated in the euro 
during the year ended december   there has been no material change with respect to our interest rate and foreign currency exposures or our approach toward those exposures 
however  we are exploring possible commercialization of oncophage outside of the us  which could result in increased foreign currency exposure 
the information below summarizes our market risks associated with debt obligations as of december  fair value included herein has been estimated taking into consideration the nature and terms of each instrument and the prevailing economic and market conditions at december  the table presents principal payments by year of maturity based on the terms of the debt in thousands 
estimated fair value outstanding principal amount december  year of maturity long term debt fixed interest rates range from to 
the above table is based on the assumptions that future interest on the notes is paid in cash and that these notes are not converted at maturity august  in certain circumstances  the notes could be converted before then 
in addition  the table is based on the assumption that the notes are redeemed on february  in certain circumstances  the notes could be converted on or before february  the note holders of our notes can require us to redeem debt at certain dates between and if the notes are not converted and we are not required to purchase the notes  they mature on february  the estimated fair value of our long term debt was derived by evaluating the nature and terms of each note and considering the prevailing economic and market conditions at the balance sheet date 
in addition  the fair value of our notes was estimated based on the most recent market transactions 
we had cash and cash equivalents at december  of million  which are exposed to the impact of interest and foreign currency exchange rate changes  and our interest income fluctuates as interest rates change 
due to the short term nature of our investments in money market funds  our carrying value approximates the fair value of these investments at december   however  we are subject to investment risk 
we invest our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs  and maximize yields 
we review our investment policy annually and amend it as deemed necessary 
currently  the investment policy prohibits investing in any structured investment vehicles and asset backed commercial paper 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer  or type of investment 
our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration  interest rate risk is mitigated 
we do not invest in derivative financial instruments 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is currently any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item
