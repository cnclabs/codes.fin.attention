item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and projections of future events 
however  our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein as a result of the risks that we face  including but not limited to those risks stated in risk factors  or faulty assumptions on our part 
in addition  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview bluefly  inc is a leading internet retailer that sells over brands of designer apparel and accessories at discounts of up to off of retail value 
we launched our web site in september our net sales increased approximately to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  our gross profit margin percentage decreased to for the year ended december   from in the decrease in gross profit margin percentage was primarily related to our shift in our merchandise mix towards luxury and designer  and an increase in our provision for inventory obsolescence as a result of larger inventory balances necessary to support the increased sales demand in the fourth quarter of our gross profit increased by approximately to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  during  we refined our merchandising mix to shift towards more luxury designer merchandise  as compared to our focus on contemporary merchandise in which we focused on in in response to general economic conditions 
we believe this shift in resulted in an increase in the return rate  but also increased average order size 
in this respect  gross profit margin percentage for is more comparable to the gross profit margin percentage that we generated in  when our merchandise mix also shifted more towards luxury designer items 
total marketing expenses including staff related costs increased by approximately to  for the year ended december   from  for year ended december  we increased our spending in marketing excluding staff related costs by to  for the full year from  for the full year this planned increase consisted primarily of equal increases in variable costs related to online programs and fixed costs relating to offline programs of approximately 
this investment in marketing expenses reflects our efforts to drive top line growth through online and offline marketing initiatives 
marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  we incurred an operating loss of  for the year ended december   as compared to our operating loss of  for the year ended december  the increase in operating loss was primarily a result of increases in marketing expenses  which were partially offset by decreases in selling and fulfillment expenses  and general and administrative expenses 
our reserve for returns and credit card chargebacks for the year ended december  increased to compared to of gross sales for the year ended december  a portion of our inventory includes merchandise acquired on a pack and hold basis  where we either purchased with the intention of holding for the appropriate season or to take advantage of opportunities in the market 
we recorded total stock based compensation expenses of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of  the net losses and accumulated deficit resulted primarily from operating losses including  but not limited to  the costs associated with developing and marketing our web site and building our infrastructure  as well as non cash beneficial conversion charges resulting from decreases in the conversion price of our preferred stock  payment of dividends to holders of preferred stock and non cash interest expenses resulting from an embedded derivative in convertible debt 
critical accounting policies management estimates the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
significant estimates and assumptions include useful lives of property and equipment  recoverability of inventories  the realization of deferred tax assets  the adequacy of the allowances for sales returns and the calculations related to stock based compensation expense 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
in addition  we currently estimate that we will have adequate liquidity to fund operations beyond december  such estimate is based on projected revenues  expenses and timing of various payments 
should unforeseen events occur or should actual results differ from current estimates  we may be unable to meet payment obligations as they come due which would have a material adverse impact on our operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete and revenue is measurable 
gross sales consist primarily of revenue from product sales and shipping and handling charges and are net of promotional discounts 
net sales represent gross sales  less provision for returns  credit card chargebacks  and adjustments for uncollected sales taxes 
revenue is recognized when all the following criteria are met a customer executes an order 
the product price and the shipping and handling fee have been determined 
credit card authorization has occurred and collection is reasonably assured 
the product has been shipped and received by the customer 
deferred revenue  which consists primarily of goods shipped to customers but not yet received and customer credits is classified as current liabilities on our balance sheets 
shipping and handling billed to customers are classified as revenue and freight cost incurred in connection with purchasing merchandise is classified as cost of goods sold 
provision for sales returns and doubtful accounts we now permit returns for any reason within days of the sale 
accordingly  we establish a reserve for estimated future returns and bad debt at the time of shipment based primarily on historical data 
we perform credit card authorizations and check the verification of our customers prior to shipment of merchandise 
however  our future return and bad debt rates could differ from historical patterns  and  to the extent that these rates increase significantly  could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  cash flows  financial condition and results of operations 
for the years ended december   and  our returns reserves were  and  respectively  of gross sales 
actual charges have not varied materially from historical percentages 
stock based compensation authoritative guidance relating to stock based compensation requires us to measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating expected volatility  expected term  risk free interest rate and expected forfeitures 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
inventory valuation inventories  which consist of finished goods  are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
this valuation requires us to make judgments based on currently available information  about the salability of such merchandise and the selling price  among other factors 
based upon this evaluation  we review our inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and establish a reserve for such merchandise 
deferred tax valuation allowance we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted statutory rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is realized in income or loss in the period of the enactment date 
we have assessed the future taxable income and determined that a deferred tax valuation allowance is deemed necessary 
in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination is made 
authoritative guidance relating to uncertainty in income taxes prescribes a comprehensive model for the manner in which a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose in its financial statements all material uncertain tax positions that they have taken or expect to take on a tax return 
as of december  and  the only tax authorities to which we are subject to are the us federal tax authorities and various state tax authorities in the united states 
open tax years that are subject to examination by the us federal tax authorities and various state tax authorities  which extend back to  relate to years in which unused net operating losses were generated 
in the event that we conclude that we are subject to interest and or penalties arising from uncertain tax positions  we will present interest and penalties as a component of income taxes 
no amounts of interest or penalties were recognized in our balance sheets or statements of operations as of and for the years ended december  and results of operations the following table sets forth our statements of operations data for the years ended december st 
all data is in thousands except as indicated below as a of as a of as a of net sales net sales net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling and fulfillment expenses marketing expenses general and administrative expenses total operating expenses operating loss interest expense  net net loss we also measure and evaluate ourselves against certain other key operational metrics 
the following table sets forth our actual results based on these other metrics for the years ended december st  as indicated below average order size including shipping handling new customers added during the year based on unique email addresses in addition to the financial statement items and metrics listed above  which are non gaap financial measurements  we also report gross sales  another non gaap financial measurement 
we define gross sales as the total dollar amount of orders received by customers including shipping and handling net of customer credits  but before any reserves are taken for returns or bad debt 
we believe that the presentation of gross sales is useful to investors because a it provides an alternative measure of the total demand for the products sold by us and b it provides a basis upon which to measure the percentage of total demand that is reserved for both returns and bad debt 
management uses the gross sales measure for these same reasons 
for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net sales gross sales for the year ended december  increased by approximately to  from  for the year ended december  the increase in gross sales was primarily attributable to our decision to invest in inventory levels to support the growth in sales demand and our increased marketing efforts

the provision for returns and credit card chargebacks and other credits was approximately and for and  respectively  resulting in a provision of approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively
