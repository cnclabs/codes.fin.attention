overview we are the leading provider of onshore seismic data acquisition services in the lower states of the united states as measured by the number of active data acquisition crews 
substantially all of our revenues are derived from the seismic data acquisition services we provide to our clients  mainly domestic oil and natural gas companies 
demand for our services depends upon the level of spending by these companies for exploration  production  development and field management activities  which depends  in part  on oil and natural gas prices 
significant fluctuations in domestic oil and natural gas exploration activities and commodity prices have affected the demand for our services and our results of operations in years past  and such fluctuations continue to be the single most important factor affecting our business and results of operations 
beginning in august  the prices of oil and especially natural gas declined significantly from historic highs due to reduced demand from the global economic slowdown  and during many domestic oil and natural gas companies reduced their capital expenditures due to the decrease in market prices and disruptions in the credit markets 
these factors led to a severe reduction in demand for our services and in our industry during as well as downward pressure on the prices we charged our customers for our services 
in order to better align our crew capacity with reduced demand  we reduced the number of data acquisition crews we operated from sixteen in january to nine in october due to the reductions in the number of our active data acquisition crews and lower utilization rates for our remaining operating crews  we experienced a reduction in operating revenues and  to a lesser extent  in operating costs during calendar and into calendar 
table of contents beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  we began to experience an increase in demand for our services  particularly in the oil basins 
demand for our services has continued to strengthen through fiscal our order book is currently at its highest level since late fiscal in response to this demand increase  we redeployed three seismic data acquisition crews in fiscal and two seismic data acquisition crews in fiscal  bringing our current crew count to fourteen active crews 
during fiscal  we purchased  oyo gsr single channel units   oyo gsr four channel units with three component geophones and ten inova ahv iv vibrator energy source units 
these additions allowed us to deploy the two additional crews in fiscal with state of the art cable less recording equipment 
while our revenues are mainly affected by the level of client demand for our services  our revenues are also affected by the pricing for our services that we negotiate with our clients and the productivity of our data acquisition crews  including factors such as crew downtime related to inclement weather  delays in acquiring land access permits  crew repositioning or equipment failure  whether we enter into turnkey or term contracts with our clients  the number and size of crews and the number of recording channels per crew 
consequently  our efforts to negotiate favorable contract terms in our supplemental service agreements  to mitigate access permit delays and to improve overall crew productivity may contribute to growth in our revenues 
as demand for our services continues to be robust  we have been able to negotiate more favorable contract terms during fiscal and into the beginning of fiscal in addition  we believe we will complete operations by the end of calendar on several legacy contracts contracted during fiscal with less favorable terms 
during fiscal  most of our client contracts were turnkey contracts 
the percentage of revenues derived from turnkey contracts has grown in the past few years from approximately half of our revenues in fiscal to in excess of three quarters of our revenues in fiscal while turnkey contracts allow us to capitalize on improved crew productivity  we also bear more risks related to weather and crew downtime 
we expect the percentage of turnkey contracts to remain high as we continue to expand our operations in the mid continent and rocky mountain regions in which turnkey contracts are more common 
although our clients may cancel their service contracts on short notice  our current order book reflects commitment levels sufficient to maintain operation of our fourteen data acquisition crews well into fiscal over time  we have experienced continued increases in recording channel capacity on a per crew or project basis 
this increase in channel count demand is driven by client needs and is necessary in order to produce higher resolution images  increase crew efficiencies and undertake larger scale projects 
due to the increase in demand for higher channel counts  we have continued our investments in additional channels 
in response to project based channel requirements  we routinely deploy a variable number of channels on a variable number of crews in an effort to maximize asset utilization and meet client needs 
we believe we will realize the benefit of increased channel counts and flexibility of deployment through increased crew efficiencies  higher revenues and margins 
during fiscal  we purchased and leased a significant number of cable less recording channels 
we have utilized this equipment as stand alone recording systems and in conjunction with our cable based systems 
as a result of the introduction of cable less recording systems  we have realized increased crew efficiencies and increased revenue on projects using this equipment 
we believe we will experience continued demand for cable less recording systems in the future 
as we have replaced cable based recording equipment with cable less equipment on certain crews  the cable based recording equipment continues to be redeployed on existing crews as needed  including on the additional two crews fielded during the second quarter of fiscal while the markets for oil and natural gas have been very volatile and are likely to continue to be so in the future  and we can make no assurances as to future levels of domestic exploration or commodity prices  we believe opportunities exist for us to enhance our market position by responding to our clients continuing desire for higher resolution subsurface images 
if economic conditions were to weaken  our customers reduce their capital expenditures or there is a significant sustained drop in oil and natural gas prices  it would result in diminished demand for our seismic services  could cause continued downward pressure on the prices we charge and would affect our results of operations 
the majority of our crews are currently working in oil producing basins 
however  in recent years  we have experienced periods in which the services we provided were primarily to clients seeking natural gas

results of operations fiscal year ended september  versus fiscal year ended september  operating revenues 
our operating revenues increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the revenue increase in fiscal was primarily the result of an increase in active crew count during fiscal and higher utilization rates of the existing crews 
revenues in fiscal continued to include high third party charges related to the use of helicopter support services  specialized survey technologies and dynamite energy sources 
approximately one half of the increase in revenues during was due to the increase in these third party charges 
the sustained high level of these charges is driven by our continued operations in areas with limited access in the appalachian basin  oklahoma  east texas and arkansas 
we believe these third party charges  for which we are reimbursed by our clients  will decrease to a more historical level of between and of revenues as we expand our operations in the more wide open terrain of the western united states 
operating costs 
our operating expenses increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to increases in field personnel and other expenses associated with operating the additional data acquisition crews put into service during fiscal and as discussed above  reimbursed charges have a similar impact on operating costs 
general and administrative expenses were of revenues in fiscal as compared to of revenues in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased by  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the primary factors for the increase in general and administrative expenses during fiscal were increased administrative costs  primarily related to employee costs as a result of our increased crew count and operational activity  and transaction costs of  associated with the terminated merger agreement with tgc industries  inc tgc 
there was no termination fee associated with the termination of the tgc merger agreement 
we recognized  of depreciation expense in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal depreciation expense increased from fiscal to reflecting increased capital expenditures during fiscal and our depreciation expense is expected to continue to increase in fiscal as a result of our significant capital expenditures in fiscal 
table of contents our total operating costs for fiscal were  an increase of from fiscal primarily due to the factors described above 
taxes 
income tax expense was  for fiscal as compared to income tax benefit of  for fiscal the effective tax rates for the income tax provision for fiscal and were and  respectively 
our effective tax rates differ from the statutory federal rate of for certain items such as state and local taxes  non deductible expenses  expenses related to share based compensation that were not expected to result in a tax deduction and changes in reserves for uncertain tax positions 
our fiscal effective tax rate was significantly impacted by the acquisition transaction costs incurred related to the terminated transaction with tgc 
during fiscal  we made the policy decision to treat the transaction costs as permanent non deductible expenses for tax purposes 
for further discussion of the terminated merger agreement and related policy decisions  see note  subsequent events to the financial statements included herein 
fiscal year ended september  versus fiscal year ended september  operating revenues 
our operating revenues decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the revenue decrease in fiscal was primarily the result of previously announced reductions in active crew count during the second quarter of fiscal four crews  third quarter of fiscal two crews  and first quarter of one crew  a more competitive pricing environment in and substantially lower utilization rates of the remaining crews 
revenues in fiscal continued to include high third party charges related to the use of helicopter support services  specialized survey technologies and dynamite energy sources 
the sustained level of these charges is driven by our continued operations in areas with limited access in the appalachian basin  east texas and arkansas 
we are reimbursed for these charges by our clients 
operating costs 
our operating expenses decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to reductions in field personnel and other expenses associated with operating the data acquisition crews taken out of service during fiscal and as discussed above  reimbursed charges have a similar impact on operating costs 
general and administrative expenses were of revenues in fiscal as compared to of revenues in fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased by  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the primary factor in the decrease in general and administrative expenses during fiscal was a decrease in our bad debt expense 
we recognized  of depreciation expense in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal depreciation expense increased a relatively modest from fiscal to reflecting our limited maintenance capital expenditures in our total operating costs for fiscal were  a decrease of from fiscal primarily due to the factors described above 
taxes 
income tax benefit was  for fiscal as compared to income tax expense of  for fiscal the effective tax rate for the income tax provision for fiscal and was and  respectively 
our effective tax rates differ from the statutory federal rate of for certain items such as state and local taxes  non deductible expenses  expenses related to share based compensation that were not expected to result in a tax deduction and changes in reserves for uncertain tax positions 
liquidity and capital resources introduction 
our principal sources of cash are amounts earned from the seismic data acquisition services we provide to our clients 
our principal uses of cash are the amounts used to provide these services  including expenses related to our operations and acquiring new equipment 
accordingly  our cash position depends as do our revenues on the level of demand for our services 
historically  cash generated from our operations along 
table of contents with cash reserves and borrowings from commercial banks have been sufficient to fund our working capital requirements  and to some extent  our capital expenditures 
cash flows 
net cash provided by operating activities was  for fiscal and  for fiscal these amounts primarily reflect an increase in total revenues resulting from our expanded business which resulted in an increase in accounts receivable 
despite an increase in our outstanding receivables  our collection experience during the period as an average number of days in accounts receivable has remained at approximately fifty five over the last twelve months 
amounts in our trade accounts receivable that are over sixty days as of september  represent less than of our total trade accounts receivables  which is less than historical levels 
we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts of  at september  is adequate to cover exposures related to our trade account balances 
net cash used in investing activities was  in fiscal and  in fiscal during fiscal  we funded our capital expenditures primarily from  in cash generated from matured short term investments and  in proceeds from the term note used to purchase oyo gsr recording equipment as well as  of cash provided by operating activities 
in  we used cash generated from matured short term investments to fund capital expenditures 
in fiscal  we invested excess funds of  in certificates of deposit  and in fiscal  we invested  in us treasury instruments 
in fiscal  we collected proceeds from an insurance claim on our equipment burned in an october wildfire of  net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal and fiscal was  and  respectively 
in fiscal  our primary source of net cash provided by financing activities were the proceeds and subsequent principal payments for the  term note described above 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal primarily represented proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
capital expenditures 
for fiscal year  we made capital expenditures of  primarily to purchase  oyo gsr four channel units   oyo gsr single channel units  additional geophones  ten inova ahv iv vibrator energy sources units and meet necessary maintenance capital requirements 
these purchases reflect our belief that the trend towards increased channel counts and energy sources in our industry will continue 
our board of directors has approved an initial fiscal capital budget of  which will be used  in part  to purchase twelve inova ahv iv vibrator energy source units  and the remainder will be used to increase channel count  make technical improvements in various phases of our operations and meet maintenance capital requirements 
we believe that our fiscal capital investments as well as our planned fiscal capital investments will allow us to maintain our competitive position as we respond to client desire for higher resolution subsurface images 
we continually strive to supply our clients with technologically advanced d data acquisition recording services and data processing capabilities 
we maintain equipment in and out of service in anticipation of increased future demand for our services 
capital resources 
historically  we have primarily relied on cash generated from operations  cash reserves and borrowings from commercial banks to fund our working capital requirements and  to some extent  capital expenditures 
we have also funded our capital expenditures and other financing needs from time to time through public equity offerings 
our revolving line of credit loan agreement is with western national bank 
the agreement was renewed june  under the same terms as the previous agreement and permits us to borrow  repay and reborrow  from time to time until june  up to million based on the borrowing base calculation as defined in the agreement 
our obligations under this agreement are secured by a security interest in our accounts receivable  equipment and related collateral 
interest on the facility accrues at an annual rate equal to either the day london interbank offered rate libor  plus two and one quarter percent or the prime rate  minus three 
table of contents quarters percent as we direct monthly  subject to an interest rate floor of 
interest on the outstanding amount under the loan agreement is payable monthly 
the loan agreement contains customary covenants for credit facilities of this type  including limitations on disposition of assets  mergers and reorganizations 
we are also obligated to meet certain financial covenants under the loan agreement  including maintaining specified ratios with respect to cash flow coverage  current assets and liabilities and debt to tangible net worth 
we were in compliance with all covenants including specific ratios as of september  and november  and have the full line of credit available for borrowing 
we have not utilized the line of credit loan agreement during the fiscal years ended september  or on june   we exercised our purchase option for certain oyo gsr recording equipment we had been leasing 
in order to finance this purchase  we restated our credit loan agreement with western national bank to add a new term loan note term note provision  which provided  in financing for the purchase of the equipment 
the term note bears interest at an annual rate equal to either the day london interbank offered rate libor plus two and one quarter percent or the prime rate minus three quarters percent  as we direct monthly  subject to an interest rate floor of  and otherwise has the same terms as our revolving loan  except that the term note is collateralized by the oyo equipment and matures on june  the following table summarizes payments due in specific periods related to our contractual obligations with initial terms exceeding one year as of september  payments due by period in s contractual obligations total within year years years after years operating lease obligations debt obligations total on march   we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec covering the periodic offer and sale of up to million in debt securities  preferred and common stock and warrants 
the registration statement allows us to sell securities in one or more separate offerings with the size  price and terms to be determined at the time of sale 
the terms of any securities offered would be described in a related prospectus to be filed separately with the sec at the time of the offering 
the filing of the shelf registration statement will enable us to act quickly if and when opportunities arise 
we believe that our capital resources and cash flow from operations are adequate to meet our current operational needs 
we believe we will be able to finance our capital requirements through cash flow from operations  cash on hand  through borrowings under our revolving line of credit or additional equipment term loans 
however  our ability to satisfy our working capital requirements and fund future capital requirements will depend principally upon our future operating performance  which is subject to the risks inherent in our business including the demand for our seismic services from clients 
off balance sheet arrangements as of september   we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
effect of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition during the past three fiscal years 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at 
table of contents the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
because of the use of assumptions and estimates inherent in the reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
our services are provided under cancelable service contracts 
these contracts are either turnkey or term agreements 
under both types of agreements  we recognize revenues when revenue is realizable and services are performed 
services are defined as the commencement of data acquisition or processing operations 
revenues are considered realizable when earned according to the terms of the service contracts 
under turnkey agreements  revenue is recognized on a per unit of data acquired rate  as services are performed 
under term agreements  revenue is recognized on a per unit of time worked rate  as services are performed 
in the case of a cancelled service contract  we recognize revenue and bill our client for services performed up to the date of cancellation 
we also receive reimbursements for certain out of pocket expenses under the terms of our service contracts 
we record amounts billed to clients in revenue at the gross amount including out of pocket expenses that are reimbursed by the client 
in some instances  we bill clients in advance of the services performed 
in those cases  we recognize the liability as deferred revenue 
as services are performed  those deferred revenue amounts are recognized as revenue 
when it becomes evident that the estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract will exceed the total estimates of revenue to be earned  an estimated contract loss is recognized in the period in which the loss is identifiable 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we prepare our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on our review of past due accounts  our past experience of historical write offs and our current client base 
while the collectibility of outstanding client invoices is continually assessed  the inherent volatility of the energy industry s business cycle can cause swift and unpredictable changes in the financial stability of our clients 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment when triggering events occur suggesting deterioration in the assets recoverability or fair value 
recognition of an impairment charge is required if future expected undiscounted net cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets and the fair value of the assets is below the carrying value of the assets 
our forecast of future cash flows used to perform impairment analysis includes estimates of future revenues and expenses based on our anticipated future results while considering anticipated future oil and gas prices  which is fundamental in assessing demand for our services 
if the carrying amounts of the assets exceed the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows  we measure the amount of possible impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value 
property  plant and equipment 
our property  plant and equipment is capitalized at historical cost and depreciated over the useful life of the asset 
our estimation of this useful life is based on circumstances that exist in the seismic industry and information available at the time of the purchase of the asset 
as circumstances change and new information becomes available  these estimates could change 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method 
when assets are retired or otherwise disposed of  the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance sheet  and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the results of operations for the period 
tax accounting 
we account for our income taxes with the recognition of amounts of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we determine deferred taxes by identifying the types and amounts of existing temporary differences  measuring the total deferred tax asset or liability using the applicable tax rate in effect for 
table of contents the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates of deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the year of an enacted rate change 
the deferred tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our methodology for recording income taxes requires judgment regarding assumptions and the use of estimates  including determining our annual effective tax rate and the valuation of deferred tax assets  which can create a variance between actual results and estimates and could have a material impact on our provision or benefit for income taxes 
stock based compensation 
we measure all employee stock based compensation awards  which include stock options and restricted stock  using the fair value method and recognize compensation cost  net of forfeitures  in our financial statements 
we record compensation expense as operating or general and administrative expense as appropriate in the statements of operations on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the related stock options or restricted stock awards 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards  to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
asu changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances disclosure requirements  particularly for level fair value measurements 
asu will be effective in our second quarter of fiscal and will be applied prospectively 
we are currently evaluating the impact of asu and believe the adoption will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income  to require an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
asu eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity 
this update does not change what items are reported in other comprehensive income or the requirement to report reclassification of items from other comprehensive income to net income 
asu will be effective in our first quarter of fiscal  though earlier adoption is permitted 
the update will be applied retrospectively upon adoption 
we believe the adoption will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from the use of financial instruments in the ordinary course of business 
these risks arise primarily as a result of potential changes to operating concentration and credit risk and changes in interest rates 
we have not entered into any hedge arrangements  commodity swap agreements  commodity futures  options or other derivative financial instruments 
we do not currently conduct business internationally  so we are not generally subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
concentration and credit risk 
our principal market risks include fluctuations in commodity prices which affect demand for and pricing of our services and the risk related to the concentration of our clients in the oil and natural gas industry 
since all of our clients are involved in the oil and natural gas industry  there may be a positive or negative effect on our exposure to credit risk because our clients may be similarly affected by changes in economic and industry conditions 
as an example  changes to existing regulations or the adoption of new regulations may unfavorably impact us  our suppliers or our clients 
in the normal course of business  we provide credit terms to our clients 
accordingly  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients and maintain allowances for possible losses 
we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts of  at september  is adequate to cover exposures related to our trade account balances 

table of contents we generally provide services to certain key clients that account for a significant percentage of our accounts receivable at any given time 
our key clients vary over time 
we extend credit to various companies in the oil and natural gas industry  including our key clients  for the acquisition of seismic data  which results in a concentration of credit risk 
this concentration of credit risk may be affected by changes in the economic or other conditions of our key clients and may accordingly impact our overall credit risk 
if any of these significant clients were to terminate their contracts or fail to contract for our services in the future because they are acquired  alter their exploration or development strategy  or for any other reason  our results of operations could be affected 
because of the nature of our contracts and clients projects  our largest clients can change from year to year  and the largest clients in any year may not be indicative of the largest clients in any subsequent year 
interest rate risk 
we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on the outstanding indebtedness under our credit loan agreement which has variable interest rates 
amounts drawn under the revolving line of credit and equipment term note bear interest at variable rates based on the lower of the prime rate minus three quarters percent or day libor plus a margin of two and one quarter percent  subject to an interest rate floor of 
at september   we had a balance of  on our equipment term note  and no amounts were outstanding under the revolver 
we have cash in the bank which  at times  may exceed federally insured limits 
historically  we have not experienced any losses in such accounts 
recent volatility in financial markets may impact our credit risk on cash and short term investments 
at september   cash and cash equivalents totaled
