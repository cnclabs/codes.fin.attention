item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those indicated in forward looking statements 
see forward looking statements and risk factors 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing improved versions of protein drugs through internal development and external collaborations and other arrangements 
we use our directed evolution technology platform  along with ancillary technologies  and extensive protein modification expertise to pursue the creation of biosuperior proteins 
we operate substantially all of our research and development operations through perseid therapeutics llc  or perseid  a majority owned subsidiary established in september in connection with a joint venture arrangement with astellas pharma  inc  or astellas  which holds a minority investment in perseid 
perseid is focused on the discovery  research and development of multiple protein pharmaceutical programs  including ctla ig product candidates designated as our maxy program that are designed to be superior  next generation ctla ig therapeutics for the treatment of a broad array of autoimmune disorders  including rheumatoid arthritis  and transplant rejection 
under the joint venture arrangement  astellas has an option to acquire all of our ownership interest in perseid at specified exercise prices that increase each quarter from the current option price of million through march  to million over the term of the option  which expires on september  in january  astellas initiated a phase i clinical study to evaluate a maxy therapeutic designated by astellas as asp for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and potentially other autoimmune indications 
perseid earned a million payment from astellas for the achievement of this clinical milestone 
in addition to our majority ownership of perseid  our other significant programs and assets include a maxy g product candidate  which is designed to be an improved  next generation pegylated  granulocyte colony stimulating factor  or g csf  for the treatment of chemotherapy induced neutropenia  and which has potential application in the treatment of acute radiation syndrome  and approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  including million held by perseid as of such date 
we also remain eligible for a milestone payment of up to million from bayer healthcare llc  or bayer  related to the sale of our hematology assets to bayer in july the consummation of the joint venture transaction with astellas in september largely completed a multi year strategic process to position our programs and assets in collaborations and other arrangements that are primarily supported by external parties 
since then  we have focused on managing these assets and arrangements to maximize the return to our stockholders 
we expect to continue to realize value for our stockholders by focusing our efforts on the continued progress of perseid and its collaborations with astellas in an effort to increase the likelihood that astellas will exercise its option to purchase our interest in perseid 
in addition  given that we continue to have large cash reserves and a reduced ongoing financial commitment to the business contributed to perseid  we expect to consider and evaluate additional distributions to our stockholders of a portion of our cash resources in excess of our current and longer term operational requirements  although none are currently contemplated 
such distributions may be accomplished through cash dividends  stock repurchases or other mechanisms and may be fully or partially taxable depending on the circumstances of such distribution 
if appropriate opportunities become available  we may also consider and evaluate using a portion of our cash reserves to acquire additional businesses  assets  technologies  or products 
our plans with respect to any future distributions or acquisitions will be largely dependent upon the success of perseid  whether astellas 
table of contents exercises its option to purchase perseid  whether we receive the remaining milestone payment from bayer  any future developments related to the success of our maxy g program and the future financial commitments and longer term operational requirements related to these assets 
significant developments significant developments during included in january  perseid received a million milestone payment from astellas for the achievement of a preclinical milestone under its collaboration with astellas to co develop and commercialize its ctla ig therapeutics 
in january  we sold substantially all of our vaccines assets  including the related government grants  to altravax  inc  or altravax for an initial payment of  we received a second payment from altravax of  in december and altravax is obligated to pay us an additional amount of up to  by december   as the final payment of the purchase price for these assets 
in march  we repurchased  shares of our common stock from entities affiliated with glaxosmithkline plc 
for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
in may  we announced an open market stock repurchase program for the repurchase up to million of our common stock through december   and we repurchased  shares under this program during at an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
in july  perseid received another million dollar payment from astellas for the achievement of a second preclinical milestone under its collaboration agreement with astellas 
in july  our option and license agreement with cangene corporation  or cangene  under which we had granted cangene an option to obtain an exclusive license to our maxy g therapeutic for use in treating acute radiation syndrome ars  expired and we are not eligible to receive any further payments under this agreement 
in august  our license agreement with sanofi pasteur  the vaccines division of the sanofi aventis group  relating to the development by sanofi of a vaccine for the dengue virus was terminated  and we are not eligible to receive any further payments from sanofi under this agreement 
in october  we sold substantially all of the patents and other intellectual property rights associated with our molecularbreeding directed evolution platform to codexis  inc  or codexis  and cancelled all payment and potential royalty obligations of codexis to us relating to biofuels and other energy products  for million 
in december  we distributed  shares of codexis common stock  as well as approximately million in cash  by way of pro rata special distributions to our stockholders 
at present  we expect our revenues and our research and development expenses to consist primary of related party revenues and research and development expenses recognized under perseid s collaboration agreements with astellas 
we continue to maintain a strong cash position  with cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million as of december  of this amount  million is held by perseid and may only be used for perseid s operations 
for the purposes of this report  our continuing operations consist of the results of maxygen  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries  maxygen holdings us  inc  maxygen aps and maxygen holdings  inc  as well as its majority owned subsidiaries  perseid therapeutics llc  maxygen holdings llc and maxygen holdings ltd 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies  including those that reflect the more significant judgments  estimates and assumptions we make in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
variable interest entities in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued guidance that amends the evaluation criteria to identify the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
additionally  this guidance requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity 
we adopted this new guidance as of the beginning of fiscal year and have applied such guidance in evaluating whether we should continue to consolidate perseid and our other majority owned subsidiaries 
determining the primary beneficiary requires significant judgment on the part of our management and is based on an analysis of all relevant facts and circumstances  including  but not limited to our ability to direct the activities that most significantly affect the entity s economic performance  and whether we have an obligation to absorb losses or rights to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity 
based on our analysis  applying the guidance above  we have determined that we continue to be the primary beneficiary of perseid and our other majority owned subsidiaries and will continue to consolidate such subsidiaries 
at each reporting date  we will reassess whether we are still the primary beneficiary of each majority owned subsidiary 
if we determine that we are no longer the primary beneficiary  we will deconsolidate such subsidiary and record our interest at its fair market value at the date on which we deconsolidate 
we would then account for our interest using the equity accounting method 
source of revenue and revenue recognition policy we have generally recognized revenue from multiple element arrangements under collaborative research agreements  including license payments  research and development services  milestones  and royalties 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered item has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items in the arrangement 
the consideration we receive is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are considered separately for each of the separate units 
non refundable upfront payments received in connection with collaboration agreements  including license fees and technology advancement funding that is intended for the development of our core technologies  are deferred upon receipt and recognized as revenue over the period of delivery of the undelivered element  typically the relevant research and development periods specified in the agreement 
under arrangements where we expect our research and development obligations to be performed evenly over the specified period  the upfront payments are recognized on a straight line basis over the period 
under arrangements where we expect our research and development obligations to vary significantly from period to period  we recognize the upfront payments based upon the actual amount of research and development efforts incurred relative to the amount of the total expected effort to be incurred by us 
in cases where the planned levels of research services fluctuate substantially over the research term  this requires us to make critical estimates in both the remaining time period and the total expected costs of its obligations and  therefore  a change in the estimate of total costs to be incurred or in the remaining time period could have a significant impact on the revenue recognized in future periods 

table of contents revenue related to collaborative research payments from a collaborator is recognized as research services are performed over the related funding periods for each contract 
under these agreements  we are typically required to perform research and development activities as specified in the respective agreement 
generally  the payments received are not refundable and are based on a contractual cost per full time equivalent employee working on the project 
under certain collaborative research and development agreements  we and the collaborative partner may agree to share in the costs of research and development 
in periods where we incur more costs than the collaborative partner  payments from the collaborative partner are included in collaborative research and development revenues and  in periods where the collaborative partner incurs more expenses than us  our payments to the collaborative partner are included in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses including associated general and administrative expenses under the collaborative research agreements approximate or exceed the research funding revenue recognized under such agreements over the term of the respective agreements 
deferred revenue may result when we do not incur the required level of effort during a specific period in comparison to funds received under the respective contracts 
non refundable payments received relating to substantive  at risk incentive milestones  if any  are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the incentive milestone event when we have no future performance obligations related to the payment 
incentive milestone payments may be triggered either by the results of our research efforts or by events external to us  such as regulatory approval to market a product 
we are eligible to receive royalties from licensees  which are typically based on sales of licensed products to third parties 
royalties are recorded as earned in accordance with the contract terms when third party sales can be reliably measured and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of pre clinical program assets or license agreements for which no further performance obligations exist are recognized as revenue on the earlier of when payments are received or the amount can be reliably measured and collectability is reasonably assured 
accounting for clinical trial costs we charge research and development costs  including clinical study costs  to expense when incurred  consistent with applicable accounting standards 
clinical study costs have historically been a significant component of research and development expenses 
most of our clinical studies are performed by third party contract research organizations cros 
the clinical trials generally have three distinctive stages start up initial setting up of the trial  site and study management of the trial  and close down and reporting of the trial 
we review the list of expenses for the trial from the original signed agreements and categorize them according to these phases of activities of the clinical trial 
the start up activities  which include site recruitment  regulatory applications and investigator meetings  usually are performed reasonably uniformly and are performed by third party cros 
costs related to start up activities are expensed uniformly over the start up period which reflects the manner in which such costs are incurred 
the start up period is followed by the portion of the clinical trial in which patients are dosed with the drug under study and results are monitored and measured 
cros also perform this portion of the study  which comprises the major portion of the expense for conducting a clinical trial 
the major driver of expense over this phase of a trial is the number of enrolled patients undergoing treatment  and as such we calculate costs attributable to activities performed in this phase of the trial on a per patient basis  and expense those costs over the treatment phase based upon the stage of completion for each patient  as reported by the cro 
after the conclusion of the patient treatment portion of the trial there are a series of activities relating to the closedown of the study and data quality assurance and analysis 
these activities are performed reasonably uniformly and are expensed ratably over the closedown period 
other costs  such as testing and drug material costs  are expensed as incurred  which is typically when the service has been rendered or the goods delivered 

table of contents cros invoice us upon the occurrence of predetermined milestones such as the enrollment of the first patient  however  the timing of these billings and our related payments often do not correspond directly to the level of contracted activities and the incurrence by us of a liability 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  to the extent contract payments are paid in advance of the activity  they are included in prepaid assets and expensed under the policy indicated above  and to the extent that billings are in arrears to performance of the relevant activities  they are reflected as an adjustment to the liability reflected in our financials at the time of performance of the activity 
in general  our service agreements permit us to terminate at will  although we would continue to be responsible for payment of all services completed or pro rata completed at the time of notice of termination  plus any non cancellable expenses that have been entered into by the cro on our behalf 
we completed a phase iia clinical trial in december the start up activities during this trial were conducted over a period of approximately six months  the site and study management activities were conducted over a period of approximately months  and the close down activities were conducted over a period of approximately six months 
the length of future clinical trials  and the various phases of the trials  will vary depending upon the nature of the trials 
stock based compensation expense the accounting treatment for stock options  restricted stock units  restricted stock awards and shares purchased under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  requires us to recognize the fair value of the equity based awards 
in addition  we are required to recognize the fair value of our liability based awards  which as of december   consisted solely of contingent performance units  or cpus 
we estimate the fair value of stock options and espp shares using the black scholes merton valuation model and for cpus  we use a monte carlo simulation model 
these models require the input of subjective assumptions  the most significant of which are our estimates of the expected volatility of the market price of our stock  and for our cpus  the market price of codexis common stock as well  and the expected term of each award 
we estimate expected volatility based on historical volatilities 
the risk free interest rate is based on the rates paid on securities issued by the us treasury with a term approximating the expected life of the option or cpu 
the dividend yield is based on the projected annual dividend payment per share  divided by the stock price at the date of grant 
for restricted stock units and restricted stock awards  we estimate fair value based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
for stock option awards to employees in  the expected life of the stock options was calculated using the shortcut method permitted under applicable sec accounting guidance 
when establishing the expected life assumption in prior periods  we review annual historical employee exercise behavior of option grants with similar vesting periods 
due to the change in our structure and operations and the small number of individuals receiving option awards in and  we no longer consider our historical experience or that of our peers to be representative of future expected life 
therefore in  we changed to the shortcut method for establishing the expected life assumption 
for non employee awards  the expected life of the stock options was based on the life of the stock option 
the computation of the expected volatility assumption used in the black scholes merton calculations for new grants is based on historical volatilities 
the risk free interest rate is based on the rates paid on securities issued by the us treasury with a term approximating the expected life of the option 
the dividend yield is based on the projected annual dividend payment per share  divided by the stock price at the date of grant 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 

table of contents stock based compensation expense in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and was as follows in thousands year ended december  employee stock options restricted stock units restricted stock awards consultant options espp contingent performance units total stock based compensation expense in  we recorded stock compensation expense of million as part of the restructuring charge which resulted from the accelerated vesting and the extension of the exercise period of certain stock options pursuant to our retention agreement with a certain current executive and the change in control agreements with certain former executives 
restricted stock in september  we granted restricted stock awards to certain employees and members of our board of directors under the equity incentive plan  or plan  representing an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
in  we granted restricted stock awards to new employees and members of our board of directors representing an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
an exercise price and monetary payment are not required for receipt of restricted stock 
instead  consideration is furnished in the form of the participant s services to us 
all of the restricted stock awards vest over four years 
the plan and related award agreement provide for forfeiture in certain events  such as voluntary termination of employment  and for acceleration of vesting in certain events  such as termination of employment without cause or a change in control of us 
compensation cost for these awards is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant and recognized as compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
given the relative lack of sufficient history of granting restricted stock awards coupled with the fact that the number of restricted stock awards outstanding are concentrated among a few individuals  we have not applied a forfeiture discount to our stock compensation expense for restricted stock awards 
for the years ended december  and  stock based compensation expense related to the grant of restricted stock awards was allocated as follows in thousands year ended december  research and development general and administrative total stock based compensation expense contingent performance units in september  we granted cpus under the plan to all employees and board members who held options to purchase our common stock  and prospectively  we also grant cpus in connection with the grant of all new stock option awards 
cpus vest on the earliest to occur of i a change in control of maxygen  ii a corporate dissolution or liquidation of maxygen  or iii the fourth anniversary of the grant date the settlement date  generally so long as the holder continues to provide services for us on a continuous basis from the grant 
table of contents date to the settlement date 
the cpus are designed to protect holders of our stock options against a reduction in the share price of the our common stock resulting from past and potential future dividends or distributions to our stockholders  which could negatively affect outstanding options held by option holders of our stock since the options would not otherwise participate in any past or potential future dividends or distributions to the our stockholders 
the earned value of any cpu will generally be settled in shares of our common stock  but may also be settled  in part  with cash or any property distributed by us 
all unvested cpus remaining following the settlement date will expire immediately 
as a result of our distribution of  shares of codexis common stock and special cash distribution in the amount of per share in december  the value of the cpu awards became reasonably estimable for financial reporting purposes at december  we determined the fair value of the awards of approximately million at december  based on a monte carlo simulation using the following assumptions expected dividend yield risk free interest rate range expected life years expected volatility of maxygen  inc common stock to expected volatility of codexis common stock the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at each reporting date  with a term commensurate with the estimated remaining expected life of the award 
expected life is based on the remaining time to settlement for each award 
expected volatility of both our common stock and codexis common stock is based on the historical volatility  as available  of such stock commensurate for the expected life of each award 
we recognized approximately  of compensation expense in the three months ended december  related to these awards 
as the cpus are accounted for as liability awards  we will re measure their fair value at each reporting date  and will record compensation expense utilizing a straight line attribution method 
for the year ended december   stock based compensation expense related to the grant of cpus was allocated as follows in thousands year ended december  research and development general and administrative total stock based compensation expense restricted stock units during  we granted restricted stock unit awards under our plan representing an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
the restricted stock units granted represented a right to receive shares of common stock at a future date determined in accordance with the participant s award agreement 
an exercise price and monetary payment were not required for receipt of restricted stock units or the shares issued in settlement of the award 
instead  consideration was furnished in the form of the participant s services to us 
substantially all of the restricted stock units were originally scheduled to vest over two years 
however  in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by our joint venture arrangement with astellas see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  certain of these restricted stock units became fully vested on november  this did not affect the restricted stock units held by certain of our executive officers and former executive officers  who had different equity acceleration provisions in their 
table of contents employment related agreements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  we recognized a credit to stock based compensation expense of  related to the actual forfeiture rate of restricted stock units scheduled to vest in being greater than the estimated forfeiture rate for terminated employees 
at december   there was no unrecognized compensation cost related to these awards 
for the years ended december  and  stock based compensation expense related to the grant of restricted stock units was allocated as follows in thousands year ended december  research and development general and administrative total stock based compensation expense profits interest units perseid s equity incentive plan provides for the grant by perseid of profits interest units  or pius  to all employees of maxygen and perseid who are currently providing services to perseid 
a piu is a special type of limited liability company common unit that allows the recipient to participate in any future increase in the value of perseid 
the pius are designed to attract and retain employees of perseid and to provide incentive to promote the success of perseid through the advancement of the maxy program and other programs 
the earned value of a piu will generally be settled in cash 
the pius are intended to meet the definition of a profits interest under irs revenue procedure and irs revenue procedure subject to the recipient remaining an employee or service provider of perseid through each vesting date and subject to accelerated vesting  the pius will vest over four years 
the potential value of a piu  to the extent vested  will be equal to the deemed value of a perseid common unit at the time of a liquidity event  such as a buy out of maxygen s equity interest in perseid by astellas or the sale of perseid to another company  less the deemed value of a common unit at the time the piu was granted 
in the event of a buy out of maxygen s equity interest in perseid by astellas  astellas is obligated to purchase for cash all pius held by perseid s then current and former employees  consultants  directors and other service providers 
this obligation of astellas to purchase the pius is in addition to the purchase price to be paid by astellas to maxygen in exchange for its equity interest in perseid 
in the event of a liquidity event other than a buy out by astellas  such as an acquisition of perseid by another party or a dissolution of perseid  then the pius may be assumed by an acquirer  exchanged for cash at the fair market value of the pius  if any  or be replaced with other rights or property  at the discretion of the plan administrator 
under our accounting policies related to share based compensation  we have determined that the fact that the pius will only have value upon the occurrence of a liquidity event represents a performance condition 
as such  under applicable accounting standards  expense is only recognized if the performance condition is probable of occurring 
as of december   we have concluded that it is not probable that a liquidity event will occur  and as such have not recorded compensation expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
the amount of unrecognized compensation expense is approximately million as of december    of which relates to pius that have vested through december  this unrecognized compensation expense represents the implied fair value of the pius as estimated based solely on astellas exercise price for the buyout of maxygen s interest as of december  this amount will fluctuate in future periods based on the value or deemed value of perseid 
at the time we believe that a liquidity event becomes probable  as determined under applicable accounting standards  we will record a cumulative amount to compensation expense for services previously rendered 
any remaining unrecognized compensation expense would then be recognized over the then remaining service period 
also see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december   approximately million pius were outstanding 

table of contents results of operations revenues our revenues have been derived primarily from collaboration agreements  technology and license arrangements  and government research grants and from the sale of certain assets 
total revenues were million in  million in and million in as discussed further below  the increase in revenues for the period primarily reflects an increase in related party revenues received by perseid under its two collaboration agreements with astellas 
this increase was offset by a decrease in technology and license revenue from codexis and a decrease in grant revenue due to the sale of our vaccine assets and related government grants to altravax in january revenues in include the recognition of the million we received under our agreements with bayer in connection with the sale of our hematology assets and our license to bayer of the molecularbreeding directed evolution platform 
excluding revenue from the bayer transaction  total revenues increased million from to  primarily as a result of an increase in revenues received under the collaboration agreements with astellas 
technology and license revenue was million in   in and million in the technology and licensing revenue in consisted of million from the sale of our vaccine assets to altravax and the  non refundable option fee we received from cangene in  which we recognized in the third quarter of as a result of the termination of our prior option and license agreement with cangene in july technology and license revenue in consisted primarily of certain miscellaneous licensing fees received from third parties 
technology and license revenue in consisted primarily of amounts received from bayer in july in connection with the sale of our hematology assets and grant to bayer of certain licenses to the molecularbreeding directed evolution platform 
related party revenue was million in  million in and million in the million increase in related party revenue in the period includes an increase of million under perseid s two collaboration agreements with astellas  offset by a million decrease in revenues from our prior licensing agreement with codexis 
related party revenues for included a million increase in related party revenues received by perseid under its collaboration agreement with astellas for the discovery  research and preclinical development of certain protein therapeutics other than maxy  a  increase in amounts recognized with respect to the million upfront fee we received under the collaboration agreement for maxy and a decrease of million in the net reimbursements under the collaboration agreement with astellas for the maxy product candidates 
the million increase in related party revenue from to was primarily due to an increase of million in net reimbursements under the collaboration agreement with astellas for the maxy product candidates  perseid s receipt of a million milestone payment under that agreement  a million increase in amounts recognized with respect to the million upfront fee we received under that agreement  and million of revenue that was recognized under the collaboration agreement for the development of proteins other than maxy the increase in related party revenue from to also included a million increase in revenue recognized under our prior license agreement with codexis 
grant revenues were  in  million in and million in grant revenue in consisted solely of three non recurring grants received under the qualifying therapeutics discovery program  or qtdp 
the qtdp program was created by congress in march  as enacted under the patient protection and affordable care act of  and provided a tax credit or grant to eligible companies to cover certain costs and expenses in connection with qualified therapeutic discovery projects 
the decrease in grant revenue from to reflects the elimination of government research grants from the national institute of health  or nih  and the us department of defense  or dod  that were transferred to altravax as part of their acquisition of our vaccine assets in january the decrease in grant revenue from to was due to decreased external efforts on four nih grants  partially offset by increased activity on two dod grants 
external costs were passed through to each grant and recognized as revenue on a cost reimbursable basis 

table of contents we expect that our future revenues will be derived primarily from astellas under its collaboration agreements with perseid 
excluding any potential milestone payments  we expect our total revenues in to decrease somewhat compared to  primarily due to slightly lower levels of activities under perseid s collaboration agreements with astellas and the elimination of revenues under our prior license agreement with codexis 
our revenues may fluctuate substantially based on the completion of any strategic transactions or new licensing agreements and our receipt of any development related milestones  royalties and other payments under such agreements 
however  we cannot predict with any certainty whether we will enter into any strategic transaction or new licensing agreements or receive any milestone  royalty or other payments under any existing or future licensing or other agreements 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist primarily of external collaborative research expenses including contract manufacturing  contract research and clinical trial expenses  salaries and benefits  facility costs  supplies  research consultants  depreciation and stock compensation expense 
research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in the decrease in our research and development expenses in was primarily due to decreased external collaborative research costs on the maxy program  which resulted from the timing of certain manufacturing and pre clinical activities under perseid s collaboration agreements with astellas 
the decrease in our research and development expenses for the and periods was also due to reduced salaries  benefits  stock compensation and other operating expenses resulting from a reduction in headcount completed in april and the termination of a senior r d officer on october  the decrease in our research and development expenses from to was also due to the cessation of operations in denmark in the first quarter of  decreased external expenses associated with the suspended development of certain of our product candidates  including expenses related to clinical trials of our maxy g product candidates and the manufacture of maxy g and maxy vii product for clinical trials  and decreases in stock compensation expense 
stock compensation expenses included in research and development expenses decreased from million in to  in  primarily due to a reduction in domestic headcount announced in october and completed in april and the termination of a senior r d officer on october   which reduced the number of equity awards that were expensed during stock compensation expenses included in research and development expenses decreased from million in to million in  primarily due to a reduction in domestic headcount announced in october and completed in april  which reduced the number of equity awards that were expensed during we do not track fully burdened research and development costs by project 
however  we do estimate  based on full time equivalent personnel effort  the percentage of research and development efforts as measured in hours incurred  which approximates costs undertaken for projects funded by collaborators and government grants  on the one hand  and projects funded by us  on the other hand 
to approximate research and development expenses by funding category  the number of hours expended in each category has been multiplied by the approximate cost per hour of research and development effort and added to project specific external costs 
in the case where a collaborative partner is sharing the research and development costs  the expenses for that project are allocated proportionately between the collaborative projects funded by third parties and internal projects 
we believe that presenting our research and development expenses in these categories will provide our investors with meaningful information on how our resources are being used 

table of contents the following table presents our approximate research and development expenses by funding category in thousands year ended december  projects funded by third parties projects funded by related party government grants internal projects total research and development expenses related to collaborative projects funded by third parties may be less than the reported revenues due to the amortization of non refundable upfront payments  as well as a portion of the collaborative research and development revenue that is charged for general and administrative expenses 
research and development expenses in the category internal projects for the period consist of perseid s funding of the maxy program and other projects under its collaboration with astellas 
our product development programs are at an early stage and may not result in any marketed products 
product candidates that may appear promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a number of reasons 
product candidates may be found ineffective or cause harmful side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to progress through clinical trials than had been anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable costs and with acceptable quality and may be barred from commercialization if they are found to infringe or otherwise violate a third party s intellectual property rights 
in addition  competitors may develop superior competing products 
furthermore  it is uncertain which of our internally developed product candidates will be subject to future collaborative arrangements 
the participation of a collaborative partner may accelerate the time to completion and reduce the cost to us of a product candidate or it may delay the time to completion and increase the cost to us due to the alteration of our existing strategy 
the risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in the section of this report entitled item a risk factors 
because of these risks and uncertainties  we cannot predict when or whether we will successfully complete the development of any of our product candidates or the ultimate product development cost in any particular case 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase somewhat in the future based on perseid s preclinical and clinical development of maxy  the cost of which perseid will share with astellas under the related collaboration agreement between the parties and the preclinical development of other product candidates  the cost of which we expect to be funded entirely by astellas under the related collaboration agreement 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance  legal  general management  business development and human resources  insurance premiums and professional expenses  such as external expenditures for legal and accounting services  and stock compensation expense 
general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in included in general and administrative expenses were stock based compensation expenses of million in  million in and million in general and administrative expenses in also included the  transaction bonus paid to grant yonehiro  the president and chief executive officer of perseid  under his retention agreement in connection with consummation of our joint venture arrangement with astellas 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily due to decreases for legal and accounting services  external consultants and financial advisors in connection with the consummation of various strategic transactions in and decreases in salaries  benefits and stock 
table of contents compensation resulting from a reduction in headcount completed in april and the termination of two executive officers as of september  the increase in general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily due to increases for legal and accounting services  external consultants and financial advisors in connection with the consummation of various strategic transactions in  and increased stock based compensation primarily related to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock unit awards 
our general and administrative expenses during are expected to be comparable to  depending on  among other things  the levels of share based payments granted in  the use of external consultants  and expenditures for legal and accounting services 
goodwill impairment in the second quarter of  we performed an interim goodwill impairment test due to the significant decline of our stock price subsequent to the announcement on june  of certain patent matters related to our maxy g product candidate and concluded that the carrying value of the net assets exceeded our fair value  based on quoted market prices of our common stock

in addition  perseid is eligible to receive potential milestone and event based payments from astellas based on the achievement of certain events related to the development and commercialization of the maxy program 
however  there can be no assurances that either we or perseid will receive any milestone  event based payments or other proceeds under any of these agreements 
in addition  any payments related to milestones achieved under the co development and commercialization agreement between perseid and astellas for the maxy program would be paid to perseid and  as a result  such funds would not be directly available to maxygen 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities on a consolidated basis 
of this amount  million is held by perseid and may only be used for perseid s operations 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with funding expected to be received from collaborators and licensors  will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
in addition  given that we continue to have large cash reserves and a reduced ongoing financial commitment to the business contributed to perseid  our board of directors expects to consider and evaluate additional distributions to our stockholders of a portion of our cash resources in excess of our current and longer term operational requirements  although none are currently contemplated 
such distributions may be accomplished through cash dividends  stock repurchases or other mechanisms and may be fully or partially taxable depending on the circumstances of such distribution 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and the price fluctuations of certain equity securities 
to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risk  we from time to time enter into currency forward contracts 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate and market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including corporate obligations and money market funds 
at december   million of our cash and cash equivalent balance is held in us currency with the remaining  held in euros 
as of december   of our total portfolio was scheduled to mature in one year or less 
the average investment yield for our total cash and cash equivalents of million at december  was 
we did not hold derivative instruments intended to mitigate interest rate risk as of december   and we have never held such instruments in the past 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points  or  from december  levels  the fair value of our portfolio would not materially change as all of our cash and cash equivalents at december  had overnight maturities 
foreign currency exchange risk in  excluding stock compensation and restructuring charges  approximately  or million  of our operating expenses were incurred in euros  primarily for contract manufacturing 
as a result  our financial results may be affected by changes in the foreign currency exchange rates of the euro 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  we from time to time enter into cash flow hedging arrangements 
currency forward contracts are utilized in these hedging arrangements 
our hedging arrangements are intended to reduce  but may not always eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
gains and losses on these foreign currency investments are generally offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments  resulting in negligible net exposure to us on the amounts hedged 
at december   we had a forward exchange contract outstanding in the amount of  the fair value of this contract of  is recorded as a component of other accrued liabilities at december  equity price risk our exposure to changes in equity security prices relates to our ownership of codexis common stock 
at december   we owned  shares of codexis common stock and recorded the fair value for these shares of million  as determined by the closing price of such stock on december  a hypothetical change in the price of codexis common stock would cause the fair value of million reported at december  to change by  market prices for equity securities in general are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale or disposition of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee  the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions 
we do not hedge our exposure to equity security price risk
