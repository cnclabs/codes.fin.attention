item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
unless otherwise noted  all dollar amounts in tables are in millions and those relating to our results of operations are presented before taxes 
we operate two of the most recognized brands in the global vehicle rental industry through avis rent a car system  llc and budget rent a car system  inc we provide car and truck rentals and ancillary services to businesses and consumers in the united states and internationally 
we operate in the following business segments domestic car rental provides car rentals and ancillary products and services in the united states 
international car rental provides vehicle rentals and ancillary products and services primarily in argentina  australia  canada  new zealand  puerto rico and the us virgin islands 
truck rental provides truck rentals and related services to consumers and commercial users in the united states 
our revenues are derived principally from car and truck rentals in our company owned operations and include i time and mileage t m fees charged to our customers for vehicle rentals  ii reimbursement from our customers for certain operating expenses we incur  including gasoline and vehicle licensing fees  as well as airport concession fees  which we pay in exchange for the right to operate at airports and other locations  and iii sales of loss damage waivers and insurance and rentals of navigation units and other items in conjunction with vehicle rentals 
we also earn royalty revenue from certain of our licensees in the united states and internationally in conjunction with their vehicle rental transactions 
car rental volumes are closely associated with the travel industry  particularly airline passenger volumes  or enplanements 
because we operate primarily in the united states and generate a significant portion of our revenue from our on airport operations  we expect that our ability to generate revenue growth will be somewhat dependent on increases in domestic enplanements 
our ability to achieve profit margins consistent with prior periods remains dependent on our ability to successfully manage our costs and our revenues per vehicle 
our vehicle rental operations are seasonal 
historically  the third quarter of the year has been our strongest quarter due to the increased level of leisure travel and household moving activity 
any occurrence that disrupts rental activity during the third quarter could have a disproportionate adverse effect on our results of operations 
we have a partially variable cost structure and routinely adjust the size and  therefore  the cost of our rental fleet in response to fluctuations in demand 
however  certain expenses  such as rent  are fixed and cannot be reduced in response to seasonal fluctuations in our operations 
we believe that the following factors  among others  may affect and or have impacted our financial condition and results of operations domestic enplanements  which for and were lower than levels  but are expected to increase in compared to  fleet  pricing  marketing and strategic decisions made by us and by our competitors  changes in per unit car fleet costs and in conditions in the used vehicle marketplace  changes in the financial condition of vehicle manufacturers  
table of contents changes in borrowing costs and in market willingness to purchase corporate and vehicle related debt  our potential acquisition of dollar thrifty automotive group  inc dollar thrifty  changes in foreign exchange rates  and demand for truck rentals 
we believe that the economic recovery in the us and worldwide economies during favorably impacted demand for vehicle rental services  but that such demand nonetheless remained below levels seen prior to the recession 
historically  our results of operations have declined during periods of general economic weakness 
if economic conditions in the united states were to weaken  our results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted in and beyond 
in our cost reduction initiatives and restructuring activities  we are driving process improvements to reduce costs  enhance service to our customers and improve our operations 
we are pursuing an acquisition of dollar thrifty  which  if completed  could have a material impact on our operations  financial condition and liquidity 
there can be no assurances as to the timing to accomplish such acquisition or the terms thereof and the ability and timing to obtain required regulatory approval and financing and any conditions thereto 
due to uncertainties related to our business  there can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy the covenants contained in our senior credit facilities and our asset backed car rental conduit facilities 
failure to comply with such covenants could significantly impact our liquidity if we were unable to obtain an amendment or waiver or were unable to refinance or replace such facilities 
see risk factors risks related to our indebtedness 
there can also be no assurance that results will be indicative of results we will achieve in or other future periods 
results of operations discussed below are our consolidated results of operations and the results of operations for each of our reportable segments 
we measure performance using the following key operating statistics i rental days  which represents the total number of days or portion thereof a vehicle was rented  and ii t m revenue per rental day  which represents the average daily revenue we earned from rental and mileage fees charged to our customers 
our car rental operating statistics rental days and t m revenue per rental day are all calculated based on the actual rental of the vehicle during a hour period 
we believe that this methodology  while conservative  provides our management with the most relevant statistics in order to manage the business 
our calculation may not be comparable to other companies calculation of similarly titled statistics 
the reportable segments presented below represent our operating segments for which separate financial information is available and is utilized on a regular basis by our chief operating decision maker to assess performance and allocate resources 
in identifying our reportable segments  we also consider the nature of services provided by our operating segments 
management evaluates the operating results of each of our reportable segments based upon revenue and adjusted ebitda  which we define as income from continuing operations before non vehicle related depreciation and amortization  any impairment charge  non vehicle related interest and income taxes 
our presentation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

financial condition  liquidity and capital resources we present separately the financial data of our vehicle programs

our liquidity position may be negatively affected by financial market disruptions or a downturn in the us and worldwide economies  which may result in unfavorable conditions in the vehicle rental industry  in the asset backed financing market  and in the credit markets generally 
we believe these factors have affected and could affect the debt ratings assigned to us by credit rating agencies and the cost of our borrowings 
additionally  a downturn in the us economy or a disruption in the credit markets could impact our liquidity due to i decreased demand and pricing for vehicles in the used vehicle market  ii increased costs associated with  and or reduced capacity or increased collateral needs under  our financings  iii the adverse impact of vehicle manufacturers  including general motors company  ford motor company  chrysler group llc  hyundai motor america  or kia motors america  being unable or unwilling to honor its obligations to repurchase or guarantee the depreciation on the related program vehicles  iv disruption in our ability to obtain financing due to negative credit events specific to us or affecting the overall debt market  v the impact of an insolvency event or actual or potential default by any of the financial guaranty firms that have insured a portion of our outstanding vehicle backed debt and vi the effect of any of realogy  wyndham or travelport being unable or unwilling to honor its obligations under the separation agreement and the tax sharing agreement

for more information regarding guarantees and indemnifications  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
accounting policies critical accounting policies in presenting our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein 
several of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events and or events that are outside of our control 
if there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions  it could result in a material adverse impact to our consolidated results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions we used when preparing our financial statements were the most appropriate at that time 
presented below are those accounting policies that we believe require subjective and complex judgments that could potentially affect reported results 
however  our businesses operate in environments where we are paid a fee for a service performed  and therefore the results of the majority of our recurring operations are recorded in our financial statements using accounting policies that are not particularly subjective  nor complex 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
we have reviewed the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
in performing this review  we are required to make an assessment of fair value for our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
when determining fair value  we utilize various consistent assumptions  including the fair market trading price of our common stock and management s projections of future cash flows 
a change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause the fair value to be less than the respective carrying amount 
in such event  we would then be required to record a charge  which would impact earnings 
we review the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are allocated among three reporting units 
during and  there was no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets 
in  a  million charge was recorded to reflect the impairment of goodwill and the impairment of our tradenames assets 
these charges reflect the decline in their fair value below their carrying value  primarily as a result of reduced market valuations for vehicle services and other companies  as well as reduced profit forecasts due to soft economic conditions and increased financing costs 
domestic car rental operations recorded million and international car rental recorded million  for goodwill and tradename impairment  and truck rental recorded million for goodwill impairment 

table of contents vehicles 
we present vehicles at cost  net of accumulated depreciation  on the consolidated balance sheets 
we record the initial cost of the vehicle net of incentives and allowances from manufactures 
we acquire our rental vehicles either through repurchase and guaranteed depreciation programs with certain automobile manufacturers or outside of such programs 
for rental vehicles purchased under such programs  we depreciate the vehicles such that the net book value on the date of sale or return to the manufacturers is intended to equal the contractual guaranteed residual values 
for vehicles acquired outside of manufacturer repurchase and guaranteed depreciation programs  we depreciate based on the vehicles estimated residual market values and their expected dates of disposition 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent results of operations 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes 
currently we do not record valuation allowances on the majority of our tax loss carryforwards as there are adequate deferred tax liabilities that could be realized within the carryforward period 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and to record the related assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
pursuant to the tax sharing agreement entered into in connection with the separation and the separation agreement  we are entitled to indemnification for non avis budget car rental tax contingencies for taxable periods prior to and including the separation 
the rules governing taxation are complex and subject to varying interpretations 
therefore  our tax accruals reflect a series of complex judgments about future events and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions 
although we believe the estimates and assumptions supporting our tax accruals are reasonable  the potential result of an audit or litigation related to tax could include a range of outcomes  and could result in tax liabilities for the company that are materially different than those reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding income taxes 
financial instruments 
we estimate fair values for each of our financial instruments  including derivative instruments 
most of these financial instruments are not publicly traded on an organized exchange 
in the absence of quoted market prices  we must develop an estimate of fair value using dealer quotes  present value cash flow models  option pricing models or other valuation methods  as appropriate 
the use of these fair value techniques involves significant judgments and assumptions  including estimates of future interest rate levels based on interest rate yield curves  credit spreads of the company and counterparties  volatility factors  and an estimation of the timing of future cash flows 
the use of different assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts recorded in the financial statements  which are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  hedge accounting requires that  at the beginning of each hedge period  we justify an expectation that the relationship between the changes in fair value of derivatives designated as hedges compared to changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged items will be highly effective 
this effectiveness assessment  which is performed at least quarterly  involves an estimation of changes in fair value resulting from 
table of contents changes in interest rates  as well as the probability of the occurrence of transactions for cash flow hedges 
the use of different assumptions and changing market conditions may impact the results of the effectiveness assessment and ultimately the timing of when changes in derivative fair values and the underlying hedged items are recorded in earnings 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of the effect of hypothetical changes to these assumptions 
public liability  property damage and other insurance liabilities 
insurance liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets include supplemental liability insurance  personal effects protection insurance  public liability  property damage and personal accident insurance claims for which we are self insured 
we estimate the required liability of such claims on an undiscounted basis utilizing an actuarial method that is based upon various assumptions which include  but are not limited to  our historical loss experience and projected loss development factors 
the required liability is also subject to adjustment in the future based upon changes in claims experience  including changes in the number of incidents and changes in the ultimate cost per incident

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and gasoline prices 
we manage our exposure to market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments  particularly swap contracts  futures and options contracts  to manage and reduce the interest rate risk related to our debt  foreign currency forwards to manage and reduce foreign currency exchange rate risk  and derivative commodity instruments to manage and reduce the risk of changing unleaded gasoline prices 
we are exclusively an end user of these instruments 
we do not engage in trading  market making or other speculative activities in the derivatives markets 
we manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk related to our use of derivatives through specific minimum credit standards  diversification of counterparties  and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk 
our counterparties are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience providing such derivative instruments 
our total market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors including the volatility present within the markets and the liquidity of the markets 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented 
these shock tests are constrained by several factors  including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single 
table of contents point in time and the inability to include the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
for additional information regarding our long term borrowings and financial instruments  see notes  and to our consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency risk management we have foreign currency rate exposure to exchange rate fluctuations worldwide and particularly with respect to the australian dollar  canadian dollar and the new zealand dollar 
we use foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency swaps to manage foreign exchange risk that arises from certain intercompany transactions and from non functional currency denominated assets and liabilities and earnings denominated in non us dollar currencies 
our foreign currency forward contracts are often not designated as hedges and therefore changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in earnings as they occur 
we anticipate that such foreign currency exchange rate risk will remain a market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we assess our market risk based on changes in foreign currency exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis measures the potential impact on earnings  cash flows and fair values based on a hypothetical appreciation or depreciation in the value of the underlying currencies being hedged  against the us dollar at december  with all other variables held constant  a hypothetical change increase or decrease in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material impact on our earnings at december  because unrealized gains or losses related to foreign currency forward and swap contracts are expected to be offset by corresponding gains or losses on the underlying exposures being hedged  when combined  these foreign currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk management our primary interest rate exposure at december  was interest rate fluctuations in the united states  specifically libor and commercial paper interest rates due to their impact on variable rate borrowings and other interest rate sensitive liabilities 
we use interest rate swaps and caps to manage our exposure to interest rate movements 
we anticipate that libor and commercial paper rates will remain a primary market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we assess our market risk based on changes in interest rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
based on our interest rate derivatives as of december   we estimate that a change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our earnings 
because gains or losses related to interest rate derivatives are expected to be offset by corresponding gains or losses on the underlying exposures being hedged  when combined  these interest rate contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
commodity risk management we have commodity price exposure related to fluctuations in the price of unleaded gasoline 
we anticipate that such commodity risk will remain a market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we determined that a hypothetical change in the price of unleaded gasoline  would not have a material impact on our earnings at december
