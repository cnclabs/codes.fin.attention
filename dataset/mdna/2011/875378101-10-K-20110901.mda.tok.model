item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this item should be read in the context of the information included elsewhere in this annual report including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in item of this annual report 
overview we are organized along product categories and have two reportable segments accessories  which includes belts and small leather goods  eyewear  neckwear  and sporting goods hunting accessories and gifts 
the overall retail environment and general economic conditions have shown signs of improvement during the past year and we have begun to see modest improvement in ordering levels from some of our customers  but many customers have continued to take a very conservative approach toward replenishing inventory in this environment 
as a result  we have made adjustments internally to respond to these conditions and we continue to work closely with our retail partners to develop products and programs to fit their needs and the current environment 
our operating results for fiscal were affected by lower net sales  higher freight costs and higher write offs associated with inventory expected to be returned by certain customers 
fiscal was also negatively impacted by charges recorded as a result of our june restructuring plan 
under this plan  we exited under performing  non core product categories that did not represent strategic components of our branded product portfolio  reduced salaried employee headcount and accelerated the recognition of future expenses under legacy infrastructure and contractual obligations 
as a result of this plan  we recorded a noncash inventory write off to accelerate liquidation of certain inventories associated with discontinued product categories million  one time termination benefits due to the reduction in salaried employee headcount  charges associated with the cessation of services performed under certain contractual obligations  and other costs 
for the year  we had a net loss of million  or per share 
in fiscal  we had a net income of million  or per share 
the following table presents sales and gross margin data for our business segments in thousands of dollars 
other financial information about our segments is incorporated herein by reference to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
net sales accessories gifts gross margin accessories gifts gross margin percent of sales accessories gifts total operating expenses accessories gifts the following presents selling  general and administrative expenses sg a  depreciation and amortization  and our interest expenses which are not directly allocated to one of our segments in thousands of dollars selling  general and administrative expenses unallocated restructuring charges acquisition related costs depreciation and amortization interest expense our sales are generally affected by changes in demand for our product categories volume as well as customer allowances and returns 
sales volume also can impact our gross margins in terms of product mix between mass merchant retailers  which typically sell product at lower price points than department stores  and specialty retailers 
the components of our cost of goods sold and sg a are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report and incorporated herein by reference 
we include the costs related to our distribution network in sg a while others may include all or a portion of such costs in their cost of goods sold 
consequently  our gross margins may not be comparable to others 
the following table presents net sales for each of our product categories in thousands of dollars belts gifts small leather goods other operationally  our most significant accomplishments in fiscal were increased belt market share in second half with our largest customer  organically grew our gifts product category  reduced sg a expenses as net sales declined from the prior year  executed restructuring plans that enhance our focus on our most profitable core product categories  simplify our stock keeping unit sku offerings and significantly reduce operating expenses associated with exiting non core product lines  and executed licensing agreements with national brands eddie bauer  haggar and wolverine 
entered into a new four year  million credit facility  which we believe will provide adequate liquidity for the foreseeable future compared to net sales and gross margins our fiscal net sales were million  which was million  or lower than the prior year 
fiscal gross margin of was down basis points from the prior year 
net sales for the accessories segment were million  which was million  or  lower than the prior year primarily due to reduced belt assortments and lower replenishment orders by our largest customer 
additional declines in net sales were driven by higher returns and sales concessions as we transitioned belt programs at certain customers and lower volume and higher sales concessions on certain small leather goods  offset partially by an increase in sales by our canadian subsidiary 
gifts segment net sales of million in fiscal were  or  greater than in the prior year primarily due to improved retail sell through rates and a decrease in holiday season returns 
accessories segment gross margins decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal primarily because of the million inventory write off associated with our discontinued product lines 
this negatively impacted the gross margin percentage by basis points 
the remaining decline was driven by lower sales of previously written down inventory  a higher mix of private label sales  higher freight costs and higher write offs associated with inventory returns from customers 
the gifts segment margin was basis points lower in fiscal compared to the prior year due to a higher percentage of sales of lower priced products  a higher mix of sales to close out customers  greater inventory write offs associated with slow moving inventory  and increased freight costs 
the higher freight costs in both segments were driven by decreased supply of shipping containers and increased air freight expenses resulting from supplier production delays during the first half of fiscal operating expenses total segment operating expenses in fiscal of million were million lower than the prior year million primarily due to decreases in compensation and facilities costs and lower royalties  offset partially by increases in customer chargebacks 
the increase in the gifts segment operating expenses for fiscal was due to higher royalties and higher customer chargebacks  which were both driven by higher net sales 
total sg a expenses of million for fiscal were million  or  lower than fiscal million 
the reductions were primarily due to decreases in compensation costs  facilities costs  advertising and professional services  offset partially by increases in bad debt provisions and customer chargebacks 
we incurred acquisition related costs of  during fiscal in connection with the chambers transaction  which we did not incur in fiscal depreciation and amortization for fiscal was  lower than in as a result of the cessation of depreciation on property and equipment located in yoakum  texas  which was no longer being used in operations and moved to held for sale during the current year 
interest and taxes interest expense for fiscal was  lower than that incurred in this decrease was primarily due to lower debt cost amortization under our credit facility and the chambers acquisition earn out liability discount accretion  which we did not incur in fiscal higher outstanding borrowings during the current year partially offset the decrease for fiscal the carryback of our fiscal net operating loss as the result of the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of  which became law in november  resulted in million of refundable income taxes paid for the fiscal period which was recognized and collected in fiscal as a result of incurring net losses during the past few years  we have a remaining federal income tax net loss carryover of million that will expire beginning in our effective income tax rates were and a negative in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in both years  the benefits of the federal statutory rate applied to our pretax losses were offset by deferred tax valuation allowances fiscal  fiscal 
the valuation allowances are recorded on our federal and state deferred tax assets because we have experienced cumulative operating losses over the past four years 
realization of the deferred tax assets and reversal of associated valuation allowances is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal net cash used by operating activities was million higher than in fiscal  primarily driven by the following a million tax refund in fiscal that did not occur in the current year  million higher fiscal funding of accounts payable and accrued expenses  million lower fiscal accounts receivable due to lower net sales  and million higher inventory purchases in fiscal investing activities for fiscal primarily consisted of a million inflow from the sale of our idle distribution center located in west bend  wisconsin  offset by purchases of additional racking and other various leasehold improvements for our distribution facilities and the completion of our acquisition of maquiladora chambers de mexico  sa de sa investing activities for the prior year related to the chambers transaction and consisted of the million estimated present value of an earn out agreement  a noncash financing activity  and million in cash from operating activities paid for the assets listed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report incorporated herein by reference 
purchases of property and equipment of million in fiscal were primarily related to the move of our corporate offices in december and the consolidation of our distribution facilities into our lower cost dallas  texas distribution facility 
property and equipment sale proceeds of  in fiscal were primarily from the sale of a warehouse in yoakum  texas which resulted in a  pretax gain included in other income 
in january  million of assets held in a trust for retired executive officers were liquidated and payment of the proceeds to the retirees reduced other current assets and accrued expenses 
financing activities included credit facility net borrowings of million in fiscal compared to net borrowings of million in fiscal net borrowings for fiscal were primarily used to fund our operating activities 
net borrowings for fiscal were primarily used for the chambers transaction and to fund our investing activities 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities and our credit facility 
effective august   we replaced our million credit facility with a million credit facility expiring in august we believe this new facility will provide us with sufficient availability to fund our operations in the foreseeable future and give us the additional flexibility to purchase inventory required to meet our organic growth expectations 
information about our credit facilities is incorporated herein by reference to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
at june   we had million borrowing availability and million in outstanding borrowings under our us facility and  borrowing availability and million in outstanding borrowings under our canadian facility 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies we use estimates throughout our consolidated financial statements 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made or changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
in addition there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates could have a material impact on our operations and financial position 
the accounting policies and estimates we consider most critical are presented below 
revenues and accounts receivable allowances sales are recognized when merchandise is shipped and title to the goods has passed to the customer 
we record allowances  including cash discounts  in store customer allowances  cooperative advertising allowances  and customer returns  as a reduction of sales based upon historical experience  current trends in the retail industry  and individual customer and product experience 
actual returns and allowances may differ from our estimates and differences would affect the operating results of subsequent periods 
sensitivity analysis the following table presents the estimated effect of the indicated increase decrease in our net sales  based on fiscal net sales of million  on our allowance for doubtful accounts and customer allowance dollars in thousands except per share amounts 
changes in general economic conditions  trends and developments within our industry  or situations unique to specific customers could result in significant fluctuations in the actual effects of these estimates 
sales allowances earnings change reserves expense per share change in customer allowances and returns change in allowance for doubtful accounts inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
cost includes the direct cost of purchased products and  for manufactured products  materials  direct and indirect labor  and factory overhead 
market  with respect to raw materials  is replacement cost and  with respect to work in process and finished goods  is net realizable value 
in our assessment of the value of inventory  we monitor retailer sell through rates  fashion trends  and the accumulation of excess inventory 
our assessment is both a quantitative measurement eg  the use of metrics such as the number of months supply on hand and qualitative measurement eg  the ability to utilize certain styles in current and future programs 
in general we have relationships with off price store customers that will purchase excess inventory at discounted prices and we have been able to realize values at or above the lower of cost or market values at which we carry our inventories 
if circumstances arise in which the market value of items in inventory declines below cost  an inventory markdown is estimated and charged to cost of sales in the period identified 
if we incorrectly anticipate these trends or if unexpected events occur  our results of operations could be materially affected 
sensitivity analysis the effect of a write down in the value of our inventory as of june  would be dollars in thousands except per share amounts percentage earnings of inventory inventory expense per share change in inventory write down uncertain tax positions tax liabilities  together with interest and applicable penalties  are recognized for the benefits of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements which more likely than not may not be realized 
we review the appropriateness of items of revenue or expense excluded or included in our tax returns and the requirements for filing returns with jurisdictions which may have laws requiring us to file tax returns 
failure to recognize a tax liability for the benefits of an uncertain tax position which ultimately is not realized could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 
share based compensation the fair values of restricted stock and performance unit grants payable in stock are estimated to be the market price of our common stock on the grant dates and  for performance units  reduced by the net present value of estimated future dividends 
the fair values of performance units measured in phantom stock units  which are payable in cash  are estimated to be the market price of our common stock as of each reporting date 
the assumptions we use to estimate the fair value of our stock options are based on historical information and current economic conditions 
estimated fair values increase if the expected dividend yield decreases and the other assumptions increase 
neither the grant date market values of our stock nor the resulting output of the black scholes option pricing model using our assumptions may be the value ultimately realized by our directors and employees or accurately measure the tax benefits we may realize
