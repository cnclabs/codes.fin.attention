part i item business 
we were incorporated under the laws of the state of florida on august  we are in the business of designing  developing and selling our proprietary radio frequency rf technologies and products for use in semiconductor circuits for wireless communication products 
our business is expected to include licensing of our intellectual property and the sale of integrated circuits based on our technology for incorporation into wireless devices designed by our customers 
our business may also include the joint development and marketing of wireless radio devices that incorporate our technologies 
in addition  from time to time  we provide engineering consulting and design services to our customers  for a negotiated fee  to assist them in developing prototypes and or products incorporating our technologies 
we are primarily focused on incorporating our technologies into mobile handsets  but our technologies are applicable to other wireless products that are related to networks serving mobile handsets such as data cards  femtocells  machine to machine mm and embedded applications 
our technology can also be applied to non cellular radio applications such as military radios 
our business operates under a single segment 
refer to our financial statements in item to this annual report for financial data including our net losses from operations and total assets 
recent developments on march   we completed the sale of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  at a price of per share and  units each consisting of one share of common stock and of a warrant to purchase common stock at a price of per unit  to a limited number of institutional and other investors under the september shelf 
the aggregate net proceeds from this offering were approximately million  after deduction of placement agent fees and other offering costs and will be used for general working capital purposes 
we also recently completed the testing process for our first rf product in collaboration with our baseband partner  via telecom  inc via 
this initial product is designed to interface directly with via s cdma baseband processors for use in g mobile applications 
one of via s handset customers is currently working with us for the design of this product into their mobile handsets and we anticipate receipt of the initial orders for this product in the near future 
general development of business our business has been primarily focused on the development and marketing of our rf technologies for mobile applications 
our technologies represent unique  proprietary methods for processing rf waveforms in wireless applications 
the technology applies to both transmit and receive functions of a radio transceiver 
the transmit portion of the technology is called directpower  or dp  and enables the transformation of a baseband data signal to an rf carrier waveform  at the desired power output level  in a single unified operation 
the receiver portion of the technology is called directdata  or dd  and enables the direct conversion of an rf carrier to a baseband data signal 
our development and marketing efforts since have been primarily focused on the transmit portion of our technologies  however  incorporation of the receiver technology in mobile applications is contemplated in our future product plans 
we completed the first dp integrated circuit ic which embodied many of the advancements of our technology in this enabled us to create partially integrated prototype radios for demonstration purposes 
since  we have continued to further advance our prototype ics and related demonstration platforms 
our prototypes support functionality that is multi band meaning multiple frequencies and multi mode meaning multiple cellular standards and corresponding modulation formats 
our ics support multiple bands of cellular and pcs personal communications service frequencies and support the current and emerging cellular standards including gsm edge  cdma  w cdma  and hsupa 
we are also able to demonstrate e wimax and lte standards with our current ics 
in concert with advancing our prototypes  we began cultivating potential customer relationships in the mobile handset industry 
we also explored potential relationships outside the mobile handset industry to the extent that the requirements of prospective customers were in concert with the needs of our primary target market 
we believe our direct customers will likely be the mobile handset manufacturers and their chipset suppliers in the mobile handset industry 
we also have and continue to cultivate relationships with the network providers who exert significant influence on the oems original equipment manufacturers in the mobile handset industry 
our lack of tenure in the mobile handset industry coupled with the unique nature of our technology resulted in lengthy and intense technology evaluation and due diligence efforts by potential customers 
furthermore  in order to utilize our technology in a mobile handset application  our rf chipsets must interface with the baseband processor that generates the data to be transmitted 
although our technology is capable of interfacing with any baseband processor  the development of the interface between the baseband processor and our chipset requires a cooperative effort with the baseband provider 
in december  we entered into a licensing and engineering services agreement with via who is a global supplier of cdma baseband processors that are used in a wide range of mobile devices 
via designs and supplies chipsets and related reference designs to handset oems and odms original design manufacturers for incorporation into mobile devices and their customer base includes at least three of the top five global handset manufacturers 
during and  our development efforts were focused on advancing our ics from prototype to production ready samples for via and other potential customers 
we also began development of various packaging designs and production test programs 
during  we worked with via to co develop a sample g mobile handset which verified our technology in a working implementation and tested our technology s performance 
the results of these efforts were utilized to market our product to via s customers 
during  we modified our circuit layout and packaging to meet the design requirements of one of via s customers  a rapidly growing handset oem 
the testing of our product in this design was completed in early and we are working closely with via and the handset customer towards the release of an order which we expect to occur in the near term 
although via has the right  under their licensing agreement with us  to manufacture devices based on our technology and pay us a per unit royalty for the license  the agreement also provides that we may manufacture and sell such devices ourselves to third parties 
we anticipate that our initial product revenues will be generated from chipset sales to via s customers rather than through the licensing arrangement 
we are highly dependent on our relationship with via  the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in  we entered into a licensing and engineering services agreement for our technology with itt corporation itt 
the itt relationship is a result of our marketing efforts outside of the mobile handset industry 
itt initially engaged us under the engineering services agreement to analyze and evaluate the architectural design alternatives for incorporation of our technology into rf circuits based on various product specifications 
in  we delivered a development demonstration platform to itt for their use in product development and demonstration to their customers 
itt marketed our technology  based on our commercial designs  to a number of their customers and in october  itt was awarded a government contract for the demonstration of our technology in a highly integrated transceiver application for military products 
itt in turn  engaged us as a subcontractor to incorporate our commercial ics into an existing highly integrated transceiver platform 
the services related to this product demonstration were completed in the first quarter of during  we assisted itt in seeking additional government funding projects for products incorporating our technologies  however  to date  we are not aware of any funds received by itt for this purpose 
we do not intend to initiate any new development efforts for itt related projects  unless those projects are funded by either itt or their customers 
in the event itt completes development of a product incorporating either our dp or dd technology  we will receive a per unit royalty from them for any such products sold under the terms of our agreement with them 
in december  we entered into a product and market development agreement with lg innotek co  ltd 
lgi  a division of the lg group 
the agreement provided for a cooperative working relationship between us and lgi for the development and marketing of rf modules that incorporated our technologies for use in mobile applications such as wireless handsets and data cards 
the agreement contemplated a supplier relationship between us and lgi whereby we would sell lgi tested  unpackaged integrated circuits for incorporation into modules designed for commercial hedge applications 
hedge is an acronym for applications that incorporate support for g  g and g waveform standards including gsm  edge  wcdma  and hspa 
during  we worked closely with lgi on both product development and joint marketing activities 
in early  we focused our limited development resources on g cdma based applications and  as a result  delayed the hedge specific development efforts with lgi 
to date  we have generated no royalty or product revenue from our dp technology 
our ability to generate revenues sufficient to offset costs is subject to our ability to successfully support our customers in completing their initial product designs and our ability to secure a reasonable market share through product offerings with our current customers and or the addition of new customers and or products 
we believe our technology has substantial advantages over competing technologies  especially in the third generation  or g  and fourth generation  g  mobile handset standards and applications 
we anticipate that the rate of adoption of our technologies will increase as shipments of devices incorporating our technology commence in future sales may be influenced by the terms negotiated with our current customers and our ability to expand internal resources to support multiple customers 
competitive position we operate in a highly competitive industry against companies with substantially greater financial  technical  and sales and marketing resources 
our technologies  which are currently being marketed in the mobile handset industry  face competition from incumbent providers of transceivers  such as broadcom  infineon  and qualcomm  as well as incumbent providers of power amplifiers  including companies such as anadigics  rf microdevices  and skyworks  among others 
each of our competitors  however  also has the potential of becoming a customer for our technologies 
to date  we are unaware of any competing or emerging rf technologies that provide all the simultaneous benefits that our technology enables 
our unique technologies process the rf waveform in a more optimal manner than traditional technologies  thereby allowing the creation of handsets that have extended battery life  more easily incorporate multiple air interface standards and frequencies in smaller form factors  and reduce manufacturing costs 
our technologies provide such attractive benefits  in part  because of their unique integrated circuit architecture which enables creation of highly accurate rf waveforms that use less power than traditional linear transmitter architectures and components thereby extending battery life  reducing heat and enabling certain packaging advantages 
hurdles to the adoption of our technologies include entrenchment of existing technologies  the disruptive nature of our technology  and our lack of tenure in the markets we are targeting 
we believe we can gain adoption  and therefore compete  based on the performance advantages enabled by our unique circuit architecture  as supported by a solid and defensible intellectual property ip portfolio 
our circuit architecture is capable of being compliant with all current mobile phone standards and can be configured to accept all standard baseband data inputs 
in addition  we believe that one or more of our technology s abilities to provide improved power efficiencies  highly accurate rf carrier waveforms  smaller form factors and better manufacturing yields  provides a solution to existing problems in applications for g standards and beyond that the mobile handset industry is seeking to solve 
production and supply the ics which incorporate our core rf technology are produced using a silicon germanium sige process through a fabrication relationship with ibm microelectronics ibm 
additional ics which contain the digital engine that controls our rf transmit ic and interfaces to the mobile phone baseband processor are produced through a third party fabrication relationship with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited tsmc using a cmos semiconductor process 
we believe ibm and tsmc have sufficient capacity to meet our foreseeable needs 
in addition  our ics can be produced using different materials and processes  if necessary  to satisfy capacity requirements and or customer preferences 
in instances where our customer licenses our ip  the production capacity risk shifts to that customer 
patents and trademarks we consider our ip  including patents  patent applications  trademarks  and trade secrets to be significant to our competitive positioning 
we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents  copyrights  and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products 
we currently have obtained us and foreign patents related to our rf technologies 
in addition  we have approximately us and foreign patent applications pending 
we estimate the economic lives of our patents to be fifteen to twenty years and our current portfolio of patents and patent applications has an estimated remaining life of approximately years 
from time to time  we obtain licenses from others for standard industry circuit designs that are integrated into our own ics as supporting components that are peripheral to our core technologies 
we believe there are multiple sources for these types of standard circuits and we estimate the economic lives of the licenses to be two to five years based on estimated technological obsolescence 
research and development for the years ended december    and we spent approximately million  million  and million  respectively  on company sponsored research and development activities 
our research and development efforts have been  and are expected to continue to be  devoted to the development and advancement of rf technologies  including the development of prototype ics for proof of concept purposes  the development of production ready silicon samples and reference designs for specific customer applications  and the creation of test programs for quality control testing of our ics in high volumes 
employees as of december   we had full time and two part time employees  of which are employed in engineering research and development  six in sales and marketing  and in executive management  finance and administration 
our employees are not represented by a labor union 
we consider our employee relations satisfactory

item a 
risk factors 
in addition to other risks and uncertainties described in this annual report  the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business because such factors may have a significant impact on our business  operating results  liquidity and financial condition 
as a result of the risk factors set forth below  actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements 
our financial condition raises substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
our independent registered certified public accounting firm has included in their audit opinion on our financial statements for the year ended december  a statement with respect to substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern 
our financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue to operate as a going concern  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
if we became unable to continue as a going concern  we may have to liquidate our assets and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
the substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern may adversely affect our ability to negotiate reasonable terms with our suppliers and may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital in the future 
we have had a history of losses which may ultimately compromise our ability to implement our business plan and continue in operation 
we have had losses in each year since our inception in  and continue to have an accumulated deficit which  at december   was approximately million 
the net loss for was approximately million 
to date  our technologies and products have not produced revenues sufficient to cover operating  research and development and overhead costs 
we also will continue to make expenditures on marketing  research and development  pursuit of patent protection for our intellectual property and operational costs for fulfillment of any contracts that we achieve for the sale of our products or technologies 
we expect that our revenues in will not bring the company to profitability and our current capital resources will not be sufficient to sustain our operations through if we are not able to generate sufficient revenues or we have insufficient capital resources  we will not be able to implement our business plan and investors will suffer a loss in their investment 
this may result in a change in our business strategies 
we expect to need additional capital in the future  which  if we are unable to raise will result in our not being able to implement our business plan as currently formulated 
because we have had net losses and  to date  have not generated positive cash flow from operations  we have funded our operating losses from the sale of equity securities from time to time 
we anticipate that our business plan will continue to require significant expenditures for research and development  patent protection  sales and marketing  and general operations 
furthermore  we expect that the implementation of significant cost reduction measures in order to reduce our cash needs would jeopardize our future growth plans 
our current capital resources include cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale securities of million at december  and million in estimated net proceeds from our march offering 
we believe our current capital resources will not be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for  and we will require additional capital to fund our operations 
financing  if any  may be in the form of loans or additional sales of equity securities 
a loan or the sale of preferred stock may result in the imposition of operational limitations and other covenants and payment obligations  any of which may be burdensome to us 
the sale of equity securities will result in dilution to the current shareholders ownership 
the long term continuation of our business plan is dependent upon the generation of sufficient revenues from the sale of our products  additional funding  reducing expenses or a combination of the foregoing 
the failure to generate sufficient revenues  raise capital or reduce expenses could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our long term business objectives 
our industry is subject to rapid technological changes which if we are unable to match or surpass  will result in a loss of competitive advantage and market opportunity 
because of the rapid technological development that regularly occurs in the microelectronics industry  we must continually devote substantial resources to developing and improving our technology and introducing new product offerings 
for example  in fiscal years and  we spent approximately million and million  respectively  on research and development  and we expect to continue to spend a significant amount in this area in the future 
these efforts and expenditures are necessary to establish and increase market share and  ultimately  to grow revenues 
if another company offers better products or our product development lags  a competitive position or market window opportunity may be lost  and therefore our revenues or revenue potential may be adversely affected 
if our products are not commercially accepted  our developmental investment will be lost and our ability to do business will be impaired 
there can be no assurance that our research and development will produce commercially viable technologies and products 
if existing or new technologies and products are not commercially accepted  the funds expended will not be recoverable  and our competitive and financial position will be adversely affected 
in addition  perception of our business prospects will be impaired with an adverse impact on our ability to do business and to attract capital and employees 
if our patents and intellectual property do not provide us with the anticipated market protections and competitive position  our business and prospects will be impaired 
we rely on our intellectual property  including patents and patent applications  to provide competitive advantage and protect us from theft of our intellectual property 
we believe that many of our patents are for entirely new technologies 
if the patents are not issued or issued patents are later shown not to be as broad as currently believed  or are otherwise challenged such that some or all of the protection is lost  we will suffer adverse effects from the loss of competitive advantage and our ability to offer unique products and technologies 
as a result  there would be an adverse impact on our financial condition and business prospects 
if we cannot demonstrate that our technologies and products can compete in the marketplace and are better than current competitive solutions  then we will not be able to generate the sales we need to continue our business and our prospects will be impaired 
we expect to face competition from chip suppliers such as anadigics  broadcom  infineon  qualcomm  rf microdevices  and skyworks  among others 
our technology may also face competition from other emerging approaches or new technological advances which are under development and have not yet emerged 
if our technologies and products are not established in the market place as improvements over current  traditional chip solutions in wireless communications  our business prospects and financial condition will be adversely affected 
our business is highly reliant on our business relationships with baseband suppliers for support of the interface of their product to our technology and the support of our sales and marketing efforts to their customers  the failure of which will have an adverse impact on our business 
the successful commercialization of our products will be impacted  in part  by factors outside of our control including the success and timing of product development and sales support activities of the suppliers of baseband processors with which our products interface 
delays in or failure of a baseband supplier s product development or sales support activities will hinder the commercialization of our products which will have an adverse impact on our ability to generate revenues and recover development expenses 
we rely  in large part  on key business and sales relationships for the successful commercialization of our products  which if not developed or maintained  will have an adverse impact on achieving market awareness and acceptance and will result in a loss of business opportunity 
to achieve a wide market awareness and acceptance of our products  as part of our business strategy  we will attempt to enter into a variety of business relationships with other companies which will incorporate our technologies into their products and or market products based on our technologies 
the successful commercialization of our products will depend in part on our ability to meet obligations under contracts with respect to the products and related development requirements 
the failure of these business relationships will limit the commercialization of our products which will have an adverse impact on our business development and our ability to generate revenues and recover development expenses 
we are highly dependent on mr 
jeffrey parker as our chief executive officer 
if his services were lost  it would have an adverse impact on our leadership and on how we are perceived within the industry and by investors 
because of mr 
parker s position in the company and the respect he has garnered in both the industry in which we operate and the investment community  the loss of his services might be seen as an impediment to the execution of our business plan 
if mr 
parker were no longer available to the company  investors might experience an adverse impact on their investment 
we currently have an employment agreement with mr 
parker and we maintain key employee life insurance for our benefit on mr 
parker 
if we are unable to attract or retain key executives and other highly skilled employees  we will not be able to execute our current business plans 
our business is very specialized  and therefore it is dependent on having skilled and specialized key executives and other employees to conduct our research  development and customer support activities 
the inability to obtain or retain these key executives and other specialized employees would have an adverse impact on the research  development and technical customer support activities that our products require 
these activities are instrumental to the successful execution of our business plan 
our outstanding options and warrants may affect the market price and liquidity of the common stock 
at december   we had  shares of common stock outstanding and had  options and warrants outstanding for the purchase of shares of common stock 
of these outstanding options and warrants   were exercisable as of december  all of the underlying common stock of these securities is registered for sale to the holder or for public resale by the holder 
the amount of common stock available for the sales may have an adverse impact on our ability to raise capital and may affect the price and liquidity of the common stock in the public market 
in addition  the issuance of these shares of common stock will have a dilutive effect on current shareholders ownership 
because the bid price of our common stock is below the minimum requirement for the nasdaq capital market  there can be no assurance that our common stock will continue to trade on that market or another national securities exchange 
on august   we received a notice from the nasdaq global market stating that  for the last consecutive business days  the closing bid price for our common stock had been below the minimum of per share required for continued inclusion on the exchange 
the notification letter stated that we would be afforded calendar days  or until february   to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement 
we were unable to regain compliance within that time frame 
as such  on february   we transferred the listing of our common stock from the nasdaq global market to the nasdaq capital market 
as a result of our transfer to the nasdaq capital market  we were granted an additional calendar days  or until august  to regain compliance 
in order to regain compliance with the nasdaq minimum bid price requirement  the bid price for shares of our common stock must close at per share or more for a minimum of ten consecutive trading days 
if we are unable to regain compliance by august   nasdaq will notify us of its determination to delist our common stock  which determination may be appealed to a nasdaq listing qualifications panel 
we intend to actively monitor the bid price for our common stock between now and august   and will consider all available options to regain compliance with the nasdaq minimum bid price requirement 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to regain compliance 
if we are unable to do so and our common stock is no longer listed on nasdaq or another national securities exchange  the liquidity and market price of our common stock may be adversely affected 
we may not be able to deliver shares of common stock upon exercise of our public warrants if such issuance has not been registered or qualified or deemed exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the warrant 
on march   november   and march   we sold warrants to the public in offerings registered under shelf registration statements 
the issuance of common stock upon exercise of these warrants must qualify for exemption from registration under the securities laws of the state of residence of the warrant holder 
the qualification for exemption from registration may differ in different states 
as a result  a warrant may be held by a holder in a state where an exemption is not available for such exercise and we may be precluded from issuing such shares 
if our common stock continues to be listed on the nasdaq capital market or another national securities exchange  an exemption from registration in every state for the issuance of common stock upon exercise of these warrants would be available 
however  we cannot assure you that our common stock will continue to be so listed 
as a result  these warrants may be deprived of any value  the market for these warrants may be limited and the holders of these warrants may not be able to obtain shares of common stock upon exercise of the warrants if the common stock issuable upon such exercise is not qualified or otherwise exempt from qualification in the jurisdictions in which the holders of the warrants reside 
provisions in the certificate of incorporation and by laws could have effects that conflict with the interest of shareholders 
some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us 
for example  the board of directors has the ability to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval  and there are pre notification provisions for director nominations and submissions of proposals from shareholders to a vote by all the shareholders under the by laws 
florida law also has anti takeover provisions in its corporate statute 
we have a shareholder protection rights plan that may delay or discourage someone from making an offer to purchase the company without prior consultation with the board of directors and management which may conflict with the interests of some of the shareholders 
on november   the board of directors adopted a shareholder protection rights plan which called for the issuance  on november   as a dividend  of rights to acquire fractional shares of preferred stock 
the rights are attached to the shares of common stock and transfer with them 
in the future the rights may become exchangeable for shares of preferred stock with various provisions that may discourage a takeover bid 
additionally  the rights have what are known as flip in and flip over provisions that could make any acquisition of the company more costly 
the principal objective of the plan is to cause someone interested in acquiring the company to negotiate with the board of directors rather than launch an unsolicited bid 
this plan may limit  prevent  or discourage a takeover offer that some shareholders may find more advantageous than a negotiated transaction 
a negotiated transaction may not be in the best interests of the shareholders

item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive overview we are in the business of designing  developing and selling our proprietary rf technologies and devices for use in semiconductor circuits for wireless communication products 
since  we have generated no product or royalty revenue from our wireless rf technologies 
we recently completed the testing  verification and acceptance process for our first rf product 
this initial product interfaces directly to via s cdma baseband processors for use in g mobile applications 
one of via s handset customers is currently working on a program with us for the design of this product into their handsets and we anticipate receipt of the initial orders for this product in the near future 
we believe our current capital resources  including the million in net proceeds from the march sale of our equity securities  will not be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for furthermore  we expect that the implementation of significant cost reduction measures in order to reduce our cash needs would jeopardize our future growth plans 
our independent registered certified public accounting firm has included in their audit report an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we believe the key factor to our future liquidity will be our ability to successfully use our expertise  our technology  and our current business relationships to generate sufficient revenues to offset our operating costs 
our ability to generate revenues sufficient to offset costs is subject to our ability to successfully support our customers in completing their initial product designs and our ability to secure a reasonable market share through product offerings with our current customers and or the addition of new customers and or products 
our business is highly reliant on relationships with baseband suppliers to support the interface of their product to our technology and to support the marketing and sales of our rf solutions  or reference designs that incorporate our rf solutions  to their customers 
we may be able to meet future liquidity needs through the issuance of equity securities under our outstanding shelf registration statements or through short or long term debt financing  although there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us 
we currently have no significant long term debt obligations 
we believe our technology has substantial advantages over competing technologies  especially in the third generation  or g  and fourth generation  g  mobile handset standards and applications 
we have made significant investments in developing our technologies and products  the returns on which are dependent upon the generation of future revenues for realization 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had working capital of approximately million  a decrease of approximately million from working capital of million at december  the decrease in working capital was a result of the use of approximately million in cash for operations  along with the investment of approximately million in patents and other long lived assets in this use of cash was offset by approximately million in proceeds from the sale of equity securities in at december   we were not subject to any significant commitments to make additional capital expenditures 
for the year ended december   we used cash of approximately million for operations and invested approximately million in patents  licenses and other long lived assets used in our operations 
this use of cash in was offset by million in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment and approximately million in proceeds from the sale of equity securities 
our use of cash for operations decreased approximately million from to this decrease was primarily the result of reductions in operating expenses  particularly outsourced engineering design services 
our future business plans call for continued investment in sales  marketing  customer support and product development for our technologies and products 
our ability to generate revenues sufficient to offset costs is subject to our ability to successfully support our customers in completing their initial product designs incorporating our technologies and our ability to secure a reasonable share of the market through additional product offerings with our current customers and or the addition of new customers 
we expect to begin generating revenue from the sale of our integrated circuits to via s customers in our product revenue for  however  will not be sufficient to cover our operational expenses for  and we expect that our continued losses and use of cash will be funded from available working capital 
in addition  we expect that available working capital will be used for initial production start up costs  including test programs and production tooling 
we believe our current capital resources  including the proceeds from our march sale of equity securities  will not be sufficient to support our liquidity requirements through furthermore  we believe significant cost reduction measures would jeopardize our future growth plans  including our ability to support initial production of our products 
we may be able to meet future liquidity needs through the issuance of additional equity securities under our outstanding shelf registration statements or through short or long term debt financing  although there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us 
we currently have no significant long term debt obligations 
the long term continuation of our business plan through and beyond is dependent upon the generation of sufficient revenues from our technologies and products to offset expenses 
in the event that we do not generate sufficient revenues  we will be required to obtain additional funding through public or private financing and or further reduce operating costs 
failure to generate sufficient revenues  raise additional capital through debt or equity financings  and or further reduce operating costs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our long term liquidity needs and achieve our intended long term business objectives 
results of operations for each of the years ended december    and revenues and gross margins we had no product or royalty revenues for the years ended december    or we recognized approximately  in service revenue in each of the years ended december  and under a fixed price service contract with itt 
the contract was for the purpose of incorporating our commercially developed dp integrated circuits into a highly integrated transceiver for demonstration of device performance to one of itt s military customers 
cost of sales for engineering services includes the direct labor costs  as well as overhead and other indirect costs including depreciation and allocated facilities costs 
indirect costs are allocated to cost of sales on a direct labor hour basis 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized gross margins on the itt service contract of  or  and  or  respectively 
we anticipate initial product revenue to commence in from sales of our rf integrated circuits to via s customers 
we anticipate the need for additional working capital in to support the production start up costs including test programs and production tooling 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of engineering and related management and support personnel costs  fees for outside engineering design services which we use from time to time to supplement our internal resources  amortization and depreciation expense related to our patents and other assets used in product development  prototype production and materials costs  which represent the fabrication and packaging costs for prototype integrated circuits  as well as the cost of supporting components for prototype board development  software licensing and support costs  which represent the annual licensing and support maintenance for engineering design and other software tools  and rent and other overhead costs for our engineering design facility 
personnel costs include share based compensation which represents the grant date fair value of equity based awards to our employees which is attributed to expense over the service period of the award 
research and development expenses decreased by approximately million  or  from to this decrease was primarily due to decreases in outside engineering design fees  prototype costs  software licensing and support costs  and share based compensation expense 
outside engineering design fees are generally project based and vary based on the magnitude and timing of those projects 
overall  these fees decreased from to by approximately  as a result of the completion of certain development programs late in and more limited design projects in prototype production and materials costs decreased from to by approximately  primarily as a result of the limited number of design projects in software licensing and support decreased approximately  from to as a result of changes in the software tools necessary to support our product designs 
share based compensation to executive and other research and development employees decreased by approximately  from to this decrease was primarily a result of equity awards granted in and that became fully vested in or early with limited new equity awards being granted during that same period 
research and development expenses decreased by approximately million  or  from to this decrease was primarily due to decreases in outside engineering design fees and software licensing and support costs 
our personnel costs  including wages  taxes  benefits  recruitment and travel costs  also decreased from to  however these decreases were offset by increases in share based compensation expense 
we also experienced an increase in amortization costs related to our patents and licenses 
outside engineering design services decreased from to by approximately  as a result of the completion of certain development programs late in  offset by new programs initiated in the second half of which were largely focused on the hedge development project 
software licensing and related support costs decreased by approximately  from to as a result of re negotiation of fees with various software providers as part of our cost reduction measures implemented in late as well as changes in the software tools necessary to support our product designs 
research and development personnel costs  excluding share based compensation  decreased approximately  from to this was primarily due to a decrease in cash incentive payments to employees  reduced travel expenses  and a reduction in recruiting costs 
this decrease was offset by an increase of  in our share based compensation expense for the same period 
the increase in share based compensation expense was a result of new equity awards to non executive employees to offset the impact of the reduced cash incentive programs  as well as the continued attribution of expense for engineering executive and other employee equity awards made in our patent and license amortization cost increased from to by approximately  due to continued additions to our patent portfolio and the purchase of licenses in and related to our product development activities 
the markets for our products and technologies are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
our ability to successfully develop and introduce  on a timely basis  new and enhanced products and technologies will be a significant factor in our ability to grow and remain competitive 
we are committed to continue investing in our technology and product development and therefore we anticipate that we will use a substantial portion of our working capital for research and development activities in marketing and selling expenses marketing and selling expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  including share based compensation and travel costs  and outside professional fees which consist of various consulting and legal fees related to sales and marketing activities 
marketing and selling expenses decreased by approximately million  or  from to this decrease was primarily due to reductions in personnel costs  including a decrease in share based compensation expense 
marketing and sales personnel and related costs  excluding share based compensation  decreased from to by approximately  primarily as result of the transfer of certain technical marketing employees to product development functions during and reductions in travel costs related to those employees 
the decrease in share based compensation expense of approximately  was primarily the result of a reduction in expense attributed to employee equity awards from through that became fully vested in and early with limited new equity awards being granted during that same period 
marketing and selling expenses decreased by approximately million  or  from to this decrease was primarily due to decreases in outside professional services and personnel and related expenses  partially offset by an increase in share based compensation 
outside professional fees decreased from to by approximately  as a result of a reduction in public relations and other technical marketing services rendered  coupled with a re negotiation of fees early in with certain sales consultants 
marketing and sales personnel costs  excluding share based compensation  decreased from to by approximately  primarily as a result of reduced employee head count  the elimination of cash incentive programs  and reduced travel expenses 
this was somewhat offset by an increase in share based compensation expense of approximately  for the same period as a result of new equity awards made to employees in to offset the impact of the elimination of the cash incentive program as well as the continued attribution of expense related to equity awards made in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive  director  finance and administrative personnel costs  including share based compensation  and costs incurred for insurance  shareholder relations and outside professional services 
our general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately million  or  from to this decrease was due primarily to decreases in share based compensation expense and outside professional fees 
share based compensation expense decreased approximately  from to this decrease was primarily the result of equity awards granted from through to executive and other employees that became fully vested in or early with limited new equity awards being granted during that same period 
in addition  our share based compensation expense included approximately  related to equity awards to our outside directors who waived all cash compensation for in  the cash portion of our directors compensation program resumed which resulted in increased directors cash fees of approximately  our outside professional fees decreased by approximately  due to a reduction in outside legal and accounting services incurred for the period 
our general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately million  or  from to this decrease was due primarily to decreases in cash fees to outside directors along with decreases in corporate travel costs  outside professional fees  and insurance costs 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in share based compensation expense 
our outside director cash compensation decreased approximately  from to as a result of non employee directors waiving their cash director fees in favor of equity compensation 
this decrease in directors cash fees was offset by an aggregate increase in share based compensation of approximately  from to the increase in share based compensation was a result of approximately  in share based compensation expense attributed to stock options issued to our non employee directors as payment for director and committee fees in and approximately  in share based compensation expense related to share options granted to outside consultants 
our outside professional fees decreased by approximately  from to due to a reduction in outside legal services incurred for the period 
in addition  the cost of our directors and officers liability insurance decreased by approximately  from to due to general market conditions 
our corporate travel costs decreased approximately  from to due to specific measures taken to reduce costs  including the sale of a fractional ownership in an aircraft in january interest and other income interest and other income consist of interest earned on our investments  net gains recognized on the sale of investments  and other miscellaneous income 
interest and other income increased approximately  from to as a result of changes in investment vehicles in interest and other income decreased approximately  from to as a result of declining interest rates due to market conditions and more conservative investments  as well as lower average cash balances during that period 
loss and loss per common share our net loss decreased approximately million  or per share  from to this decrease was primarily a result of a million  or  reduction in operating expenses and  with respect to the loss per share  a increase in weighted average shares outstanding for the period 
our net loss decreased approximately million  or per share  from to this decrease was primarily a result of a million  or  reduction in operating expenses and  with respect to the loss per share  a increase in weighted average shares outstanding for the period 
critical accounting policies we believe that the following are the critical accounting policies affecting the preparation of our financial statements intangible assets patents  copyrights and other intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated period of benefit 
we estimate the economic lives of our patents and copyrights to be fifteen to twenty years 
we estimate the economic lives of other intangible assets  including licenses  based on estimated technological obsolescence  to be two to five years  which is generally shorter than the contractual lives 
periodically  we evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets and take into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that may indicate impairment exists triggering event 
based on our cumulative net losses and negative cash flows from operations to date  we assess our working capital needs on an annual basis 
this annual assessment of our working capital is considered to be a triggering event for purposes of evaluating the recoverability of our intangible assets 
as a result of our evaluation at december   we determined that no impairment exists with regard to our intangible assets 
accounting for share based compensation we calculate the fair value of share based equity awards  including restricted stock  stock options and restricted stock units rsus  on the date of grant and recognize the calculated fair value  net of estimated forfeitures  as compensation expense over the requisite service periods of the related awards 
the fair value of share based awards is determined using various valuation models which require the use of highly subjective assumptions and estimates including i how long employees will retain their stock options before exercising them  ii the volatility of our common stock price over the expected life of the equity award  and iii the rate at which equity awards will ultimately be forfeited by the recipients 
changes in these subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of share based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized as expense in the statements of operations 
revenue recognition we account for service revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we use the percentage of completion method of accounting for cost reimbursement type contracts which specify a certain billable fee amount 
revenues are recognized as costs are incurred assuming that collection is reasonably assured 
our cost of sales includes the direct labor costs of personnel providing services under these contracts  as well as indirect costs such as depreciation and allocated facilities costs 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on loss before taxes as reported in the accompanying statements of operations 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when  based on available objective evidence  it is more likely than not that the benefit of such assets will not be realized 
our deferred tax assets exclude unrecognized tax benefits which do not meet a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
off balance sheet transactions  arrangements and other relationships as of december   we have outstanding warrants to purchase  shares of common stock that were issued in connection with the sale of equity securities in various private placement transactions in     and these warrants have exercise prices ranging from to per share with a weighted average exercise price of and a weighted average remaining contractual life of approximately years 
the estimated fair value of these warrants at their date of issuance of  is included in shareholders equity in our balance sheets 
refer to non plan options warrants in note to the financial statements included in item for information regarding the outstanding warrants
