the company finances its business through cash generated from operations  the proceeds from the notes offering and the million revolving line of credit 
the ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations is dependent on the continued demand for the company s products and services and its access to those products and services from suppliers 
the company s capital structure provides the financial resources to support the company s core business strategies of customer service and revenue growth 
the revolving line of credit  which is an asset based agreement  is collateralized by the company s accounts receivable and inventory 
the company s long term priorities for use of its capital are internal growth  acquisitions  and the repurchase of its common stock 
as the company s business grows  its cash and working capital requirements are expected to increase 
the company expects the overall growth in the business will be funded through a combination of cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under the revolving line of credit  capital markets  and or other financing arrangements 
the company has not provided for us income taxes on accumulated and undistributed earnings attributable to foreign operations as the company intends to permanently reinvest these undistributed earnings 
these earnings relate to ongoing operations and were  and  as of april  and april   respectively

based on prevailing market conditions  liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions  and other factors  the company may seek to retire a portion of its outstanding equity through cash purchases and or reduce its debt 
the company may also seek to issue additional equity or debt to meet its future liquidity requirements 
such transactions may occur in the open market  privately negotiated transactions  or otherwise 
the amounts involved could be material 
notes in august  the company issued million principal amount of senior convertible notes  which mature on august  interest on the notes is payable semiannually in arrears on february and august of each year 
the notes will be convertible into cash up to the principal amount of the notes and shares of the company s common stock for any conversion value in excess of the principal amount under the following circumstances i if the company has called the notes for redemption  ii in the event of a fundamental change  as defined in the indenture  such as a merger  acquisition  or liquidation  iii on or after may  and prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding august   iv prior to may   during the five consecutive business day period following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for a note for each day of that trading period is less than of the closing sale price of the company s common stock on such corresponding trading day multiplied by the applicable conversion rate  v prior to may   during any calendar quarter after september  in which the closing sale price of the company s common stock for at least of the consecutive trading days ending the day prior to such quarter is greater than of the applicable conversion price of per share contingent conversion trigger  or vi upon specified corporate events as discussed in the indenture governing the notes 
a note holder may not exercise his her conversion right with respect to all or any portion of a note  if such conversion would cause the note holder to become a beneficial owner of more than of the company s outstanding voting stock 
the initial conversion rate is shares of common stock per each in thousands principal amount of notes and is equivalent to an initial conversion price of per share 
the conversion rate is subject to adjustment if certain events occur  such as stock dividends or other distributions of cash  securities  indebtedness or assets  stock splits and combinations  issuances of rights or warrants  tender offers  or repurchases 
as of april   the fair value of the senior convertible notes was approximately million 
refer to footnote  debt  for a detailed discussion regarding the senior convertible notes 
the ability of note holders to convert is assessed on a quarterly basis and is dependent on the trading price of the company s stock during the last trading days of each quarter 
the contingent conversion trigger was not met during the three months ended april   therefore  the notes may not be converted during the company s first quarter of fiscal year the company used a portion of the net proceeds of the offering to repurchase approximately million of its common stock in privately negotiated transactions with institutional investors concurrently with this offering 
refer to footnote  equity  for additional information 
the company also used million of the net proceeds during fiscal year  when holders of the notes required the company to redeem million of the outstanding notes 
remaining proceeds have been used for general corporate purposes 
convertible note hedge transactions in connection with the offering of the notes  the company also entered into convertible note hedge transactions with respect to its common stock the purchased options with a major

part ii item financial institution  the counterparty 
the company paid an aggregate amount of million to the counterparty for the purchased options 
the purchased options cover  subject to anti dilution adjustments substantially identical to those in the notes  approximately million shares of common stock at a strike price that corresponds to the initial conversion price of the notes  also subject to adjustment  and are exercisable at each conversion date of the notes 
the purchased options will expire upon the earlier of i the last day the notes remain outstanding or ii the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the notes 
the purchased options are intended to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the notes in the event that the market value per share of the common stock  as measured under the notes  at the time of exercise is greater than the conversion price of the notes 
the purchased options are separate transactions  entered into by the company with the counterparty  and are not part of the terms of the notes 
holders of the notes will not have any rights with respect to the purchased options 
warrant transactions the company also entered into warrant transactions the warrants  whereby the company sold to the counterparty warrants in an aggregate amount of million to acquire  subject to anti dilution adjustments  up to million shares of common stock at a strike price of per share of common stock  also subject to adjustment 
the warrants will expire after the purchased options in approximately ratable portions on a series of expiration dates commencing on november  the warrants are separate transactions  entered into by the company with the counterparties  and are not part of the terms of the notes 
holders of the notes do not have any rights with respect to the warrants 
the purchased options will generally have the effect of increasing the conversion price of the notes to approximately per share  representing a premium based on the closing sale price of the company s common stock of per share on august  impact on diluted weighted average shares in accordance with asc  earnings per share  and the company s stated policy of settling the principal amount in cash  the company was required to include shares underlying the notes in its diluted weighted average shares outstanding since the average stock price per share for the period exceeded the conversion price for the senior convertible notes 
only the number of shares that would be issuable under the treasury stock method of accounting for share dilution was included  which was based upon the amount by which the average stock price exceeded the conversion price 
the company has experienced increases in the price of its common stock during fiscal year if the average stock price of the company s common stock exceeds per share  it will also include the effect of the additional potential shares that may be issued related to the warrants  which may negatively impact the company s diluted weighted average shares and diluted earnings per share 
the purchased options are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share prior to the conversion of the notes  as their effect is considered anti dilutive 
as of april   the purchased options were in the money and would have been convertible into approximately million shares of the company s common stock 
the exercise of the purchased options is restricted to each conversion date of the notes 
revolving line of credit the company had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit as of april  the credit agreement permits maximum borrowings of up to million  which may be increased to million 
after reducing availability for outstanding borrowings and letter of credit commitments  the company has sufficient assets based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory to borrow million excluding the additional increase of million under the revolving line of credit as of april  refer to footnote  debt  for a detailed discussion regarding the revolving line of credit 
the average daily interest rate  excluding debt issuance costs and unused line fees  for the fiscal years ended april   april   and march  was   and  respectively 
debt rating the company s debt is rated by a nationally recognized rating agency  standard and poor s ratings services s p 
companies that have assigned ratings at the top end of the range have  in the opinion of the rating agency  the strongest capacity for repayment of debt or payment of claims  while companies at the bottom end of the range have the weakest capability

the notes would be classified as a current liability during any such quarter 
the notes are discussed further in footnote  debt 
c amounts represent contractual obligations for operating leases of the company as of april  currently  it is management s intent to either renegotiate existing leases or execute new leases upon the expiration date of such agreements 
d if a supply agreement for select products between a vendor and the physician business or the elder care business were to be terminated  then the company may be required to purchase from the vendor all remaining finished and unfinished products and product materials held by the vendor 
as of april   the company had no material obligation to purchase remaining products or materials due to a termination of a supply agreement with a vendor who supplies select products to the company 
e amounts represent estimated additional consideration  including interest  to be paid to the sellers of previously acquired businesses  net of any amounts payable to the company for indemnity claims that arise under the purchase agreement 
f amounts represent the unused line fee on the revolving line of credit  which expires on september  g as of april   the company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of million 
this amount is excluded from the table above as the company cannot reasonably estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
critical accounting estimates in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  including the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the company periodically evaluates the accounting policies and estimates it uses to prepare its financial statements  which are then reviewed by the company s audit committee 
management s estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions considered reasonable with the relevant facts and circumstances 
based on the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ 
the critical accounting estimates are those estimates that require the company s management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and could have a material impact on the company s results due to changes in the estimates or the use of different estimates that could reasonably have been used 
additionally  the company includes those accounting estimates whose initial application had a material impact on the company s financial presentation  unless the application resulted solely from the issuance of new accounting literature 
the discussion below applies to each of the company s reportable segments physician business  elder care business  and corporate shared services  unless otherwise noted 

table of contents p 
part ii item allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses on trade receivables resulting from the inability to collect outstanding amounts due from its customers 
the allowances include estimates of specific amounts for those accounts that are likely to be uncollectible  such as bankruptcies  and general allowances for those accounts that management currently believes to be collectible but may later become uncollectible 
management believes the estimates used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts are critical accounting estimates because changes in credit worthiness and economic conditions  including bankruptcies  have had a material impact on operations in previous fiscal years and could have an impact on the company s results from operations in the near future 
the estimates used to determine the allowances for doubtful accounts are based on historical collection experience  current economic trends  credit worthiness of customers  and changes in customer payment terms 
the percentage of each aging category that is reserved is determined by analyzing historical write offs and current trends in the credit quality of the customer base 
adjustments to credit limits and allowances for bad debts are made based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate or improve  allowances may be adjusted  impacting general and administrative expenses and the accounts receivable balance 
physician business during fiscal years through  the physician business allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by customer deductions and write offs ranging from million to million and was increased by additional provisions ranging from million to million 
during fiscal year  the physician business allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by million for customer deductions and write offs and was increased by additional provisions of million  remaining relatively consistent with prior years 
during fiscal years through  the company s allowance for doubtful accounts has represented between and of the physician business trade receivable balance 
if management were to assume its reserve percentages as of april  were based on the fiscal year through historic ranges noted above  the allowance for doubtful accounts as of april  would range between million and million 
as of april  the allowance for doubtful accounts for this business segment was million 
elder care business during fiscal years through  the elder business allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by customer deductions and write offs ranging from million to million  and was increased by additional provisions ranging from million to million 
during fiscal year  the elder business allowance for doubtful accounts was reduced by million for customer deductions and write offs  while incurring a slight reduction in the provision 
during fiscal years through  the company s allowance for doubtful accounts represented between and of the elder care business trade receivable balance 
if management were to assume its reserve percentages as of april  were based on the fiscal year through historic ranges noted above  the allowance for doubtful accounts as of april  would range between million and million 
as of april   the allowance for doubtful accounts for this business segment was million 
although the company believes its judgments  estimates and or assumptions related to allowances for doubtful accounts are reasonable  making material changes to such judgments  estimates and or assumptions  and changes in customer s credit worthiness could materially affect the company s financial results 
inventories in order to state inventories medical products  medical equipment  and other related products at the lower of cost determined using the first in  first out fifo method or market net realizable value  the company maintains an allowance for excess or slow moving inventory based on the expectation that certain inventory will become obsolete  sold for less than cost  or become unsellable altogether 
the allowance is estimated based on factors such as historical trends  current market conditions  and management s assessment of when the inventory would likely be sold and the quantities and prices at which the inventory would likely be sold in the normal course of business 
changes in product specifications  customer product preferences  or the loss of a customer may result in an unanticipated impairment in net realizable value that may have a material impact on cost of goods sold  gross margin  and net income 
obsolete or damaged inventory is disposed of or written down to net realizable value on a quarterly basis 
additional adjustments  if necessary  are made based on management s specific review of inventory on hand 
management believes the estimates used in determining the allowance for excess and slow moving inventory are critical accounting estimates as changes in the estimates for both segments could have a material impact on net income and the estimates involve a high degree of judgment 
inventory allowances ranged from to of inventory for the physician business and to of inventory for the elder care business during fiscal years through if management were to assume inventory allowances were based on the fiscal years through historical ranges noted above  the allowance for excess and slow moving inventory as of april  would range from million to million for the physician business and million to million for the elder care 
table of contents p 
business  impacting the company s inventory balance and gross profit 
as of april   management estimated the required allowance for excess or slow moving inventory to be approximately million and million for the physician business and elder care business  respectively 
the increase in physician business inventory allowances above the expected range relates to additional reserves related to the fiscal year acquisitions of linear and dsi 
although the company believes its judgments  estimates and or assumptions related to inventory reserves are reasonable  making material changes to such judgments  estimates and or assumptions could materially affect the company s financial results 
vendor rebates the company receives transaction based rebates from third party suppliers 
such rebates are classified as a reduction to cost of goods sold in the accompanying statements of operations 
transaction based rebates are generally associated with a specific customer contract and are recognized as a reduction to cost of goods sold at the time the transaction occurs 
management establishes a reserve for uncollectible transaction based vendor rebates based on management s judgment after considering the status of current outstanding rebate claims  historical denial experience with suppliers  and any other pertinent available information 
management believes the estimates used in determining the reserve for uncollectible transaction based vendor rebates are critical accounting estimates because changes in the estimates could have a material impact on net income and the estimates involve a high degree of judgment 
reserves for transaction based rebates for the year ended april  and april  were million and million  respectively 
reserves ranged from to of rebates receivable during fiscal years through if management were to assume outstanding future rebate receivable write offs were based on the upper and lower end of the historical range  the transaction based rebate reserve as of april  would range from million to million  impacting the company s prepaid and other current assets balance and gross profit 
the fiscal year transaction based rebate reserve fell below the company s historical ranges 
during fiscal year  the company implemented a contracts and rebates administration system which provided enhanced visibility into various customer contract scenarios and reduced rebate denials during fiscal year although the company believes its judgments  estimates and or assumptions related to vendor rebates are reasonable  making material changes to such judgments  estimates and or assumptions could materially affect the company s financial results 
income taxes the company uses the asset and liability method for determining its provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities 
under this method  the amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in determining the need for valuation allowances  significant judgment and estimates are used as management considers short and long term forecasts of future taxable income as well as prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
these judgments and estimates include some degree of uncertainty and changes to these estimates could require management to adjust the valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
the company had gross deferred income tax assets of million and million as of april  and april   respectively 
there were no valuation allowances as of april  and april   as management believes it will fully utilize the company s deferred tax assets before their expiration 
the company s tax filings are periodically subject to review by the internal revenue service irs and other taxing authorities  which may result in assessments of additional tax 
resolution of these situations  either with the taxing authority or the courts  inevitably includes some degree of uncertainty  accordingly  the company provides taxes only for the amounts management believes will ultimately result from these proceedings 
management s experience has been that the estimates and assumptions used to provide for future tax assessments have proven to be appropriate 
however  past experience is only a guide  and the potential exists  however limited  that adjustments resulting from the resolution of current and potential future tax controversies may differ materially from the amount accrued 
current standards of accounting for uncertainty in income taxes provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes 
this standard requires management to make significant judgments while assessing the probability of possible outcomes of future tax examinations 
as of april  and april   the liability for uncertain tax positions was million and million  respectively 
management does not expect the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next twelve months 
if our estimates or judgments described above were to change  a hypothetical change in our effective tax rate would impact consolidated income from continuing operations by approximately million in fiscal year 
table of contents p 
part ii item valuation of intangible assets  other long lived assets  and goodwill acquisitions the company allocates the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
critical estimates in the valuation of acquired assets include  but are not limited to i expected future cash flows from existing customer contracts and relationships  ii assumptions relating to the impact of noncompete agreements on business operations  iii assumptions related to the impact on the timing of expected future cash flows  iv retention of customers and key business leaders  and v the risk inherent in investing in intangible assets 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates  or other actual results 
for these reasons  management believes the estimates used in determining the fair value of assets acquired through an acquisition are critical accounting estimates 
during fiscal years through  the company made acquisitions with initial purchase price totaling million 
during fiscal year  the company made acquisitions with initial purchase price totaling million 
adjustments to the valuation of acquired assets and liabilities subsequent to the date of purchase based on changes in management s original estimates were immaterial to the current and previous three fiscal years 
impairment under asc  intangibles goodwill and other asc  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may be impaired 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at each reporting unit annually on the last day of each fiscal year 
the impairment and disposal of long lived assets is accounted for in accordance with asc  property  plant  and equipment overall  asc 
asc requires that long lived assets  such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization  be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in the event that the carrying value of assets are determined to be unrecoverable  the company would estimate the fair value of the assets or reporting unit and record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 
in conducting the impairment analysis  the company determines the fair value of its reporting units using valuation techniques which may include discounted cash flow analyses requiring management to make certain assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  revenues  earnings  and other factors  including discount rates  to determine the fair value of these respective assets 
the application of different assumptions about such matters as estimated future cash flows or discount rates  or the testing for impairment at a different level of the organization or on a different organizational structure  may produce materially different results 
for these reasons  management believes the estimates used in evaluating the company s goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets  and long lived assets are critical accounting estimates 
based on management s review  goodwill  intangible assets  and other long lived assets were not impaired during fiscal years   and as of april  and april   the company s intangible asset  other long lived asset  and goodwill balances totaled million and million  respectively 
based on management s review  goodwill  intangible assets  and other long lived assets were not impaired during fiscal year and management does not believe there were any circumstances which indicated the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable in the future 
additionally  a hypothetical change in the discount rate utilized in the company s discounted cash flow analysis would not have indicated impairment for any of the company s reporting units 
long term incentive compensation equity incentive plans as of april   the company has outstanding grants of nonqualified stock options  time based restricted stock and performance based restricted stock outstanding 
estimates are required to determine the number of share based awards which will ultimately vest  and  in the case of performance based restricted stock  estimates of the company s future performance 
changes in the estimated forfeiture rates and changes in estimates regarding the company s performance can have material effects on share based compensation expense 
for this reason  management has determined that the estimates used to determine equity based compensation expense are critical accounting estimates 
when estimating forfeitures  the company considers termination behaviors as well as trends of actual equity based awards forfeited 
management re assesses the estimated forfeiture rate established upon grant periodically throughout the service period 
such estimates are revised if they differ materially from actual forfeitures 
as required  forfeiture estimates are adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures when an award vests 
actual forfeitures in future reporting periods could be materially higher or lower than management s current estimates  which could have a material impact on equity based compensation expense recognized in future years 

table of contents p 
when estimating the company s earnings per share goals for performance based restricted stock  the company reviews historical performance  internal plans and goals  economic conditions  and other performance metrics 
these future performance estimates are re assessed throughout the service period 
such estimates are revised  if necessary  if they differ materially from the original assessment and may have an impact on the vesting of an award 
if actual performance differs significantly from management s estimates  it could have a material impact on equity based compensation expense recognized in future years 
based on the financial results during fiscal year  management revised its assessment for probable achievement of performance conditions related to long term incentive compensation plans 
management reviewed the fiscal year results impacted by i the impact of revenue growth programs  ii the impact of implemented cost savings initiatives  iii the increase in sales of hn related products  and iv the gain on sale of shares in athena 
it was determined the cumulative impact of these events required the company to adjust its estimates and adjust the accruals to these plans based on those estimates 
the change in estimate for these awards resulted in an increase in stock based compensation expense of million during fiscal year  offset by a decrease in expense of million related to the departure of the company s former chairman and chief executive officer 
total stock based compensation expense during the fiscal years ended april   april   and march   was million  million  and million  respectively 
current forfeiture rates average per quarter  with actual rates ranging from 
to per quarter for fiscal years if management had used the low and high end of these actual ranges during fiscal year  equity based compensation expense  included in general and administrative expenses  would have been million and million  respectively 
holding forfeiture rates static  if management had estimated the company s future performance at the minimum and maximum earnings per share ranges  since inception of the awards  equity based compensation expense would have been million and million  respectively  during the fiscal year ended april  refer to footnote  incentive and stock based compensation  for additional information 
cash based incentive plans the company maintains cash based long term incentive plans  the shareholder value plans svp for certain employees 
the svp provides incentive to enhance shareholder value through the achievement of cumulative earnings per share goals 
estimates are required to determine the company s expected future performance and cumulative earnings per share at the end of the three year performance period 
changes in estimates regarding the company s performance can have a material effect on cash based incentive compensation expense 
for this reason  management has determined that the performance estimates used for long term cash based compensation expense are critical accounting estimates 
when estimating the company s earnings per share goals for the svp  the company reviews historical performance  internal plans and goals  economic conditions  and other performance metrics 
these future performance metrics are re assessed throughout the service period 
such estimates are revised  if necessary  if they differ materially from the original assessment 
if actual performance differs significantly from management s estimates  it could have a material impact on cash based compensation expense recognized in future years 
during fiscal year  the compensation committee approved the shareholder value plan svp 
the performance period under the svp was the three year period from march  to april  based upon current results and expected future results as discussed above  the company recognized an additional million in corporate compensation expense during fiscal year related to the svp related to a change in estimate 
there were no material changes in estimates during fiscal year the accrual  based on actual and expected future results  for the svp was million and million  located in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets  as of april  and april   respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements during fiscal year  the company adopted a new accounting standard that changes the consolidation model for vies 
variable interest entities are entities in which equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk to finance the entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support 
vies are consolidated by the primary beneficiary  defined as the party which i has the power to direct those activities that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and ii has an obligation to absorb an entity s losses or a right to receive benefits from an entity that could be potentially significant to the entity 
the standard requires ongoing reassessments to determine whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie 
the standard expands the disclosure requirements for enterprises with a variable interest in a vie 
see footnote  variable interest entity  for additional disclosures 
in october  financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standards update asu for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the update requires entities to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of the delivered goods and services based on a selling price hierarchy 
the 
table of contents p 
update eliminates the residual method of revenue allocation and requires revenues to be allocated using the relative selling price method 
the company will adopt this update prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year the company has evaluated this standard and determined it will not have a material effect on the company s statements of financial condition or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued an asu which amended accounting guidance for receivables to require further disaggregated disclosures that improve financial statement users understanding of i the nature of an entity s credit risk associated with its financing receivables and ii the entity s assessment of that risk in estimating its allowance for credit losses as well as changes in the allowance and the reasons for those changes 
the new and amended disclosures as of the end of a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after december  the company has adopted this standard with no material effect 
as of january  the portion of this update related to the disclosure of troubled debt restructurings had been deferred until fasb deliberations are complete 
in december  the fasb issued a new accounting standard that provided guidance on supplementary pro forma information for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  while not impacting the disclosure of pro forma information  the new standard changes the way such information is calculated 
specifically  consolidated revenue and earnings would be determined as if the business combination occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period 
this method is consistent with guidance set forth by the sec 
additionally  the standard required qualitative disclosures around the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to business combinations 
the company has elected to early adopt this standard 
see footnote  purchase businesses combinations  for further discussion 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
the company s objective in managing market risk exposures is to identify and limit the potential impact of changes in interest rates  commodity availability  and access of capital on earnings and cash flow 
the following assessment of the company s market risk does not include uncertainties that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable  such as political uncertainty  economic uncertainty  impact of future tax legislation  and credit risks 
interest rate risk 
the company s primary interest rate exposure relates to cash and cash equivalents and fixed and variable rate debt 
during fiscal year  the company s debt obligations consisted of i million senior convertible notes with a fixed rate of  and ii variable rate borrowings under the revolving line of credit  which bear interest at the bank s prime rate plus an applicable margin based on a fixed charge coverage ratio  or at libor plus an applicable margin based on a fixed charge coverage ratio 
fixed charge coverage is determined by the ratio of earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization to the sum of fixed charges  including but not limited to  interest expense  capital expenditures  payment of debt principal  and cash paid for taxes 
changes in interest rates affect interest payments under the company s variable rate revolving line of credit agreement 
the company periodically enters into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variable interest rate of its revolving line of credit 
during fiscal year  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of million swap 
under the terms of the swap  the company made payments based on the fixed rate and received interest payments based on month libor which effectively fixes the notional amount covered by the swap at a borrowing rate of plus a credit spread 
the changes in market value of these financial instruments are highly correlated with changes in market value of the hedged item both at inception and over the life of the agreement 
amounts received or paid under the interest rate swap agreement were recorded as reductions or additions to interest expense 
in accordance with hedge accounting  the company s interest rate swap agreement has been designated as a cash flow hedge with changes in fair value recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
as of march   the swap carried a notional principal amount of million and effectively fixed the interest rate on a portion of the revolving line of credit to  prior to applying the applicable margin discussed above 
the swap agreement expired on february  during the fiscal year ended march   the company recorded unrealized losses  net of tax  of approximately million  for the estimated fair value of the swap agreement in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
changes in interest rates also affect rates of return on the company s cash equivalents and short term investments  which generally consist of money market accounts 
during fiscal year  the company had average daily variable rate borrowings under its line of credit of million 
a hypothetical increase decrease in prevailing interest rates as of april   would result in a corresponding increase decrease in interest expense of less than million

the impact of the interest rate swap  a hypothetical increase decrease in prevailing interest rates as of april   would result in a corresponding increase decrease in interest expense of approximately million 
currency risk 
the company s currency rate exposures relate to products that are globally sourced from manufacturers in southeast asia 
currently  the company has negotiated settlement of payments to manufacturers in us dollars 
however  over time  local country currency fluctuations may increase or decrease the negotiated cost that the company must pay for these products 
in addition  the company may in future periods negotiate settlement of payments to manufacturers in the local currency of the country providing a product which would then subject the company to foreign currency risk 
commodity risk 
the company s primary commodity exposures relate to fluctuations in the price of gasoline and diesel fuel and the procurement of certain medical supplies in which the product cost is dependent upon the price of raw materials  which may fluctuate significantly 
the company s direct fuel exposure relates to fluctuations in fuel costs that affect the company leased delivery fleet or third party delivery charges 
significant increases in the cost of gasoline and diesel fuel have impacted  and may continue to impact  the company s gross margin  cost to deliver  and the operating costs of third party transportation providers 
some of these common carriers have passed these increases through to the company in the form of a fuel surcharge  which has had an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company implemented a fuel surcharge to its customers during fiscal year to pass on a portion of the increased cost of gasoline and diesel fuel  and adjusts the amount of surcharge based on market conditions 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to fully pass along further significant increases in fuel costs to its customers due to the competitive nature of the medical supply distribution industry
