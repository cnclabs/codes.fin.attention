and consolidated subsidiaries item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations of the company 
it is intended to be a discussion of certain key financial information regarding the company and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes to this report on form k 
overview we conduct operations as an insurance holding company emphasizing ordinary life insurance products in niche markets where we believe we can achieve competitive advantages 
as an insurance provider  we collect premiums on an ongoing basis to pay future benefits to our policy and contract holders 
our core operations include issuing whole life insurance  endowments  credit insurance  final expense  and limited liability property policies 
life insurance 
for over the past years  cica and its predecessors have accepted policy applications from foreign nationals for us dollar denominated ordinary whole life insurance and endowment policies 
we make our insurance products available using third party marketing organizations and independent marketing consultants 
through the domestic market of our life insurance segment  we provide ordinary whole life  credit life insurance  and final expense policies to middle income families and individuals in certain markets in the mid west and southern us the majority of our revenues are the result of acquisitions of domestic life insurance companies since home service insurance 
we provide final expense ordinary life insurance to middle and lower income individuals in louisiana  mississippi and arkansas 
our policies in this segment are sold and serviced through a home service marketing distribution system utilizing employee agents who work on a route system to collect premiums and service policyholders  and through networks of funeral homes who collect premiums and provide personal policyholder service 
the company derives its revenues principally from premiums earned for insurance coverages provided to insureds  net investment income  and net realized capital gains and losses 
profitability of our operations depends heavily upon the company s underwriting discipline  which seeks to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification  management of claims  use of reinsurance  the size of our in force block  actual mortality and morbidity experience  and our ability to manage our expense ratio  which we accomplish through economies of scale and management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses 
pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors  including the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes  proper evaluation of underwriting risks  the ability to project future losses based on historical loss experience adjusted for known trends  the company s response to competitors  and expectations about regulatory and legal developments and expense levels 
the company seeks to price our insurance policies such that insurance premiums and future net investment income earned on premiums received will cover underwriting expenses and the ultimate cost of paying claims reported on the policies and provide for a profit margin 
for many of our insurance products  the company is required to obtain approval for the premium rates from state insurance departments 
the profitability of fixed annuities  riders and other spread based product features depends largely on the company s ability to earn target spreads between earned investment rates on assets and interest credited to policyholders 
the investment return  or yield  on invested assets is an important element of the company s earnings since insurance products are priced with the assumption that premiums received can be invested for a period of time before benefits are paid 
the majority of the company s invested assets have been held in available for sale securities  including  among other asset classes  corporate bonds  municipal bonds  and government obligation bonds 

table of contents citizens  inc 
and consolidated subsidiaries the primary investment objective for the company is to maximize economic value  consistent with acceptable risk parameters  including the management of credit risk and interest rate sensitivity of invested assets  while generating sufficient after tax income to meet policyholder and corporate obligations 
the company maintains a conservative investment strategy that may vary based on a variety of factors including business needs  regulatory requirements and tax considerations 
marketplace conditions and trends described below are some of the significant trends affecting the life insurance industry and the possible effects they may have on our future operations 
as an increasing percentage of the world population reaches retirement age  we believe we will benefit from increased demand for living products rather than death products  as aging baby boomers will require cash accumulation to pay expenses to meet their lifetime needs 
our ordinary life products are designed to accumulate cash values to provide for living expenses in a policy owner s later years  while continuously providing a death benefit 
we believe there is a trend toward consolidation of domestic life insurance companies  due to significant losses incurred by the life insurance industry as a result of the credit crisis and recent economic pressures  as well as increasing costs of regulatory compliance for domestic life insurance companies 
we believe this trend should be a benefit to our acquisition strategy as more complementary acquisition candidates may become available for us to consider 
many of the events and trends affecting the life insurance industry have had an impact on the life reinsurance industry 
these events have led to a decline in the availability of reinsurance 
while we currently cede a limited amount of our primary insurance business to reinsurers  we may find it difficult to obtain reinsurance in the future  forcing us to seek reinsurers who are more expensive to us 
if we cannot obtain affordable reinsurance coverage  either our net exposures will increase or we will have to reduce our underwriting commitments 
while our management has more than years of experience in writing life insurance policies for foreign residents  changes related to foreign government laws and regulations and application of them  along with currency controls affecting our foreign resident insureds could adversely impact our revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
recent acquisitions in  the company acquired onlic  an arkansas domiciled life company 
this entity provided an arkansas field force of home service agents and funeral homes selling pre need and final expense policies and was merged into splic as of december   and is included in the home service segment 
in the first quarter of  the company completed its acquisition of integrity capital corporation icc 
icc is the parent of integrity capital insurance company icic  an indiana life insurance company that is included in the life insurance segment

and consolidated subsidiaries consolidated results of operations insurance revenues are primarily generated from premium revenues and investment income 
in addition  realized gains and losses on investment holdings can significantly impact revenues from year to year 
years ended december  in thousands revenues premiums life insurance accident and health insurance property insurance net investment income realized gains losses  net decrease increase in fair value of warrants other income total revenues exclude increase decrease in fair value of warrants total revenues excluding fair value adjustments of warrants outstanding premium income 
premium income derived from life  accident and health  and property insurance sales  increased during to million from million in the increase resulted primarily from renewal premiums  which totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
endowment sales represent a significant portion of new business sales internationally  as these products have gained in popularity over the past several years 
in addition  most of our life insurance policies contain a policy loan provision  which allows the policyholder to use cash value of a policy to pay premiums 
the policy loan asset balance increased year over year 
net investment income 
net investment income increased million with million in compared to million in  primarily reflecting higher average invested balances as a result of investment of new premium revenue  partially offset by lower interest rates 
net investment income performance is summarized as follows 
years ended december  in thousands  except for net investment income average invested assets  at amortized cost yield on average invested assets investment yields have declined over the past several years  as the company experienced significant calls by issuers of fixed maturity securities and those proceeds were reinvested into new securities yielding lower returns as the market rates declined 
in the current low yield environment  we anticipate investment income will decline despite the higher invested asset balances 

table of contents citizens  inc 
and consolidated subsidiaries we continue to invest in bonds of us government sponsored enterprises  such as federal national mortgage association fnma and federal home loan mortgage association fhlmc  due to our conservative investment strategy of investing in high quality issuers 
the company increased holdings in corporate and municipal bonds during the current year and over of total investment income in was attributable to the company holdings of fixed maturity securities 
policy loan income increased in the current year due to the growth in the asset balance  as policyholders utilized the policy loan feature to pay premiums and keep policies in force 
years ended december  in thousands gross investment income fixed maturity securities equity securities mortgage loans policy loans long term investments other total investment income less investment expenses net investment income income related to equity securities declined in the current year due to the fact the company disposed of a significant number of these securities during the year  resulting in lower investment income from dividends 
the majority of the disposed securities had been previously impaired 
other investment income for the year ended december  included a legal settlement of million in connection with a defaulted bond investment 
realized gains losses on investments

because the market value of our class a common stock decreased during and  we recognized a gain on the decrease in fair value of warrants of million and million  compared to a loss of million in the gains in and were directly related to the decrease in the price of our class a common stock 
the warrant liability is calculated using the black scholes option pricing model  which projects the future value of the warrants when they expire in july and current accounting standards require the change in the value of the warrant liability be recorded as a component of revenues 
when the liability increases we incur a loss  and when the liability decreases we recognize income 
the warrant liability is not anticipated to have an effect on the company s cash flows  as the company expects the warrants will either be exercised and converted into our class a common stock in july  or sooner  at the election of the warrant holders  or expire 
benefits and expenses are summarized as follows years ended december  in thousands benefits and expenses insurance benefits paid or provided claims and surrenders increase in future policy benefit reserves policyholders dividends total insurance benefits paid or provided commissions other underwriting  acquisition and insurance expense capitalization of deferred policy acquisition costs amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs amortization of cost of customer relationships acquired and other intangibles total benefits and expenses

total direct insurance inforce reported in was billion  and in was billion compared to billion in endowment benefits increased in each of the last three years 
we have a series of international policies that carry an immediate endowment benefit of an amount elected by the policy owner 
these benefits have been popular in the pacific rim and latin america  where the company has experienced increased interest in our guaranteed products in recent years 
like policy dividends  endowments are factored into the premium and  as such  the increase has no impact on profitability 
the company expects these benefits to continue to increase as this block of business increases 
property claims remained consistent in with the amount reported for in  hurricanes gustav and ike swept through louisiana resulting in an increase in property claims of  reserves 
the change in future policy benefit reserves has increased over the past several years

the company purchases exclusively investment grade securities  and the increase in the below investment grade category is due to municipals that were rated investment grade at december  and as of december  were no longer rated 
the company experienced a significant amount of maturities and call activity relative to the fixed income portfolio  with million reported in compared to million and million in and as interest rates declined over the past two years  issuers called those holdings and the company reinvested into lower yielding securities 
the gross investment yield on the fixed maturity securities portfolio dropped approximately basis points from compared to we expect lower yields on our investment portfolio due to the current low interest rate environment 
valuation of investments in fixed maturity and equity securities we evaluate the carrying value of our fixed maturity and equity securities at least quarterly 
the company monitors all debt and equity securities on an on going basis relative to changes in credit ratings  market prices  earnings trends and financial performance  in addition to specific region or industry reviews 
the assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on a case by case evaluation of underlying reasons for the decline in fair value 
the company determines other than temporary impairment by reviewing all relevant evidence related to the specific security issuer as well as the company s intent to sell the security  or if it is more likely than not that the company would be required to sell a security before recovery of its amortized cost 
when an other than temporary impairment has occurred  the amount of the other than temporary impairment recognized in earnings depends on whether the company intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
if the company intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  an other than temporary impairment is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment s cost and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
if the company does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that the company is required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  the other than temporary impairment will be separated into the following a the amount representing the credit loss  and b the amount related to all other factors 
the amount of the total other than temporary impairment related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings 
the amount of the total other than temporary impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes 
the previous amortized cost basis less the other than temporary impairment recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment 
the new amortized cost is not adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value

splic has significant investments in corporate and municipal bonds 
an additional impairment of  was recorded in to write a security down to zero carrying value 
in  the company impaired three bonds for million and a number of common stocks totaling million 
these impairments resulted from declines due to credit quality of the issuers and have been reflected as a realized loss in the accompanying income statement 
the company impaired two bonds totaling million during  because the company did not expect these securities to recover in value 
the company recorded other than temporary impairment charges on its mutual fund equity securities in in the amount of million because the company did not expect these securities to recover in value in the near term 
based upon our emphasis on investing in fixed maturity securities primarily composed of obligations of us government sponsored corporations and our analysis of whether declines in fair value below cost are temporary or other than temporary  management believes that our investments in fixed maturity investments at december  were not impaired  and no additional other than temporary losses need to be recorded 
gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities available for sale amounted to million as of december  and million as of december  this increase was primarily due to a lower interest rate environment  which put downward pricing pressure on the fair values of our us government  municipal and agency bonds 
there were no gross unrealized losses on equity securities as of december  in and  the company sold equity mutual fund holdings from the life and home service segments and recorded realized gains of million and million due to market recovery since impairment at december  information on unrealized gains and losses by category is set forth in our consolidated financial statements  note investments  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
reinsurance as is customary among insurance companies  our insurance company subsidiaries reinsure with other companies portions of the life insurance risks they underwrite 
a primary purpose of reinsurance agreements is to enable an insurance company to reduce the amount of risk on any particular life and  by reinsuring the amount exceeding the maximum amount the insurance company is willing to retain  to insure individuals in amounts larger than it could without such agreements 
even though a portion of the risk may be reinsured  our insurance company subsidiaries remain liable to perform all the obligations imposed by the policies issued by them and could be liable if their reinsurers were unable to meet their obligations under the reinsurance agreements 
we believe we have established appropriate reinsurance coverage based upon our net retained insured liabilities compared to our surplus 
the effect of reinsurance on premiums is as follows years ended december  in thousands direct premiums reinsurance assumed reinsurance ceded net premiums our insurance subsidiaries monitor the solvency of their reinsurers in seeking to minimize the risk of loss in the event of default by a reinsurer 
the primary reinsurers of our insurance subsidiaries are large  well capitalized entities

spfic elected to increase the amount of first and second event catastrophe reinsurance in to million per event from million and raise its retention level to  per event from  after the negative effects from hurricane katrina in thus  the first  of incurred claims and any claims in excess of million were splic s responsibility 
the same reinsurance levels were in place for through the reinsurance premium for first event catastrophe reinsurance was   and  in  and  respectively 
in  spfic also paid reinsurance premiums in the amount of  for second and third event coverage due to hurricanes gustav and ike in liquidity and capital resources liquidity refers to a company s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the needs of its operations 
liquidity is managed on insurance operations to ensure stable and reliable sources of cash flows to meet obligations and is provided by a variety of sources 
our liquidity requirements are met primarily by funds provided from operations 
premium deposits and revenues  investment income and investment maturities are the primary sources of funds  while investment purchases  policy benefits  and operating expenses are the primary uses of funds 
we historically have not had to liquidate investments to provide cash flow  but in spfic needed to sell  of bonds because of liquidity needs as a result of hurricanes gustav and ike 
there were no such liquidity issues in or our investments consist primarily of marketable debt securities that could be readily converted to cash for liquidity needs 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a table disclosing our contractual obligations 
a primary liquidity concern is the risk of an extraordinary level of early policyholder withdrawals 
we include provisions within our insurance policies  such as surrender charges  that help limit and discourage early withdrawals 
since these contractual withdrawals  as well as the level of surrenders experienced  have been largely consistent with our assumptions in asset liability management  our associated cash outflows have  historically  not had an adverse impact on our overall liquidity 
individual life insurance policies are less susceptible to withdrawal than annuity reserves and deposit liabilities because policyholders may incur surrender charges and undergo a new underwriting process in order to obtain a new insurance policy 
cash flow projections and cash flow tests under various market interest rate scenarios are also performed annually to assist in evaluating liquidity needs and adequacy 
we currently anticipate that available liquidity sources and future cash flows will be adequate to meet our needs for funds 
cash flows from our insurance operations historically have been sufficient to meet current needs 
cash flows from operating activities were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have traditionally also had significant cash flows from both scheduled and unscheduled investment security maturities  redemptions  and prepayments  which totaled million  million and million in  and these cash flows  for the most part  are reinvested in fixed income securities 
net cash outflows from investment activity totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the outflows from investing activities for the year ended december   primarily related to the investment of excess cash and cash equivalents generated from operations during the company s cash flows from financing activities were million in  million in and million in in  the company received million from capital contributions relating to our series a preferred stock 
stockholders equity at december  was million compared to million at december  the increase was largely due to income earned during the period offset by a decrease in net unrealized gains on securities available for sale 
investments increased to million at december  from million at december   resulting in an increase  mainly due to the increase in fixed income holdings in the company s portfolio 
the asset increased primarily from new and renewal premium income 
fixed maturities are categorized as fixed maturities available for sale  which are carried in our consolidated financial statements at fair value and held to maturity  which are carried at amortized cost 
fixed maturities available for sale were of investments at december   and fixed maturities held to maturity were of investments at december  policy loans comprised of invested assets at december  compared to at december  these loans  which are secured by the underlying policy values  have yields ranging from to and maturities that are related to the maturity or termination of the applicable policies 
management believes we maintain adequate liquidity despite the uncertain maturities of these loans

and consolidated subsidiaries our cash balances at our primary depositories were significantly in excess of federal deposit insurance corporation coverage at december  and december  management monitors the solvency of all financial institutions in which we have funds to minimize the exposure for loss 
management does not believe we are at significant risk for such a loss 
the naic has established minimum capital requirements in the form of risk based capital rbc 
risk based capital factors the type of business written by an insurance company  the quality of its assets  and various other aspects of an insurance company s business to develop a minimum level of capital called authorized control level risk based capital and compares this level to an adjusted statutory capital that includes capital and surplus as reported under statutory accounting principles  plus certain investment reserves 
should the ratio of adjusted statutory capital to control level risk based capital fall below  a series of actions by the affected company would begin 
at december   all of our insurance subsidiaries were above the required minimum levels 
two of our subsidiaries fell below the minimum rbc threshold at december  a capital contribution of million was made to spfic during the first quarter of an additional million capital contribution was made to spfic in the third quarter of a capital contribution of million was also made to ozark national life insurance company onlic during the first quarter of due to its rbc ratio falling below at december  the decline in spfic s capital balance mainly resulted from hurricane losses in and an increase in operating expenses 
the reduction in onlic s capital balance resulted from declines in asset values of preferred and common stock holdings 
these capital contributions increased the rbc ratios and rbc action plans were submitted to the relevant insurance departments 
the capital balance of onlic was determined to be at the company action level at march  due to continued declines relative to its investment holdings 
the capital contributions made in increased the ratios as anticipated in action plans submitted to the appropriate state insurance departments 
the company received approval from the respective state insurance departments to merge onlic into splic as of october  the capital contributions did not impact the overall consolidated financial position or results of operations of the company 
all insurance subsidiaries were above the rbc minimums at december  due to a decline in statutory surplus  cnlic no longer met minimum capital and surplus requirements as of june  in two states it is licensed in  florida  deficient by approximately million  and mississippi  deficient by approximately million

we do not utilize special purpose entities as investment vehicles  nor are there any such entities in which we have an investment that engages in speculative activities of any nature  and we do not use such investments to hedge our investment positions 
parent company liquidity and capital resources we are a holding company and have had minimal operations of our own 
our assets primarily consist of the capital stock of our subsidiaries 
accordingly  our cash flows depend upon the availability of statutorily permissible payments  primarily payments under management agreements from our two primary life insurance subsidiaries  cica and splic 
the ability to make payments is limited by applicable laws and regulations of colorado  cica s state of domicile  and louisiana  splic s state of domicile  which subject insurance operations to significant regulatory restrictions 
these laws and regulations require  among other things  that these insurance subsidiaries maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends these subsidiaries can pay to the holding company 
we historically have not relied upon dividends from subsidiaries for our cash flow needs and we do not intend to do so in the future

critical accounting estimates our critical accounting policies are as follows policy liabilities future policy benefit reserves have been computed by the net level premium method with assumptions as to investment yields  dividends on participating business  mortality and withdrawals based upon our experience 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of policy liabilities and the increase in future policy benefit reserves 
management s judgments and estimates for future policy benefit reserves provide for possible unfavorable deviation 
we continue to use the original assumptions including a provision for the risk of adverse deviation in subsequent periods to determine the changes in the liability for future policy benefits the lock in concept unless a premium deficiency exists 
management monitors these assumptions and has determined that a premium deficiency did not exist as of december  management believes that our policy liabilities and increase in future policy benefit reserves as of the years ended december   and are based upon assumptions  including a provision for the risk of adverse deviation  that do not warrant revision 
the relative stability of these assumptions and management s analysis is discussed below 
deferred policy acquisition costs acquisition costs  consisting of commissions and policy issuance  underwriting and agency expenses that relate to and vary with the production of new business  are deferred 
these deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized primarily over the estimated premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the ratio of the annual premium recognized to the total premium revenue anticipated  using the same assumptions as were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits 
we utilize the factor method to determine the amount of costs to be capitalized and the ending asset balance 
the factor method is based on the ratio of premium revenue recognized for the policies in force at the end of each reporting period compared to the premium revenue recognized for policies in force at the beginning of the reporting period 
the factor method ensures that policies that lapsed or surrendered during the reporting period are no longer included in the deferred policy acquisition costs calculation 
the factor method limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value  provided actual experience is comparable to that contemplated in the factors 
inherent in the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs are certain management judgments about what acquisition costs are deferred  the ending asset balance and the annual amortization 
approximately of our capitalized deferred acquisition costs are attributed to first year excess commissions 
the remaining are attributed to costs that vary with and are directly related to the acquisition of new insurance business 
those costs generally include costs related to the production  underwriting and issuance of new business 
a recoverability test that considers  among other things  actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually 
these annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium gross premium less benefit and expense portion of premium for the next years 
the available premium per policy and the deferred policy acquisition costs per policy are then calculated 
the deferred policy acquisition costs are then evaluated over two methods utilizing reasonable assumptions and two other methods using pessimistic assumptions 
the two methods using reasonable assumptions illustrate an early deferred policy acquisition recoverability period 
the two methods utilizing pessimistic assumptions still support early recoverability of our aggregate deferred policy acquisition costs 
management believes that our deferred policy acquisition costs and related amortization for the years ended december   and limits the amount of deferred costs to its estimated realizable value 
this belief is based upon the analysis performed on capitalized expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance business  utilization of the factor method and annual recoverability testing

and consolidated subsidiaries cost of customer relationships acquired cost of customer relationships acquired ccra is established when we purchase a block of insurance 
ccra is amortized primarily over the emerging profit of the related policies using the same assumptions as were used in computing liabilities for future policy benefits 
we utilize various methods to determine the amount of the ending asset balance  including a static model and a dynamic model 
inherent in the amortization of ccra are certain management judgments about the ending asset balance and the annual amortization 
the assumptions used are based upon interest  mortality and lapses at the time of purchase 
a recoverability test that considers  among other things  actual experience and projected future experience is performed at least annually 
these annual recoverability tests initially calculate the available premium gross premium less benefit and expense portion of premium for the next thirty years 
the ccra is then evaluated utilizing reasonable assumptions 
management believes that our ccra and related amortization is recoverable for the years ended december   and this belief is based upon the analysis performed on estimated future results of the block and our annual recoverability testing 
goodwill current accounting guidance requires that goodwill balances be review for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that a triggering event has occurred 
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment on one level below an operating segment 
most of the company s reporting units  for which goodwill has been allocated  are equivalent to the company s operating segment  as there is no discrete financial information available for the separate components of the segment or all of the components of the segment have similar economic characteristics 
the goodwill impairment test follows a two step process as defined under current accounting guidance 
in the first step  the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment 
in the second step  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
management s determination of the fair value of each reporting unit incorporates multiple inputs including discounted cash flow calculations  peer company price to earnings multiples  the level of the company s class a common stock price and assumptions that market participants would make in valuing the reporting unit 
other assumptions can include levels of economic capital  future business growth  and earnings projections 
valuation of investments in fixed maturity and equity securities the evaluation of securities for impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process  which is subject to risks and uncertainties and is intended to determine whether declines in the fair value of investments should be recognized in current period earnings 
the risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions  the issuer s financial condition or future prospects  the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery period 
based upon current accounting guidance  investment securities must be classified as held to maturity  available for sale or trading 
management determines the appropriate classification at the time of purchase 
the classification of securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities 
fixed maturity securities are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and the company has the ability to hold the securities to maturity 
securities not classified as held to maturity are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value  with the unrealized holding gains and losses  net of tax  reported in other comprehensive income and do not affect earnings until realized

and consolidated subsidiaries the company evaluates all securities on a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic conditions warrant additional evaluations  for determining if an otti exists pursuant to the accounting guidelines 
in evaluating the possible impairment of securities  consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial conditions and near term prospects of the issuer  and the ability and intent of the company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
in analyzing an issuer s financial condition  the company may consider whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies  by government sponsored agencies  or whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred  and reviews of the issuer s financial condition 
if management determines that an investment experienced an otti  management must then determine the amount of otti to be recognized in earnings 
if management does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the company will not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period loss  the otti will be separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors 
the amount of otti related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized in earnings 
the amount of otti related to other factors will be recognized in other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes 
the previous amortized cost basis less the otti recognized in earnings will become the new amortized cost basis of the investment 
if management intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss  the otti will be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
any recoveries related to the value of these securities are recorded as an unrealized gain as other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity and not recognized in income until the security is ultimately sold 
the company from time to time may dispose of an impaired security in response to asset liability management decisions  future market movements  business plan changes  or if the net proceeds can be reinvested at a rate of return that is expected to recover the loss within a reasonable period of time 
premium revenue and related expenses premiums on life and accident and health policies are reported as earned when due or  for short duration contracts  over the contract period on a pro rata basis 
benefits and expenses are associated with earned premiums so as to result in recognition of profits over the estimated life of the contracts 
this matching is accomplished by means of provisions for future benefits and the capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
annuities are accounted for in a manner consistent with accounting for interest bearing financial instruments 
our primary annuity products do not include fees or other such charges 
tax accounting a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability is recorded only if a determination is made that is more likely than not that the tax treatment on which the deferred tax item depends will be sustained in the event of an audit 
these determinations inherently involve management s judgment 
in addition  the company must record a tax valuation allowance with respect to deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will not be realized 
this valuation allowance is in essence a contra account to the deferred tax asset 
management must determine the portion of the deferred tax asset and resulting tax benefit that may not be realized based upon judgment of expected outcomes 
due to significant estimates utilized in establishing the valuation allowance and the potential for changes in facts and circumstances  it is reasonably possible that we will be required to record a valuation allowance in future reporting periods 
such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and capital position
