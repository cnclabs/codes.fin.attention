item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reserve for losses and loss expenses and note reserve for losses and loss expenses in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
enterprise risk management we have developed a strong risk management culture within the company through the establishment of various processes and controls focused on the company s risk exposures 
our enterprise risk management erm activities are critical to the organization s senior management  business units and board of directors 
the goals of our erm framework that drive our corporate strategy are as follows identify and manage the risks that threaten the company and its solvency  optimize the company s risk based capital position  maximize the company s risk adjusted returns on capital  manage underwriting  investment and operational volatility  and clearly communicate our approach to our employees and external constituencies 
in order to meet our erm goals  the company has established risk tolerances applicable to all areas of our business 
it is our corporate objective to limit the risk of a significant loss on an economic basis from a one in one hundred year series of catastrophic events to no more than of our shareholders equity 
we define economic basis as premiums plus net investment income less incurred losses and loss expenses  acquisition expenses and general and administrative expenses 
on a group basis  we monitor our capital position relative to our internal requirements and the requirements of our regulators and rating agencies  and liquidity by stressing cash outflow scenarios relative to available cash and cash equivalents and other forms of liquidity 
in addition  we have developed processes  models and a detailed internal control structure to specifically address our risk exposures 
the company s primary risk exposure areas are as follows underwriting risk  including certain key underwriting risks associated with the pricing and exposure evaluation process  catastrophe correlation aggregation risk  the risk embedded in the loss reserve estimation process  investment risk  and operational risk 
the following sections more specifically address our method and procedures for addressing and managing our underwriting  catastrophe  loss reserving  investment and operational risks 
underwriting risk management internal underwriting controls are established by our chief executive officer  president and chief underwriting officer 
underwriting authority is delegated to the managers of our lines of business in each business segment and to underwriters in accordance with prudent practice and an understanding of each underwriter s capabilities 
detailed letters of underwriting authority are issued to each of our underwriters 
these letters contain our operating guidelines  a description of the analytic process to be followed  referral requirements broken down by sources of business  terms and conditions  situations  limits capacity and annual premium for any one contract 
our return on capital guidelines are attached to each letter as an exhibit and are stated in terms of maximum combined ratio targets  excluding our general and administrative expenses  and minimum return on risk based capital by line of business 
our return on capital guidelines are regularly reviewed by our president  chief underwriting officer and our chief risk officer to reflect changes in market conditions  interest rates  capital requirements and market expected returns 
in addition  oversight of underwriting and risk management is provided by our board of directors and its underwriting and risk committees 
for a further discussion on the role of our board of directors in the company s risk management  see the role of the board of directors in risk management below 

table of contents we have a disciplined approach to underwriting and risk management that relies heavily upon the collective underwriting expertise of our management and staff 
this expertise is in turn guided by the following underwriting principles we will underwrite and accept only those risks we know and understand  we will perform our own independent pricing or risk review on all risks we accept  and we will accept only those risks that are expected to earn a return on capital commensurate with the risk they present 
before we review any natural catastrophe exposed insurance or reinsurance proposal  we consider the appropriateness of the client  including the quality of its management and its risk management strategy 
in addition  we require each proposal to include significant information on the nature of the perils to be included and detailed aggregate information as to the location or locations of the risks covered 
we further request information on the client s loss history for the perils being insured or reinsured  together with relevant underwriting considerations 
if a proposal meets the preceding underwriting criteria  we then evaluate the proposal in terms of its risk reward profile to assess the adequacy of the proposed pricing and its potential impact on our overall return on capital as well as our corporate risk objectives 
we have fully integrated our internal actuarial staff into the underwriting and decision making process 
we use in depth actuarial and risk analyses to evaluate contracts prior to authorization 
in addition to internal actuaries and risk professionals  we make use of outside consultants as necessary to develop appropriate analyses for pricing 
separate from our natural catastrophe exposed businesses  we underwrite and accept casualty and specialty insurance and reinsurance business 
we apply the same standards with respect to actuarial and risk analysis to these businesses using commercial data and models licensed from various professional service firms 
as with our natural catastrophe exposed businesses  we seek to identify those casualty and specialty exposures that are most likely to be simultaneously influenced by significant events 
these exposures are then jointly tracked to ensure that we do not develop an excessive accumulation of exposure to that particular type of event 
in addition to the above technical and analytical practices  our underwriters use a variety of tools  including specific contract terms  to manage our exposure to loss 
these include occurrence limits  aggregate limits  reinstatement provisions and loss ratio caps 
additionally  our underwriters use appropriate exclusions  terms and conditions to further eliminate particular risks or exposures that our underwriting team deems to be outside of the intent of the coverage we are willing to offer 
our bermuda underwriting location provides us with a particular advantage for certain lines of business because there are no regulatory limitations upon our use of coverage restrictions in insurance policies 
in our crop insurance business  we have invested in an experienced team of crop  commodity and economic analysts who have developed proprietary tools to manage risk  pricing and exposure in this business 
these proprietary tools are constructed from databases that involve a comprehensive set of historical profit and loss experience data developed at a crop  state  county and farm level of detail 
we further analyze this data based on current and forecasted crop growing conditions  agriculture commodity prices  and market conditions in an effort to produce attractive returns 
in certain cases  the risks assumed by the company are partially reinsured with third party reinsurers 
reinsurance ceded varies by segment and line of business based on a number of factors  including market conditions 
the benefits of ceding risks include reducing exposure on individual risks  protecting against catastrophic risks  maintaining acceptable capital ratios  enabling the writing of additional business and ensuring our insurance businesses are of sufficient size to be considered a lead market for their products 
reinsurance ceded does not legally discharge the company from its liabilities to the original policyholder in respect of the risk being reinsured 
for more information on the company s reinsurance ceded  please see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ceded reinsurance and note reinsurance in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of the company 

table of contents catastrophe risk management to achieve our catastrophe risk management objectives  we utilize a variety of proprietary and commercially available tools to quantify and monitor the various risks we accept as a company 
we have licensed catastrophe modeling software from the principal modeling firms  including rms and air 
these software tools use exposure data provided by our insureds and ceding company clients to simulate catastrophic losses 
we take an active role in the evaluation of these commercial catastrophe models  providing feedback to the modeling companies to improve the efficiencies of these models 
we also supplement the model output in certain territories with the results of our proprietary models 
we use modeling not just for the underwriting of individual transactions but also to optimize the total return and risk of our underwriting portfolio 
we have high standards for the quality and levels of detailed exposure data provided by our clients and have an expressed preference for data at the zip code or postal code level or finer 
data provided at more summary levels  such as counties or cresta zones  is conservatively modeled and surcharged for increased uncertainty 
we require significant amounts of data from our clients and decline business in which we feel the data provided is insufficient to make an appropriate analysis 
our commitment to detailed exposure data has precluded significant involvement as a retrocessionaire in the current market 
data output from the software described above is incorporated in our proprietary models 
our proprietary systems include those for modeling risks associated with property catastrophe  healthcare liability  aerospace and marine  agriculture  property and workers compensation business  various casualty and specialty pricing models as well as our proprietary portfolio risk management and capital allocation models 
these systems allow us to monitor our pricing and risk on a contract by contract basis in each of our segments and business lines 
data output from both our licensed and proprietary software models is used to estimate the amount of premium that is required to pay the long term expected losses under the proposed contracts 
the data output is also used to estimate correlation between both new business and our existing portfolio 
the degree of correlation is used to estimate the incremental capital required to support our participation on each proposed risk  allowing us to calculate a return on consumed capital 
finally  the data output is used to monitor and control our cumulative exposure to individual perils across all of our businesses 
our pricing of catastrophe reinsurance contracts is based on a combination of modeled loss estimates  actual ceding company loss history  surcharges for potential unmodeled exposures  fixed and variable expense estimates and profit requirements 
the profit requirements are based on incremental capital usage estimates described above and on our required return on consumed capital 
loss reserving risk management establishing reserves for losses and loss expenses  in particular reserves for the company s long tail lines of business  constitutes a significant risk for the company 
loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability  but instead are estimates of what the company expects the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost 
to the extent the company determines that actual losses and loss expenses exceed the loss reserves recorded in our financial statements  the company will be required to increase its reserve for losses and loss expenses which in turn could cause a material reduction in the company s profitability and capital 
the company manages the risk inherent in estimating the company s reserves for losses and loss expenses in a variety of ways 
first  the company underwrites a balanced and diversified portfolio of business  which reduces the company s susceptibility to reserving errors that may be associated with any one line or type of business 
in  the company s largest single line of business represented of the gross premiums written by the company 
second  where loss development uncertainty exists  the company makes select use of the purchase of reinsurance to reduce the company s exposure to such loss development uncertainty  in particular in our insurance lines of business 
third  the company incorporates uncertainty in loss trends into its underwriting pricing process 
finally  in its reinsurance business  the company conducts active  regular audits of its ceding company clients with the intent of identifying quickly and thoroughly exposures assumed by the company 
the company s reserving process also serves to mitigate the risk associated with the company s loss and loss expense reserve estimates 
the company seeks to base its loss reserve estimates upon actuarial and statistical projections derived from the most recently available data  as well as current information on future trends in claims severity and frequency  judicial theories of liability and other factors 
the company continually refines both its loss reserve estimates and the means by which its loss reserve estimates are derived  incorporating an ongoing process of developing loss experience  reported claims and claims settlements 

table of contents investment risk management investment risk encompasses the risk of loss in our investment portfolio potentially caused by the adverse impact on our invested assets from fluctuations in interest rates  equity prices  credit spreads  foreign currency rates and other market changes 
the company manages its investment risks through both a system of limits and a strategy to optimize the interaction of risks and opportunities 
to ensure diversification of the company s investment portfolio and avoid aggregation of risks  limits on asset types  economic sector exposure  industry exposure and individual security exposure are placed on our investment portfolio  and monitored on an ongoing basis 
the company manages its interest rate risk through an asset liability management strategy that involves the selection of investments with appropriate characteristics  such as duration  yield  currency and liquidity that are tailored to the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of our liabilities and the anticipated interest rate environment 
the company manages foreign currency risk by seeking to match the company s liabilities under insurance and reinsurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies with assets including cash and investments that are denominated in such currencies 
in order to limit the company s exposure to credit risk  the company s investment policy is to invest primarily in debt instruments of high credit quality issuers and to limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to particular ratings categories and any one issuer 
the company investment policy sets limits for individual credit exposures based on credit rating 
the company uses a number of capital at risk models  which include volatility scenario based measures and value at risk var and credit impairment calculations to evaluate its investment portfolio risk 
volatility scenario based measures are used in order to stress test the portfolio for expected changes in specific market scenarios 
var is a probabilistic method of measuring the potential loss in portfolio value over a given time period and for a given distribution of historical returns 
portfolio risk  as measured by var  is affected by four primary risk factors asset concentration  asset volatility  asset correlation and systematic risk 
for a one year period over of the time  assuming the risks taken into account in the var model perform in accordance with their historical tendencies  the investment portfolio loss for a year period was expected to be less than or equal to at december  the company adjusts its scenarios for a variety of extremes as well as expected outcomes 
management continuously evaluates the applicability and relevance of the models used and makes adjustments as necessary to reflect actual market conditions and performance over time 
operational risk management operational risk represents the risk of loss as a result of inadequate or failed internal processes  system failures  human error or external events 
operational risks include  for example  employee or third party fraud  business interruptions  inaccurate processing of transactions  information technology failures  the loss of key employees without appropriate successors  and non compliance with reporting obligations 
the company seeks to mitigate operational risks through the application of strong process controls throughout our business 
key process controls include underwriting authority letters  underwriting referral protocols  claims procedures guidelines  financial reporting controls and procedures  information technology procedures  the disaster recovery plan and the business continuity plan 
the company s internal audit department and operational audit personnel rigorously test the company s various process controls on a regular basis 
the use by the company of the services of unaffiliated third parties exposes the company to heightened operational risks  including the risk of information technology and physical security breaches  fraud  non compliance with laws and regulations or internal guidelines and inadequate service 
the company mitigates the operational risk posed by the use of third party vendors by verifying  among other items  a potential third party vendor s financial stability  ability to provide ongoing service  business continuity planning and its business reputation 
the company also allocates appropriate resources to monitor any significant third party relationships 
role of the board of directors in risk management the company s board of directors administers its risk oversight of the company through quarterly meetings of its risk committee with members of senior management  including representatives from the actuarial  claims  finance  internal audit  investment  legal and underwriting functions within the organization 
the risk committee s members review with senior management the company s enterprise risk management framework and related policies  processes and procedures 

table of contents the risk committee members review with management the methods utilized by the company to identify and quantify risks associated with the company s business and operations and the company s established risk tolerances and evaluate the company s professional development plans for key risk management functions 
in particular  the risk committee members monitor the company s key risks  risk based capital position relative to internal standards and the requirements of the company s regulators and rating agencies and the company s stressed liquidity position based upon a series of adverse cash flow scenarios and periodically approves the level of risk assumed by the company in its underwriting  investment and operational activities 
investments we follow an investment strategy designed to preserve book value growth and generate appropriate risk adjusted returns while providing sufficient liquidity to meet the needs of the company 
the portfolio is designed to diversify risks  including interest rate  credit and structure risks 
our investment portfolio is managed by our chief investment officer and a team of investment professionals 
our investment team is experienced in direct portfolio management  asset allocation  managing external investment manager relationships  risk management and auditing and accounting 
our investment team uses specialized analytical tools to evaluate risk and potential investments to facilitate a risk managed  opportunity oriented approach to investing consistent with the requirements of the company s investment policy 
we utilize external portfolio managers to oversee most of the day to day activities of our investment portfolio  and our investment professionals actively monitor our investment managers performance within the established investment policy of the company 
during  we also began managing a portion of our investment portfolio internally 
internally managed assets were of total invested assets at december  in assessing the quality and risk associated with our investment portfolio  we utilize a number of capital at risk models  which include volatility scenario based measures and value at risk calculations  to manage our aggregate investment risk exposures 
our capital at risk models also include the assessment of risk capital undertaken by standard poor s s p and am best company am best 
volatility scenario based measures are used in order to stress test the portfolio for expected changes in specific market scenarios 
we adjust our scenarios for a variety of extreme as well as expected outcomes 
management continuously evaluates the applicability and relevance of the models used and makes adjustments as necessary to reflect actual market conditions and performance over time 
in addition  management and the board of directors regularly reviews risk budget  investment allocations  risk exposures  expected returns and expected return on capital 
our investment policy establishes authority for our investment activities and specifies risk tolerances and minimum criteria on the overall credit quality and liquidity characteristics of the portfolio 
this includes limitations on the size of certain holdings as well as restrictions on purchasing certain types of securities or investing in certain industries 
our investment managers may be instructed to invest some of the investment portfolio in currencies other than us dollars based upon the business we have written  the currency in which our loss reserves are denominated or regulatory requirements 
our investment policy incorporates a traditional policy limit approach to each type of risk  thus setting a maximum amount of capital that may be exposed at any one time to particular types of securities and investment vehicles 
we develop and maintain an investment risk profile and risk budget  which is reviewed by the investment committee of the company s board of directors and includes estimates of the maximum and expected levels of risk relative to the company s shareholders equity that will be taken over a specified period 
in determining our investment decisions  we consider the impact of various catastrophic events on our invested assets  particularly those to which our insurance and reinsurance portfolio may also be exposed  in order to protect our financial position 
the investment risk profile is reviewed by the investment committee and is revised quarterly based on market conditions and developing needs of the company 
in addition  as part of our risk management processes  we maintain a watch list of securities that management considers to be at risk due to industry and or company specific issues and or securities potentially subject to future impairments 
these securities are subjected to further internal analysis to evaluate their underlying structures  credit characteristics and overall industry and security specific fundamentals until they are sold  mature or it is deemed that further review is no longer necessary

table of contents ratings financial strength ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance and reinsurance companies 
endurance holdings and certain of its operating subsidiaries maintain a financial strength rating at moody s of a  with a stable outlook  an am best rating of a excellent  with a stable outlook  and an s p rating of a strong with a stable outlook 
all three ratings agencies conducted reviews of endurance holdings during in addition to our financial strength ratings  debt ratings apply to our debt as well as our preferred stock 
these ratings are assessments of the likelihood that we will make timely payments of principal  interest and preferred share dividends 
our million of senior notes are assigned a senior unsecured debt rating of baa by moody s  bbb by am best and bbb by s p 
our non cumulative preferred shares  series a  are rated baa by moody s  bb by am best and bbb by s p 
the objective of s p s  am best s and moody s rating systems is to provide an opinion of an insurer s or reinsurer s financial strength and ability to meet ongoing obligations to its policyholders and debt holders 
these ratings reflect s p s  am best s and moody s opinions of our capitalization  performance and management  and are not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold the company s securities 
s p maintains a letter rating system ranging from aaa extremely strong to r under regulatory supervision 
within these categories  aaa extremely strong is the highest  followed by aa  aa and aa very strong and a  a and a strong 
publications of s p indicate that the a  a and a ratings are assigned to those companies that  in s p s opinion  have demonstrated strong financial security characteristics  but are somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than are insurers with higher ratings 
these ratings may be changed  suspended  or withdrawn at the discretion of s p 
the rating a strong by s p is the sixth highest of twenty one rating levels 
am best maintains a letter scale rating system ranging from a superior to f in liquidation  and includes separate ratings categories 
within these categories  a superior and a superior are the highest  followed by a excellent and a excellent 
publications of am best indicate that the a and a ratings are assigned to those companies that  in am best s opinion  have demonstrated an excellent ability to meet their obligations to policyholders 
these ratings are subject to periodic review by  and may be revised at the sole discretion of  am best 
the rating a excellent by am best is the third highest of rating levels

within these categories  aaa is the highest  followed by aa and a 
within each of these categories  ratings are further broken down into aa  aa and aa ratings may be changed  suspended  or withdrawn at the discretion of moody s 
the rating a by moody s is the sixth highest of twenty one rating levels 
competition the insurance and reinsurance industries are mature and highly competitive 
insurance and reinsurance companies compete on the basis of many factors  including premium charges  general reputation and perceived financial strength  the terms and conditions of the products offered  ratings assigned by independent rating agencies  speed of claims payments  reputation and experience in the particular risk to be underwritten  the jurisdictions where the reinsurer or insurer is licensed or otherwise authorized  capacity and coverages offered and various other factors 
these factors operate at the individual market participant level and in the aggregate across the insurance and reinsurance industry more generally 
in addition  background economic conditions and variations in the insurance and reinsurance buying practices of insureds and ceding companies  by participant and in the aggregate  contribute to cyclical movements in rates  terms and conditions and may impact industry aggregate financial results 
we compete in the bermuda  us  london and international insurance and reinsurance markets directly with numerous other parties  including established global insurance and reinsurance companies  start up insurance and reinsurance entities  as well as potential capital markets and securitization structures aimed at managing catastrophe and other risks 
many of these entities have significantly larger amounts of capital and more employees than we maintain and have established long term and continuing business relationships throughout the industry  which can be a significant competitive advantage 
employees as of december   we had full time employees 
we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory 
none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements 

table of contents item a 
risk factors before investing in any of our securities  you should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information set forth in this annual report on form k 
these risks could materially affect our business  results of operations or financial condition and cause the trading price of our securities to decline 
you could lose all or part of your investment 
the headings used in this section are solely to aid the reader as to general categories of risks related to investing in the company 
many of the risk factors listed apply to more than one category or the company generally 
accordingly  the headings used in this section should not be construed as limiting in any manner the general applicability of any of the risk factors included in this section 
underwriting risks as a property  agriculture and catastrophe insurer and reinsurer  we are particularly vulnerable to losses from catastrophes 
our property  agriculture and catastrophe insurance and reinsurance lines expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes 
catastrophes can be caused by various unpredictable events  including earthquakes  hurricanes  hailstorms  droughts  severe weather  floods  fires  tornadoes  volcano eruptions  explosions and other natural or man made disasters 
many scientists believe that the earth s atmospheric and oceanic temperatures are increasing and that  in recent years  changing climate conditions have increased the unpredictability  severity and frequency of natural disasters in certain parts of the world 
the global geographic distribution of our business subjects us to catastrophe exposure for natural events occurring in a number of areas throughout the world  including  but not limited to  windstorms in the united kingdom and continental europe  hurricanes in florida  the gulf coast and the atlantic coast regions of the united states  typhoons and earthquakes in japan  earthquakes in california and the pacific northwest and new madrid region of the united states and drought  hail  tornado and flooding in the midwestern united states 
from time to time  we may have greater exposures in one or more of these geographic areas than our overall share of the worldwide market might suggest 
accordingly  when and if catastrophes occur in these areas  we may experience relatively more severe negative results from such events than our competitors may 
in particular  the company has historically had a relatively large percentage of its coverage exposures concentrated in the states of california and florida 
in addition  changing climate conditions  primarily rising global temperatures  may be increasing  or may in the future increase the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes  including weather events  and may create new types of catastrophe losses 
we expect that increases in the values and concentrations of insured property will increase the severity of such occurrences in the future 
in the event that we experience catastrophe losses  there is a possibility that our premiums will be inadequate to cover these risks 
in addition  because accounting regulations do not permit insurers and reinsurers to reserve for such catastrophic events until they occur  claims from catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  the estimation of reserves related to hurricanes can be affected by the inability to access portions of the affected areas  the complexity of factors contributing to the losses  legal and regulatory uncertainties and the nature of the information available to establish the reserves 
complex factors include but are not limited to determining whether damage was caused by flooding versus wind  evaluating general liability and pollution exposures  estimating additional living expenses  the impact of demand surge  infrastructure disruption  fraud  the effect of mold damage  business interruption costs  and reinsurance collectability 
the timing of a catastrophe s occurrence  such as at or near the end of a reporting period  can also affect the information available to us in estimating reserves for that reporting period 
the estimates related to catastrophes are adjusted as actual claims emerge and additional information becomes available 
our ability to write new business also could be adversely impacted 
although we attempt to manage our exposure to such events through the use of underwriting controls and the purchase of third party reinsurance  catastrophic events are inherently unpredictable and the actual nature of such events when they occur could be more frequent or severe than contemplated in our pricing and risk management expectations 
as a result  the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents as a property and casualty insurer and reinsurer  we could face losses from war  terrorism and political unrest 
we may have substantial exposure to losses resulting from acts of war  acts of terrorism and political instability 
these risks are inherently unpredictable  although recent events may lead to increased frequency and severity 
it is difficult to predict their occurrence with statistical certainty or to estimate the amount of loss an occurrence will generate 
accordingly  it is possible that our loss reserves will be inadequate to cover these risks 
we closely monitor the amount and types of coverage we provide for terrorism risk under insurance policies and reinsurance treaties 
we often seek to exclude terrorism when we cannot reasonably evaluate the risk of loss or charge an appropriate premium for such risk 
even in cases where we have deliberately sought to exclude coverage  we may not be able to eliminate our exposure to terrorist acts  and thus it is possible that these acts will have a material adverse effect on us 
the risks associated with property and casualty reinsurance underwriting could adversely affect us 
because we participate in property and casualty reinsurance markets  the success of our underwriting efforts depends  in part  upon the policies  procedures and expertise of the ceding companies making the original underwriting decisions 
we face the risk that these ceding companies may fail to accurately assess the risks that they assume initially  which  in turn  may lead us to inaccurately assess the risks we assume 
if we fail to establish and receive appropriate premium rates  we could face significant losses on these contracts 
the terms of the federal multiple peril crop insurance program may change and adversely impact us 
we are one of companies that currently participate in the us federal multi peril crop insurance program mpci sponsored by the risk management agency of the us department of agriculture the rma 
as a result of our acquisition of armtech in december of  crop insurance premiums  which are primarily driven by mpci  have become an increasingly larger portion of our business  totaling million of gross premiums written in  and representing of the total gross premiums written in our insurance segment in the rma periodically reviews and proposes changes to the standard reinsurance agreement sra and such changes to the sra could adversely affect the financial results of crop insurers such as armtech 
as an agriculture insurer  we could face losses from commodity price volatility 
a significant portion of our agriculture insurance business provides revenue protection to farmers for their expected crop revenues  which can be affected by changes in crop prices 
we face the risk that significant losses could be incurred in the event of a decline in the applicable commodity prices prior to harvest 
while this risk is partially mitigated by policyholder retentions  it is possible that large declines in the commodity prices of the major crops we insure  including corn  soybeans  cotton and wheat  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition if we are unable to cost effectively reinsure these risks or enter into applicable commodity price hedges 
if actual renewals of our existing policies and contracts do not meet expectations  our gross premiums written in future years and our future results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our insurance policies and reinsurance contracts are generally for a one year term 
in our financial forecasting process  we make assumptions about the renewal of our prior year s policies and contracts 
if actual renewals do not meet expectations  our gross premiums written in future years and our future results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
this risk is especially prevalent in the first quarter of each year when a large number of insurance and reinsurance contracts are subject to renewal 
the ongoing development of our us based insurance operations is subject to increased risk from changing market conditions 
excess and surplus lines insurance is a substantial portion of the business written by our us based insurance operations 
excess and surplus lines insurance covers risks that are typically more complex and unusual than standard risks and require a high degree of specialized underwriting 
as a result  excess and surplus lines risks do not often fit the underwriting criteria of standard insurance carriers 
our excess and surplus lines insurance business fills the insurance needs of businesses with unique characteristics and is generally considered higher risk than those in the standard market 
if our underwriting staff inadequately judges and prices the risks associated with the business underwritten in the excess and surplus lines market  our financial results could be adversely impacted 

table of contents further  the excess and surplus lines market is significantly affected by the conditions of the property and casualty insurance market in general 
the impact of this cyclicality can be more pronounced in the excess and surplus market than in the standard insurance market 
during times of hard market conditions when market conditions are more favorable to insurers  as rates increase and coverage terms become more restrictive  business tends to move from the admitted market to the excess and surplus lines market and growth in the excess and surplus market can be significantly more rapid than growth in the standard insurance market 
when soft market conditions are prevalent when market conditions are less favorable to insurers  standard insurance carriers tend to loosen underwriting standards and expand market share by moving into business lines traditionally characterized as excess and surplus lines  exacerbating the effect of rate decreases 
if we fail to manage the cyclical nature and volatility of the revenues and profit we generate in the excess and surplus lines market  our financial results could be adversely impacted 
the failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or on our results of operations 
we seek to limit our loss exposure by writing many of our insurance and reinsurance contracts on an excess of loss basis  adhering to maximum limitations on policies written in defined geographical zones  limiting program size for each client  establishing per risk and per occurrence limitations for each event  employing coverage restrictions and following prudent underwriting guidelines for each program written 
in the case of proportional treaties  we seek per occurrence limitations or loss ratio caps to limit the impact of losses from any one event 
most of our direct liability insurance policies include maximum aggregate limitations 
we also seek to limit our loss exposure through geographic diversification 
disputes relating to coverage and choice of legal forum may also arise 
as a result  various provisions of our policies  such as limitations or exclusions from coverage or choice of forum  may not be enforceable in the manner we intend and some or all of our other loss limitation methods may prove to be ineffective 
underwriting is a matter of judgment  involving important assumptions about matters that are inherently unpredictable and beyond our control  and for which historical experience and probability analysis may not provide sufficient guidance 
one or more future catastrophic or other events could result in claims that substantially exceed our expectations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our results of operations  possibly to the extent of eliminating our shareholders equity 
we may be unable to purchase reinsurance and our net income could be reduced or we could incur a net loss in the event of an unusual loss experience 
we purchase reinsurance if it is deemed prudent from a risk mitigation perspective or if it is expected to have a favorable cost benefit relationship relative to our retained risk portfolio 
changes in the availability and cost of reinsurance  which are subject to market conditions that are outside of our control  may reduce to some extent our ability to use reinsurance to balance exposures across our reinsurance or insurance operations 
accordingly  we may not be able to obtain our desired amounts of reinsurance 
in addition  even if we are able to obtain such reinsurance  we may not be able to negotiate terms that we deem appropriate or acceptable or obtain such reinsurance from entities with satisfactory creditworthiness 
we are also subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurers because the transfer of risk to a reinsurer does not relieve us of our liability to our clients 
if our reinsurance companies experience financial difficulties  they may be unable to pay us 
in addition  reinsurers may be unwilling to pay us  even though they are able to do so 
the failure of one or more of the our reinsurers to honor their obligations to us in a timely fashion would impact our cash flow and reduce our net income and  depending upon the amount of reinsurance we have purchased  could cause us to incur a significant loss 
a decline in our financial strength ratings could affect our standing among brokers and customers and cause our premiums and earnings to decrease 
financial strength ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance and reinsurance companies 
we currently maintain an am best financial strength rating of a excellent with a stable outlook and an s p financial strength rating of a strong with a stable outlook 
because all of our ratings are subject to continual review  the retention of these ratings cannot be assured 
if our ratings are reduced from their current level by am best or s p  our competitive position in the insurance and reinsurance industry would suffer 
such a downgrade may have a material negative impact on our ability to expand our insurance and reinsurance portfolio and renew our existing insurance and reinsurance policies and agreements  require us to establish trusts or post letters of credit for ceding company clients  and could trigger provisions allowing some ceding company clients to terminate their reinsurance contracts with us on terms disadvantageous to us 
in addition  a downgrade of our am best rating below b two levels below our current rating would constitute an event of default under our bank credit facility 
each of the effects of a downgrade of our financial strength rating described above could make it more expensive or otherwise difficult for us to compete in certain business segments in which we would otherwise desire to operate 
if this were to occur  we could suffer a material and adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations  and the market price for our securities  including any ordinary shares  could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents it is possible that rating agencies may in the future heighten the level of scrutiny they apply when analyzing companies in our industry  may increase the frequency and scope of their reviews  may request additional information from the companies that they rate  and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in their models for maintenance of certain rating levels 
we cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take  or what actions we may take in response to the actions of rating agencies  which could adversely affect our business 
as with other companies in the financial services industry  our ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice 
profitability may be adversely impacted by inflation 
the effects of inflation could cause the cost of claims from catastrophes or other events to rise in the future 
our reserve for losses and loss expenses includes assumptions about future payments for settlement of claims and claims handling expenses  such as medical treatments and litigation costs 
to the extent inflation causes these costs to increase above reserves established for these claims  we will be required to increase our loss reserves with a corresponding reduction in our net income in the period in which the deficiency is identified 
adverse changes to the economy in the countries in which we operate could lower the demand for our insurance and reinsurance products and could have a materially adverse effect on the profitability of our operations 
factors such as consumer spending  business investment  government spending  the volatility and strength of the capital markets  and inflation all affect the business and economic environment and  indirectly  the amount and profitability of our business 
in an economic environment characterized by higher unemployment  lower family income  lower corporate earnings  lower business investment and lower consumer spending  the demand for insurance products could be adversely affected 
adverse changes in the economy could potentially lead our customers to have less need for insurance coverage  to cancel existing insurance policies  modify coverage or to not renew with us  and our premium revenue could be adversely affected 
challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay premiums as they come due 
since we depend on a few brokers for a large portion of our revenues  loss of business provided by any one of them could adversely affect us 
we market our insurance and reinsurance worldwide through insurance and reinsurance brokers 
in the year ended december   our top three brokers represented approximately of our net premiums written 
loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by one or more of these brokers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our reliance on brokers subjects us to their credit risk 
in accordance with industry practice  we frequently pay amounts owed on claims under our insurance or reinsurance contracts to brokers  and these brokers  in turn  pay these amounts to the clients that have purchased insurance or reinsurance from us 
if a broker fails to make such a payment  in a significant majority of business that we write  it is highly likely that we will be liable to the client for the deficiency because of local laws or contractual obligations  notwithstanding the broker s obligation to make such payment 
likewise  when the client pays premiums for these policies to brokers for payment over to us  these premiums are considered to have been paid and  in most cases  the client will no longer be liable to us for those amounts  whether or not we have actually received the premiums 
consequently  we assume a degree of credit risk associated with brokers around the world with respect to most of our insurance and reinsurance business 
to date we have not experienced any losses related to such credit risks 
the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain 
as industry practices and legal  judicial  social and other environmental conditions change  unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge 
these issues may adversely affect our business by either broadening coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
in some instances  these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued insurance or reinsurance contracts that are affected by the changes 
as a result  the full extent of liability under our insurance or reinsurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued 

table of contents recent examples of emerging claims and coverage issues include larger settlements and jury awards for professionals and corporate directors and officers covered by professional liability and directors and officers liability insurance  initial rollback of tort reform caps and other limitations in various states possibly increasing jury awards in medical malpractice  auto and other liability exposures  a growing trend of plaintiffs targeting property and casualty insurers in purported class action litigations relating to claims handling  insurance sales practices and other practices related to the conduct of our business  and uncertainties associated with liability coverages related to sub prime mortgage and general credit crisis exposures 
the effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict and could harm our business 
we operate in a highly competitive environment which could adversely impact our operating margins 
the insurance and reinsurance industries are highly competitive 
we compete with major us and us insurers and reinsurers  including other bermuda based insurers and reinsurers 
many of our competitors have greater financial  marketing and management resources 
in addition  we may not be aware of other companies that may be planning to enter the segments of the insurance and reinsurance market in which we operate or of existing companies that may be planning to raise additional capital 
increasing competition could result in fewer submissions  lower premium rates and less favorable policy terms and conditions  which could have a material adverse impact on our growth and profitability 
further  insurance risk linked securities and derivative and other non traditional risk transfer mechanisms and vehicles are being developed and offered by other parties  including non insurance company entities  which could impact the demand for traditional insurance or reinsurance 
a number of new  proposed or potential industry or legislative developments could further increase competition in our industry 
new competition from these developments could cause the demand for insurance or reinsurance to fall or the expense of customer acquisition and retention to increase  either of which could have a material adverse affect on our growth and profitability 
the historical cyclicality of the property and casualty reinsurance industry may cause fluctuations in our results 
historically  property and casualty insurers and reinsurers have experienced significant fluctuations in operating results due to competition  frequency of occurrence or severity of catastrophic events  levels of capacity  general economic conditions and other factors 
demand for insurance and reinsurance is influenced significantly by prevailing general economic conditions and  in the case of reinsurance  the underwriting results of primary property and casualty insurers 
the supply of insurance and reinsurance is related to prevailing prices  the levels of insured losses and the levels of industry surplus which  in turn  may fluctuate in response to changes in rates of return on investments being earned in the insurance and reinsurance industry 
as a result  the insurance and reinsurance business historically has been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted favorable premium levels 
the continued strengthening of the industry s surplus position in and the establishment of new market entrants within the past five years has increased the supply of insurance and reinsurance and has caused insurance and reinsurance prices in many of the markets in which we participate to decrease since any of these factors could lead to a significant reduction in premium rates  less favorable policy terms and fewer submissions for insurance and reinsurance coverage 
in addition to these considerations  changes in the frequency and severity of losses suffered by insureds and cedants may affect the cycles of the insurance and reinsurance business significantly 
to the extent these trends continue  our financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents investment risks we are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk  including changes in interest rates  credit spreads and foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
we are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk  including changes in interest rates  credit spreads  equity prices  real estate markets  foreign currency exchange rates  market volatility  the performance of the economy in general  the performance of the specific issuers included in our portfolio and other factors outside our control 
our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates 
a rise in interest rates  in the absence of other countervailing changes  will increase the net unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio 
in the event that our estimate of our liability cash flow profile is inaccurate  we may be forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a loss in order to cover the liability 
although we take measures to manage the economic risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment  we may not be able to adequately mitigate the interest rate risk of our assets relative to our liabilities  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
our exposure to credit spreads primarily relates to market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in credit spreads 
if issuer credit spreads widen or increase significantly over an extended period of time  it may result in a net unrealized loss position in our investment portfolio 
if credit spreads tighten significantly  it will reduce net investment income associated with new purchases of fixed maturity investments 
our primary foreign currency exchange risks are related to net income from foreign operations  non us dollar denominated investments and investments in foreign subsidiaries 
in general  the weakening of foreign currencies versus the us dollar will unfavorably affect net income from foreign operations  the value of non us dollar denominated investments  and investments in foreign subsidiaries 
a portion of our investment portfolio is allocated to other investments which we expect to have different risk characteristics than our investments in traditional fixed maturity investments and short term investments  which in turn could result in a material adverse change to our investment performance  and accordingly adversely affect our financial results 
a portion of our investment portfolio is allocated to other investments  both alternative funds and high yield loan funds  which we expect to have different risk characteristics than our investments in traditional fixed income securities and short term investments 
our alternative funds include investments in funds which invest in senior secured bank debt and high yield securities  distressed debt  distressed real estate  derivatives and equity long short strategies and constituted of the carrying value of our cash and invested assets as of december  as of december   we are committed to potential future capital calls in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
our high yield loan funds constituted of the carrying value of our cash and invested assets as of december  the amount and timing of net investment income from such other investments tends to be uneven as a result of the performance of the underlying investments 
the timing of distributions from these investments  which depends on particular events relating to the underlying investments  as well as the funds schedules for making distributions and their needs for cash  can be difficult to predict 
as a result  the amount of net investment income that we record from these investments can vary substantially from quarter to quarter 
many of the investments are subject to restrictions on redemptions and sales that limit our ability to liquidate these investments in the short term 
these investments expose us to market risks including interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  equity price risk and credit risk 
in addition  we typically do not hold the underlying securities of these investments in our custody accounts 
as a result  we generally do not have the ability to quantify the risks associated with these investments in the same manner for which we have for our fixed income portfolio 
the performance of these investments is also dependent on the individual investment managers and their investment strategies 
it is possible that the investment managers will leave and or the investment strategies will become ineffective 
any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse change to our investment performance  and accordingly adversely affect our financial results 

table of contents losses due to defaults by others  including issuers of investment securities which include structured securities such as commercial mortgage backed securities and residential mortgage backed securities or high yielding bonds  and reinsurance counterparties could adversely affect the value of our investments  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
issuers or borrowers whose securities or loans we hold  customers  reinsurers  clearing agents  exchanges  clearing houses and other financial intermediaries and guarantors may default on the principal and interest they owe to us due to bankruptcy  insolvency  lack of liquidity  adverse economic conditions  operational failure  fraud or other reasons 
we are also subject to the risk that the underlying collateral within loan backed securities  including mortgage backed and asset backed securities  may default on principal and interest payments causing an adverse change in cash flows paid to us 
at december   the fixed income portfolio of billion represented of our total cash and invested assets 
the occurrence of a major economic downturn  acts of corporate malfeasance  widening risk spreads  or other events that adversely impact the issuers  guarantors or underlying collateral of these securities could cause the value of our fixed income portfolio and our net income to decline and the default rate of the fixed maturity investments to increase 
a ratings downgrade affecting issuers or guarantors of particular securities  or similar trends that could worsen the credit quality of issuers  such as the corporate issuers of securities in our investment portfolio  could also have a similar effect 
with economic uncertainty  credit quality of issuers or guarantors could be adversely affected 
similarly  a ratings downgrade affecting a loan backed security we hold could indicate the credit quality of that security has deteriorated 
any event reducing the value of these securities other than on a temporary basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
levels of write down or impairment are impacted by our assessment of the intent and ability to hold securities which have declined in value and whether such declines in the company s value below amortized cost are due to credit related factors 
we have also engaged third party investment managers to provide us with investment advisory and management services 
it is possible that the investment strategies employed by these third party investment managers may become ineffective or that such managers will fail to follow our investment guidelines  which could result in a material adverse change to our investment performance  and accordingly adversely affect our financial results 
our participation in a securities lending program subjects us to potential liquidity and other risks 
we participate in a securities lending program whereby securities  including fixed income investments  are loaned by us to third parties 
we retain all economic interest in the securities we lend  retain the earnings and cash flows associated with the loaned securities and receive a fee from the borrower for the temporary use of the securities 
we require collateral in the form of cash  government securities and or letters of credit at a rate of of the market value of the loaned securities 
we invest such collateral in other securities  primarily overnight repurchase agreements 
returns of loaned securities by the third parties would require us to return the collateral associated with such loaned securities 
in addition  in some cases  the maturity of the securities held as invested collateral ie  securities that we have purchased with collateral received from the third parties may exceed the term of the related securities on loan and the market value may fall below the amount received as collateral and invested 
if we are required to return significant amounts of collateral on short notice and we are forced to sell securities to meet the return obligation  we may have difficulty selling such collateral that is invested in securities in a timely manner  be forced to sell securities in a volatile or illiquid market for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize under normal market conditions  or both 
in addition  under stressful capital market and economic conditions  liquidity broadly deteriorates  which may further restrict our ability to sell securities 
the determination of the other than temporary impairments taken on our investments is highly subjective and could materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
the determination of the amount of other than temporary impairments taken on our investments varies by investment type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class as well as an analysis on a security by security basis 
such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available 
management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects impairments in operations as such evaluations are revised 
during periods of market disruption including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates  rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity  it may be difficult to value certain of our securities  for example mortgage backed securities  if trading becomes less frequent or market data becomes less observable 
in addition  there may be certain asset classes that were in active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid 
in such cases  more securities may fall to level and thus require more subjectivity and management judgment 
as such  valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation as well as valuation methods  which are more sophisticated or require greater estimation thereby resulting in values which may differ materially from the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold 
further  rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements and the period to period changes in value could vary significantly 
decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents there can be no assurance that our management has accurately assessed the level of impairments taken in our financial statements 
furthermore  additional impairments may need to be taken in the future  which could materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments 
some of our investments are relatively illiquid and are in asset classes that may experience significant market valuation fluctuations 
we hold certain investments that may lack liquidity  such as our alternative funds and high yield loan funds 
if we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of normal cash requirements or are required to post or return collateral in connection with our investment portfolio or securities lending activities  we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner  be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize  or both 
the reported value of our relatively illiquid types of investments and  at times  our high quality  generally liquid asset classes  do not necessarily reflect the lowest current market price for the asset 
if we were forced to sell certain of our assets in the current market  there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell them for the prices at which we have recorded them  and we may be forced to sell them at significantly lower prices 
our investment liquidity and investment performance may affect our financial assets and ability to conduct business 
we derive a significant portion of our income from our invested assets 
as a result  our operating results depend in part on the performance of our investment portfolio  which consists primarily of fixed maturity investments 
our income derived from our invested assets including net realized gains losses on investment sales and net impairment losses recognised in earnings was million for the year ended december  our operating results are subject to a variety of investment risks  including risks relating to general economic conditions  market volatility  interest rate fluctuations  liquidity risk and credit and default risk 
in addition  we are subject to pre payment or reinvestment risk as well as restrictions on redemptions or sale of certain of our investments 
with respect to our liabilities  we strive to structure our investments in a manner that recognizes their cash flow profile and our potential liquidity needs 
in that regard  we attempt to correlate the maturity and duration of our investment portfolio to our liability profile 
however  if our liquidity needs or liability profile unexpectedly changes  we may not be successful in continuing to structure our investment portfolio in that manner 
the market value of our fixed income portfolio will be subject to fluctuations depending on changes in various factors  including prevailing interest rates 
to the extent that we are unsuccessful in correlating our investment portfolio with our liabilities  we may be forced to liquidate our investments at times and prices that are not optimal  which could have a material adverse effect on the performance of our investment portfolio 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control 
although we take measures to attempt to manage the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment  we may not be able to mitigate interest rate sensitivity effectively 
a significant increase in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our book value 
liquidity and capital risks our holding company structure and certain regulatory and other constraints affect our ability to pay dividends and make other payments 
endurance holdings is a holding company and  as such  has no substantial operations of its own 
dividends and other permitted distributions from our operating subsidiaries are expected to be endurance holdings primary source of funds to meet ongoing cash requirements  including debt service payments and other expenses  and to pay dividends  if any  to shareholders 
bermuda law and regulations  including  but not limited to  bermuda insurance regulations  restrict the declaration and payment of dividends and the making of distributions by endurance bermuda unless certain regulatory requirements are met 
the inability of endurance bermuda to pay dividends in an amount sufficient to enable endurance holdings to meet its cash requirements at the holding company level could have a material adverse effect on its operations 
in addition  endurance holdings us and us operating subsidiaries are subject to significant regulatory restrictions limiting their ability to declare and pay dividends 
we therefore do not expect to receive material dividends from these operating subsidiaries for the foreseeable future 

table of contents endurance holdings is subject to bermuda regulatory constraints that will affect its ability to pay dividends on its ordinary shares  class a shares and non cumulative preferred shares  series a the series a preferred shares  and to make other payments 
under the bermuda companies act  as amended the companies act  endurance holdings may declare or pay a dividend or make a distribution out of retained earnings or contributed surplus only if it has reasonable grounds for believing that it is  or would after the payment be  able to pay its liabilities as they become due and if the realizable value of its assets would thereby not be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and issued share capital and share premium accounts 
in addition  the terms of our credit facility prohibit endurance holdings from declaring or paying any dividends if a default or event of default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such declaration or payment or would result from such declaration or payment 
in addition  the terms of the series a preferred shares prohibit the declaration or payment of dividends on our ordinary shares unless dividends on the series a preferred shares have been declared and paid 
preference shares  including the series a preferred shares  may also not be redeemed if as a result of the redemption  our issued share capital would be reduced below the minimum capital specified in the memorandum of association of endurance holdings 
we could incur substantial losses and reduced liquidity if one of the financial institutions we use in our operations  including those institutions that participate in our credit facility  fails 
we have exposure to counterparties in many different industries and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment banks  hedge funds and other investment funds and other institutions 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty 
in addition  with respect to secured transactions  our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the obligation 
due to the uncertainty associated with casualty business  current reinsurance recoverables are subject to the credit risk of the reinsurers 
we maintain cash balances  including restricted cash held in premium trust accounts  significantly in excess of the fdic insurance limits at various depository institutions 
we also maintain cash balances in foreign banks and institutions and rely upon funding commitments from several banks and financial institutions that participate in our credit facility 
if one or more of these financial institutions were to fail  our ability to access cash balances or draw down on our credit facility may be temporarily or permanently limited  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
the cost of reinsurance security arrangements may materially impact our margins 
as a bermuda reinsurer  endurance bermuda is required to post collateral security with respect to reinsurance liabilities it assumes from ceding insurers domiciled in the us the posting of collateral security is generally required in order for us ceding companies to obtain credit on their us statutory financial statements with respect to reinsurance liabilities ceded to unlicensed or unaccredited reinsurers  such as endurance bermuda 
under applicable statutory provisions  the security arrangements may be in the form of letters of credit  reinsurance trusts maintained by third party trustees or funds withheld arrangements whereby the trusteed assets are held by the ceding company 
endurance bermuda has the ability to issue up to billion in letters of credit under our letter of credit and revolving credit facility that expires on may  if this facility is not sufficient or if the company is unable to renew this facility or is unable to arrange for other types of security on commercially acceptable terms  the ability of endurance bermuda to provide reinsurance to us based clients may be severely limited 
security arrangements may subject our assets to security interests and or require that a portion of our assets be pledged to  or otherwise held by  third parties 
although the investment income derived from our assets while held in trust typically accrues to our benefit  the investment of these assets is governed by the investment regulations of the state of domicile of the ceding insurer  which may be more restrictive than the investment regulations applicable to us under bermuda law 
the restrictions may result in lower investment yields on these assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

table of contents adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs  access to capital and cost of capital 
our future capital requirements depend on many factors  including our ability to underwrite new business successfully  to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses  and to maintain our current rating agency ratings 
we need liquidity to pay our operating expenses and without sufficient liquidity  we will be forced to curtail our operations  and our business will suffer 
the principal sources of our liquidity are our invested assets 
sources of liquidity in normal markets also include a variety of short and long term instruments  including repurchase agreements  commercial paper  medium and long term debt  junior subordinated debt securities  capital securities and shareholders equity 
in the event current resources do not satisfy our needs  we may have to seek additional financing 
the availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions  the general availability of credit  the volume of trading activities  the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry  our credit ratings and credit capacity  as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long or short term financial prospects if we incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn 
similarly  our access to funds may be impaired if regulatory authorities or rating agencies take negative actions against us 
our internal sources of liquidity may prove to be insufficient  and in such case  we may not be able to successfully obtain additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
disruptions  uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may also limit our access to capital required to operate our business  most significantly our insurance operations 
such market conditions may limit our ability to replace  in a timely manner  maturing liabilities  satisfy statutory capital requirements  generate fee income and market related revenue to meet liquidity needs  and access the capital necessary to grow our business 
as such  we may be forced to delay raising capital  issue shorter tenor securities than we prefer  or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility 
any equity or debt financing  if available at all  may be on terms that are not favorable to us 
in the case of equity financings  dilution to our shareholders could result  and in any case such securities may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our already outstanding securities 
in the case of debt financings  our credit spreads have widened since we previously issued debt securities  which could lead to higher interest costs on new debt 
our results of operations  financial condition  cash flows and statutory capital position could be materially adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets and an inability to obtain adequate capital 
our failure to comply with restrictive covenants contained in the indentures governing our senior notes or our current or future credit facility could trigger prepayment obligations  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that impose restrictions on us and certain of our subsidiaries with respect to  among other things  the incurrence of liens and the disposition of capital stock of these subsidiaries 
in addition  our credit facility requires us and or certain of our subsidiaries to comply with certain covenants  including the maintenance of a minimum consolidated net tangible worth and restrictions on the payment of dividends 
our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default under the indentures or our credit facility  which  if not cured or waived  could result in us being required to repay the notes or any amounts outstanding under the credit facility prior to maturity 
as a result  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
legal and regulatory risks recent or future legislation may decrease the demand for our property catastrophe reinsurance products and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
it is also possible that u 
s states  particularly those with atlantic or gulf coast exposures  may enact new or expanded legislation establishing further state involvement in providing or governing the insurance or reinsurance of catastrophe exposed risks  or may otherwise enact legislation  which would further diminish aggregate private market demand for our products 
alternatively  legislation adversely impacting the private markets could be enacted on a regional or at the federal level 
moreover  we believe that numerous modeled potential catastrophes could exceed the actual or politically acceptable bonded capacity of one or more of the catastrophe funds established by us states  which could lead either to a severe dislocation or the necessity of federal intervention in the markets of one or more of those states  either of which would adversely impact the private insurance and reinsurance industry 

table of contents the regulatory system under which we operate  and potential changes thereto  including heightened scrutiny of issues and practices in the insurance industry could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain necessary licenses  permits  authorizations or accreditations  or may be able to do so only at great cost 
in addition  we may not be able to comply fully with  or obtain appropriate exemptions from  the wide variety of laws and regulations applicable to insurance or reinsurance companies or holding companies 
failure to comply with or to obtain appropriate exemptions under any applicable laws could result in restrictions on our ability to do business in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we operate and fines and other sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the laws and regulations under which we operate  such as the regulations governing our insurance rates and forms  the us multiple peril crop insurance program and the purchase of reinsurance by property insurers in florida  could be revised in a manner materially adverse to the manner in which we conduct our business 
the insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework continues to be subject to increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions  including the us and various states within the us certain government authorities  including state officials in florida  new york and connecticut  have from time to time investigated a number of issues and practices within the insurance industry 
it is possible such scrutiny could include us and it is also possible that these investigations or related regulatory developments could mandate or otherwise give rise to changes in industry practices in a fashion that increases our costs or requires us to alter how we conduct our business 
in addition  if our bermuda insurance or reinsurance operations become subject to the insurance laws of any state in the us  we could face inquiries or challenges to the future operations of these companies 
although surplus lines business is generally less regulated than the admitted market  the regulation of surplus lines insurance may undergo changes in the future 
federal and or state measures may be introduced and promulgated that could result in increased oversight and regulation of surplus lines insurance 
additionally  some recent and pending cases in florida and california courts have raised potentially significant questions regarding surplus lines insurance in those states such as whether surplus lines insurers will be subject to policy form content  filing and approval requirements or additional taxes 
these cases also could foreshadow more extensive oversight of surplus lines insurance by other jurisdictions 
endurance american and endurance risk solutions write insurance on an admitted basis within the us and are subject to extensive regulation under state statutes which confer regulatory  supervisory and administrative powers on state insurance commissioners 
such regulation generally is designed to protect policyholders rather than investors or shareholders of the insurer 
our current or future business strategy could cause one or more of our currently unregulated non insurance subsidiaries to become subject to some form of regulation 
any failure to comply with applicable laws could result in the imposition of significant restrictions on our ability to do business  and could also result in fines and other sanctions  any or all of which could adversely affect our financial results and operations 
we could be required to allocate considerable time and resources to comply with any new or additional regulatory requirements and any such requirements may impact the operations of our insurance and non insurance subsidiaries and ultimately could impact our financial condition as well 
in addition  we could be adversely affected if a regulatory authority believed we had failed to comply with applicable law or regulation 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of the dodd frank act may adversely impact our business 
the us congress and the current administration have made  or called for consideration of  several additional proposals relating to a variety of issues with respect to financial regulation reform  including regulation of the over the counter derivatives market  the establishment of a single state system of licensure for us and foreign reinsurers  regulation of executive compensation and others 
one of those initiatives  the dodd frank act  was signed into law by president obama on july  the dodd frank act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the united states and establishes a federal insurance office under the us treasury department to monitor all aspects of the insurance industry and of lines of business other than certain health insurance  certain long term care insurance and crop insurance 
the director of the federal insurance office will have the ability to recommend that an insurance company or an insurance holding company be subject to heightened prudential standards 
the dodd frank act also provides for the pre emption of state laws in certain instances involving the regulation of reinsurance and other limited insurance matters and established the federal bureau of consumer financial protection the bcfp which will require the bcfp and other federal agencies to implement many new rules 
at this time  it is not possible to predict with any degree of certainty whether any other proposed legislation  rules or regulatory changes will be adopted or what impact  if any  the dodd frank or any other such legislation  rules or changes could have on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
solvency ii could adversely impact our financial results and operations 
solvency ii  a european union directive concerning the capital adequacy  risk management and regulatory reporting for insurers  which was adopted by the european parliament in april of  may adversely affect our re insurance businesses 
implementation of solvency ii by the european commission is expected to take effect january  in the european union member states  and will replace the current solvency requirements 
implementation of solvency ii will require us to utilize a significant amount of resources to ensure compliance 
in addition  the measures implementing solvency ii are currently subject to a consultation process and are not expected to be finalized until late  consequently  our implementation plans are based on our current understanding of the solvency ii requirements  which may change 
the european union is in the process of considering the solvency ii equivalence of bermuda s insurance regulatory and supervisory regime 
the european union equivalence assessment considers whether bermuda s regulatory regime provides a similar level of policyholder protection as provided under solvency ii 
a finding that bermuda s insurance regulatory regime is not equivalent to the european union s solvency ii could have an adverse effect on our reinsurance operations in the european union and on our group solvency calculations 
such a finding could also have adverse indirect commercial impacts on our operations 
we are monitoring the ongoing legislative and regulatory steps following adoption of solvency ii 
the principles  standards and requirements of solvency ii may also  directly or indirectly  impact the future supervision of additional operating subsidiaries of ours 

table of contents operational risks changes in current accounting practices and future pronouncements may materially impact our reported financial results 
unanticipated developments in accounting practices may require us to incur considerable additional expenses to comply with such developments  particularly if it is required to prepare information relating to prior periods for comparative purposes or to apply the new requirements retroactively 
the impact of changes in current accounting practices and future pronouncements cannot be predicted but may affect the calculation of net income  net equity  and other relevant financial statement line items 
for example  the current proposal for the convergence of us gaap with international financial reporting standards ifrs may require the company to prepare financial statements in accordance with ifrs for the year ended december   including comparative information also prepared under ifrs for the two previous years 
also  recent proposals from us and international standard setters have indicated a possible move away from the current insurance accounting models toward a more present value based model which could introduce significant volatility in the earnings of insurance industry participants and significant changes in financial statement disclosures 
our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period and may not be indicative of our long term prospects 
our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
these fluctuations result from a variety of factors  including the seasonality of the reinsurance and insurance business  the volume and mix of reinsurance and insurance products that we write  loss experience on our reinsurance and insurance liabilities  the performance of our investment portfolio and our ability to assess and integrate our risk management strategy effectively 
in particular  we seek to underwrite products and make investments to achieve long term results 
as a result  our short term results of operations may not be indicative of our long term prospects 
if actual claims exceed our reserve for losses and loss expenses  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our success depends upon our ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses that we insure or reinsure 
we establish loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for the payment of all losses and loss expenses incurred with respect to premiums earned on the policies that we write 
loss reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability 
rather  loss reserves are estimates of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost 
these estimates are based upon actuarial and statistical projections and on our assessment of currently available data  as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity and frequency  judicial theories of liability and other factors 
loss reserve estimates are refined continually in an ongoing process as experience develops and claims are reported and settled 
establishing an appropriate level of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process 
moreover  these uncertainties are greater for companies like us than for those with a longer operating history because we do not yet have an extensive loss history 
because of this uncertainty  it is possible that our reserves at any given time will prove inadequate 
to the extent we determine that actual losses and loss expenses exceed our expectations and loss reserves recorded in our financial statements  we will be required to increase our reserve for losses and loss expenses 
this could cause a material reduction in our profitability and capital 
we may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations 
we have made a significant investment in the capitalization of endurance uk  which is denominated in british sterling 
in addition  we enter into reinsurance and insurance contracts where we are obligated to pay losses in currencies other than us dollars 
for the year ended december   approximately of our gross premiums were written in currencies other than the us dollar 
a portion of our cash and cash equivalents  investments and loss reserves are also denominated in non us currencies 
the majority of our operating foreign currency assets and liabilities are denominated in euros  british sterling  canadian dollars  japanese yen and australian dollars 
we may  from time to time  experience losses from fluctuations in the values of these and other non us currencies  which could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
we periodically buy and sell currencies or investment securities denominated in non us dollars in an attempt to match our non us dollar assets to our related non us dollar liabilities 
we currently have no currency hedges in place but may implement hedges in the future 
as part of our asset liability matching strategy  we also consider the use of hedges when we become aware of probable significant losses that will be paid in non us currencies 
however  it is possible that we will not successfully match our exposures or structure the hedges to effectively manage these risks 

table of contents acquisitions or strategic investments that we made or may make could turn out to be unsuccessful 
as part of our strategy  we have pursued and may continue to pursue growth through acquisitions and or strategic investments in new businesses 
the negotiation of potential acquisitions or strategic investments as well as the integration of an acquired business or new personnel could result in a substantial diversion of management resources 
successful integration will depend on  among other things  our ability to effectively integrate acquired businesses or new personnel into our existing risk management techniques  our ability to effectively manage any regulatory issues created by our entry into new markets and geographic locations  our ability to retain key personnel and other operational and economic factors 
there can be no assurance that the integration of acquired business or new personnel will be successful or that the business acquired will prove to be profitable or sustainable 
the failure to integrate successfully or to manage the challenges presented by the integration process may adversely impact our financial results 
acquisitions could involve numerous additional risks such as potential losses from unanticipated litigation or levels of claims and inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs 
our ability to manage our growth through acquisitions or strategic investments will depend  in part  on our success in addressing these risks 
any failure by us to effectively implement our acquisitions or strategic investment strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
operational risks  including systems or human failures  are inherent in business  including ours 
we are subject to operational risks including fraud  employee errors  failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization  failure to comply with regulatory requirements or obligations under our agreements  information technology failures  or external events 
losses from these risks may occur from time to time and may be significant 
as our business and operations grow more complex  we are exposed to more risk in these areas 
our modeling  underwriting and information technology systems are critical to our success 
moreover  our proprietary technology and application systems have been an important part of our underwriting strategy and our ability to compete successfully 
we have also licensed certain systems and data from third parties 
we cannot be certain that we will have access to these  or comparable  service providers  or that our information technology or application systems will continue to operate as intended 
while we have implemented disaster recovery and other business continuity plans  a defect or failure in our internal controls or information technology systems could result in reduced or delayed revenue growth  higher than expected losses  management distraction  or harm to our operations and or our reputation 
we believe appropriate controls and mitigation procedures are in place to prevent significant risk of defect in our internal controls and information technology systems  but internal controls provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance as to the absence of errors or irregularities and any ineffectiveness of such controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business 
since we are dependent on key executives  the loss of any of these executives or our inability to retain other key personnel could adversely affect our business 
our success substantially depends upon our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and upon the ability of our senior management and other key employees to implement our business strategy 
we believe there are only a limited number of available qualified executives in the business lines in which we compete 
we rely substantially upon the services of david s 
cash  chief executive officer  and william m 
jewett  president 
we believe we have been successful in attracting and retaining key personnel since our inception 
the loss of any of their services or the services of other members of our management team or the inability to attract and retain other talented personnel could impede the further implementation of our business strategy  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we do not currently maintain key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our employees 
our business could be adversely affected by bermuda employment restrictions 
we will need to continue to hire employees to work in bermuda 
under bermuda law  non bermudians other than spouses of bermudians may not engage in any gainful occupation in bermuda without an appropriate governmental work permit 
work permits may be granted or extended by the bermuda government upon showing that  after proper public advertisement in most cases  no bermudian or spouse of a bermudian is available who meets the minimum standard requirements for the advertised position 
current bermuda law limits the duration of work permits to six years  with certain exemptions for key employees 
all of our bermuda based professional employees who require work permits  including mr 
jewett  have been granted permits by the bermuda government 
the terms of such permits usually range from three to five years at the time of grant depending on the individual 
it is possible that we could lose the services of one or more of our key employees if we are unable to obtain or renew their work permits  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents corporate risks there are provisions in our charter documents that may reduce or increase the voting rights of our ordinary shares 
the bye laws of endurance holdings generally provide that any shareholder owning  directly  indirectly or  in the case of any us person  by attribution  outstanding ordinary shares possessing more than of the aggregate voting power of our ordinary shares will have their voting rights reduced so that they may not exercise more than of the voting rights conferred by our ordinary shares 
under these provisions  certain shareholders may have their voting rights limited to less than one vote per share  while other shareholders may have voting rights in excess of one vote per share 
moreover  these provisions could have the effect of reducing the votes of certain shareholders who would not otherwise be subject to the limitation by virtue of their direct share ownership 
the bye laws of endurance holdings provide that shareholders will be notified of their voting interests prior to any vote to be taken by the shareholders 
as a result of any reallocation of votes  your voting rights might increase above of the aggregate voting power of the outstanding ordinary shares  thereby possibly resulting in your becoming a reporting person subject to schedule d or g filing requirements under the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
in addition  the reallocation of your votes could result in your becoming subject to filing requirements under section of the exchange act 
we also have the authority to request information from any shareholder for the purpose of determining whether a shareholder s voting rights are to be reallocated pursuant to the bye laws 
if a shareholder fails to respond to a request for information from us or submits incomplete or inaccurate information after a reasonable cure period in response to a request  we may  in our reasonable discretion  reduce or eliminate the shareholder s voting rights 
provisions of endurance holdings bye laws may restrict the ability to transfer shares of endurance holdings 
endurance holdings board of directors may decline to register a transfer of any ordinary shares if the relevant instrument of transfer if any is in favor of five persons or more jointly or is not properly executed  the transferred shares are not fully paid shares or if the transferor fails to comply with all applicable laws and regulations governing the transfer 
a shareholder may be required to sell its shares of endurance 
the bye laws of endurance holdings provide that we have the option  but not the obligation  to require a shareholder to sell its ordinary shares for their fair market value to us  to other shareholders or to third parties if we determine  based on the written advice of legal counsel  that failure to exercise our option would result in non de minimis adverse tax  legal or regulatory consequences to us or certain us persons as to which the shares held by such shareholder constitute controlled shares 
in the latter case  our right to require a shareholder to sell its ordinary shares to us will be limited to the purchase of a number of ordinary shares that will permit avoidance of those adverse tax consequences 
a shareholder may be required to indemnify us for any tax liability that results from the acts of that shareholder 
the bye laws of endurance holdings provide certain protections against adverse tax consequences to us resulting from laws that apply to the shareholders of endurance holdings 
if a shareholder s death or non payment of any tax or duty payable by the shareholder  or any other act or thing involving the shareholder  causes any adverse tax consequences to us i the shareholder or his executor or administrator is required to indemnify us against any tax liability that we incur as a result  ii we will have a lien on any dividends or any other distributions payable to the shareholder by us to the extent of the tax liability and iii if any amounts not covered by our lien on dividends and distributions are owed to us by the shareholder as a result of our tax liability  we have the right to refuse to register any transfer of the shareholder s shares 

table of contents there are regulatory limitations on the ownership and transfer of our ordinary shares 
state laws in the united states and the united kingdom require prior notices or regulatory agency approval of changes in control of an insurer or its holding company 
the insurance laws of the domiciliary jurisdiction provide that no corporation or other person except in certain jurisdictions an authorized insurer may acquire control of a domestic insurance or reinsurance company unless it has given notice and obtained prior written approval of the appropriate regulatory agency 
any purchaser of or more of our ordinary shares could become subject to such regulations and could be required to file certain notices and reports with the insurance commissioners of the domiciliary jurisdictions of our operating companies 
us persons who own our ordinary shares may have more difficulty in protecting their interests than us persons who are shareholders of a us corporation 
the companies act  which applies to endurance holdings and endurance bermuda  differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and their shareholders 
these differences include the manner in which directors must disclose transactions in which they have an interest  the rights of shareholders to bring class action and derivative lawsuits and the scope of indemnification available to directors and officers 
anti takeover provisions in our bye laws could impede an attempt to replace or remove our directors  which could diminish the value of our ordinary shares 
endurance holdings bye laws contain provisions that may entrench directors and make it more difficult for shareholders to replace directors even if the shareholders consider it beneficial to do so 
in addition  these provisions could delay or prevent a change of control that a shareholder might consider favorable 
even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt  these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our ordinary shares if they are viewed as discouraging changes in management and takeover attempts in the future 
it may be difficult to enforce service of process and enforcement of judgments against us and our officers and directors 
endurance holdings is a bermuda company and certain of its officers and directors are residents of jurisdictions outside the united states 
a substantial portion of its assets and its officers and directors  at any one time  are or may be located in jurisdictions outside the united states 
it may be difficult for investors to effect service of process within the united states on our directors and officers who reside outside the united states or to enforce against us or our directors and officers judgments of us courts predicated upon civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws 
there is no treaty in force between the united states and bermuda providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters 
as a result  whether a united states judgment would be enforceable in bermuda against us or our directors and officers depends on whether the us court that entered the judgment is recognized by the bermuda court as having jurisdiction over us or our directors and officers  as determined by reference to bermuda conflict of law rules 
in addition to and irrespective of jurisdictional issues  the bermuda courts will not enforce a united states federal securities law that is either penal or contrary to bermuda public policy 
an action brought pursuant to a public or penal law  the purpose of which is the enforcement of a sanction  power or right at the instance of the state in its sovereign capacity  will not be entertained by a bermuda court 
consequently  certain remedies available under the laws of us jurisdictions  including certain remedies under us federal securities laws  may not be available under bermuda law or enforceable in a bermuda court  as they may be contrary to bermuda public policy 
further  no claim may be brought in bermuda against us or our directors and officers in the first instance for violation of us federal securities laws because these laws have no extraterritorial jurisdiction under bermuda law and do not have force of law in bermuda 
a bermuda court may  however  impose civil liability on us or our directors and officers if the facts alleged in a complaint constitute or give rise to a cause of action under bermuda law 

table of contents taxation risks we may become subject to taxes in bermuda after march   which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
the bermuda minister of finance  under the exempted undertakings tax protection act  as amended  of bermuda  has given endurance holdings and endurance bermuda an assurance that if any legislation is enacted in bermuda that would impose tax computed on profits or income or computed on any capital asset  gain or appreciation  or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax  then the imposition any such tax will not be applicable to endurance holdings  endurance bermuda or any of their respective operations  shares  debentures or other obligations until march  the government of bermuda has announced its intent to extend the protection afforded under the exempted undertakings tax protection act to however  the extension has not yet been enacted into law and there can be no assurance that it will be enacted into law 
accordingly  it is possible that after march  we may be subject to bermuda taxes 
we and our subsidiaries may be subject to us tax which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
endurance holdings and endurance bermuda are bermuda companies and endurance uk is an english company 
endurance holdings  endurance bermuda and endurance uk each intend to operate in such a manner that none of these companies will be deemed to be engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the united states 
nevertheless  because definitive identification of activities which constitute being engaged in a trade or business in the united states is not provided by the internal revenue code code  regulations or court decisions  the internal revenue service irs might successfully contend that any of endurance holdings  endurance bermuda and or endurance uk are is engaged in a trade or business in the united states 
if endurance holdings  endurance bermuda and or endurance uk were was engaged in a trade or business in the united states  and if endurance uk or endurance bermuda was to qualify for benefits under the applicable income tax treaty with the united states  but such trade or business was attributable to a permanent establishment in the united states or in the case of endurance bermuda  with respect to investment income  arguably even if such income was not attributable to a permanent establishment  endurance holdings  endurance uk and or endurance bermuda would be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the income that is effectively connected with the us trade or business  plus an additional branch profits tax in certain circumstances  in which case our financial condition and results of operations and your investment could be materially adversely affected 
holders of endurance holdings ordinary shares or series a preferred shares who own or more of our voting power may be subject to taxation under the controlled foreign corporation cfc rules 
certain us shareholders of a foreign corporation that is considered a controlled foreign corporation a cfc for us federal income tax purposes must include in gross income such us shareholder s pro rata share of the cfc s subpart f income  even if the subpart f income is not distributed 
see material tax considerations certain united states federal income tax considerations united states taxation of holders of ordinary shares and series a preferred shares shareholders who are us persons classification of endurance holdings  endurance uk or endurance bermuda as a controlled foreign corporation 
due to the dispersion of endurance holdings share ownership among holders  its bye law provisions that impose limitations on the concentration of voting power of its shares entitled to vote and authorize endurance holdings to purchase such shares under certain circumstances  and other factors  no us person that owns shares in endurance holdings directly or indirectly through foreign entities should be subject to treatment as a us shareholder of a cfc 
it is possible  however  that the irs could challenge the effectiveness of these provisions and that a court could sustain such a challenge 
accordingly  investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the cfc rules to an investment in endurance holdings 
us persons who hold ordinary shares or series a preferred shares may be subject to us income taxation on their pro rata share of our related party insurance income rpii 
the cfc rules apply to certain insurance and reinsurance companies that earn rpii 
if the rpii rules were to apply to endurance uk or endurance bermuda  a us person who owns ordinary shares or series a preferred shares of endurance holdings directly or indirectly through foreign entities on the last day of the taxable year would be required to include in its income for us federal income tax purposes the shareholder s pro rata share of endurance uk s or endurance bermuda s rpii for the entire taxable year  determined as if such rpii were distributed proportionately to such us shareholders at that date regardless of whether such income is distributed 
in addition  any rpii that is includible in the income of a us tax exempt organization would be treated as unrelated business taxable income 
although endurance uk and endurance bermuda intend to generally operate in a manner so as to qualify for certain exceptions to the rpii rules  there can be no assurance that these exceptions will be available 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that us persons who own ordinary shares or series a preferred shares will not be required to recognize gross income inclusions attributable to rpii 
see material tax considerations certain united states federal income tax considerations united states taxation of holders of ordinary shares and series a preferred shares shareholders who are us persons rpii companies  rpii exceptions 

table of contents the rpii rules provide that if a shareholder who is a us person disposes of shares in a foreign insurance corporation that has rpii and in which us persons collectively own or more of the shares  any gain from the disposition will generally be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the shareholder s share of the corporation s undistributed earnings and profits that were accumulated during the period that the shareholder owned the shares whether or not such earnings and profits are attributable to rpii 
in addition  such a shareholder will be required to comply with certain reporting requirements  regardless of the amount of shares owned by the shareholder 
these rules should not apply to dispositions of ordinary shares or series a preferred shares because endurance holdings will not itself be directly engaged in the insurance business 
the rpii provisions  however  have not been interpreted by the courts or the us treasury department  and regulations interpreting the rpii provisions of the code exist only in proposed form 
accordingly  the irs might interpret the proposed regulations in a different manner and the applicable proposed regulations may be promulgated in final form in a manner that would cause these rules to apply to dispositions of our ordinary shares and series a preferred shares 
see material tax considerations certain united states federal income tax considerations united states taxation of holders of ordinary shares and series a preferred shares shareholders who are us persons disposition of ordinary shares and series a preferred shares  uncertainty as to the application of rpii 
us persons who hold ordinary shares or series a preferred shares will be subject to adverse tax consequences if we are considered a passive foreign investment company a pfic for us federal income tax purposes 
we believe that we should not be considered a pfic for us federal income purposes for the year ended december  moreover  we do not expect to conduct our activities in a manner that would cause us to become a pfic in the future 
however  there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge this position or that a court will not sustain such challenge 
accordingly  it is possible that we could be deemed a pfic by the irs or a court for the year or any future year 
if we were considered a pfic  it could have material adverse tax consequences for an investor that is subject to us federal income taxation  including subjecting the investor to a greater tax liability than might otherwise apply or subjecting the investor to tax on amounts in advance of when tax would otherwise be imposed 
there are currently no regulations regarding the application of the pfic provisions to an insurance company 
new regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying these rules may be forthcoming 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  such guidance would have on a shareholder that is subject to us federal income taxation 
see material tax considerations certain united states federal income tax considerations united states taxation of holders of ordinary shares and series a preferred shares shareholders who are us persons passive foreign investment companies 
changes to us tax legislation could have an adverse impact on us or our shareholders the us congress and the us president obama s administration have discussed from time to time proposals intended to eliminate certain perceived tax advantages of companies including insurance and reinsurance companies that have legal domiciles outside the united states but have certain us connections 
in particular  us president obama s budget for fiscal year includes proposals that would deny a us non life insurance company a deduction for certain non taxed reinsurance premiums paid to affiliates and defer interest deductions related to certain foreign source income 
congress  during prior sessions  has also introduced similar legislation  as well as other proposals relating to tax haven jurisdictions  cross border transactions  intangible products  and a proposal that would treat a foreign corporation that is primarily managed and controlled in the united states as a us corporation for us federal income tax purposes 
we cannot be certain if  when or in what form such legislation may be enacted and whether such legislation  if enacted  would have retroactive effect 
enactment of some versions of such legislation as well as other changes in us tax laws  regulations and interpretations of such legislation or tax law changes to address these issues could adversely affect the results of our operations and financial condition and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd and the european union are considering measures that might increase our taxes and reduce our net income 
the oecd has published reports and launched a global dialogue among member and non member countries on measures to limit harmful tax competition 
these measures are largely directed at counteracting the effects of preferential tax regimes in countries around the world 
in the oecd s report dated april  and updated as of june and november via a global forum  bermuda was not listed as an uncooperative tax haven jurisdiction because it had previously committed to eliminate harmful tax practices and to embrace international tax standards for transparency  exchange of information and the elimination of any aspects of the regimes for financial and other services that attract business with no substantial domestic activity 
bermuda was included in the most recently revised oecd white list with other countries that have substantially implemented the oecd s international tax standards 
we are not able to predict what changes will arise from the commitment or whether such changes will subject us to additional taxes 
regulatory matters general the business of insurance and reinsurance is regulated in most countries  although the degree and type of regulation varies significantly from one jurisdiction to another 
reinsurers are generally subject to less direct regulation than primary insurers

an insurance advisory committee appointed by the bermuda minister of finance the minister advises the bma on matters connected with the discharge of the bma s functions 
sub committees of the insurance advisory committee supervise and review the law and practice of insurance in bermuda  including reviews of accounting and administrative procedures 
the day to day supervision of insurers is the responsibility of the bma 
the bma utilizes a risk based approach when it comes to licensing and supervising insurance companies in bermuda 
as part of the bma s risk based system  an assessment of the inherent risks within each particular class of insurer is utilized in the first instance to determine the limitations and specific requirements which may be imposed 
thereafter  the bma keeps its analysis of relative risk within individual institutions under review on an ongoing basis  including through the scrutiny of regular audited statutory financial statements  and  as appropriate  meeting with senior management during onsite visits 
the initial meetings with senior management and any proposed onsite visit will primarily focus upon companies that are licensed as class  class a  class b and class insurers 
the bma has also adopted guidance notes the guidance notes in order to ensure those operating in bermuda have a good understanding of the nature of the requirements of  and the bma s approach in implementing  the insurance act 
the insurance act imposes solvency and liquidity standards and auditing and reporting requirements on bermuda insurance companies and grants the bma powers to supervise  investigate  require information and the production of documents and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies 
certain significant aspects of the bermuda insurance regulatory framework are set forth below 
in july  the insurance amendment act the amendment act was promulgated  which among other things  created a new supervisory framework for bermuda insurers by establishing new risk based regulatory capital adequacy and solvency margin requirements  including the calculation of a class insurer s enhanced capital requirement ecr as further discussed below 

table of contents the bma continues to make amendments to the insurance act with a view to enhancing bermuda s insurance regime and ensuring that bermuda remains at the vanguard of international standards of insurance 
of particular importance and significance to endurance bermuda are the following recent amendments promulgated in a group wide supervisory regime was introduced with the principle purpose of enabling the bma to form a comprehensive view of the overall exposure of an insurance group  the scope of the bma s powers was extended allowing the bma to make rules in relation to prudential standards to include insurance reserves and eligible capital requirements  and new notification requirements were introduced in respect of a change of shareholder controller  changes to controllers and officers and provisions for insurers to notify the bma of any proposed material change in their business 
additionally  the insurance code of conduct the insurance code became operative on july insurers have until july to comply with the insurance code 
classification of insurers the insurance act distinguishes between insurers carrying on long term business and insurers carrying on general business 
there are six classifications of insurers carrying on general business  with class insurers subject to the strictest regulation 
endurance bermuda  which is incorporated to carry on general insurance and reinsurance business  is registered as a class insurer in bermuda and is regulated as such under the insurance act 
endurance bermuda is not licensed to carry on long term business 
cancellation of insurer s registration an insurer s registration may be canceled by the supervisor of insurance of the bma on certain grounds specified in the insurance act  including failure of the insurer to comply with its obligations under the insurance act or if  in the opinion of the bma after consultation with the insurance advisory committee  the insurer has not been carrying on business in accordance with sound insurance principles 
principal representative an insurer is required to maintain a principal office in bermuda and to appoint and maintain a principal representative in bermuda 
for the purpose of the insurance act  endurance bermuda s principal office is its executive offices in pembroke  bermuda 
michael j 
mcguire has been appointed by the board of directors as endurance bermuda s principal representative and has been approved by the bma 
without a reason acceptable to the bma  an insurer may not terminate the appointment of its principal representative  and the principal representative may not cease to act as such  unless days notice in writing to bma is given of the intention to do so 
a principal representative shall forthwith notify the bma  in such a manner as it may direct  a on his reaching a view that there is a likelihood of the insurer for which he acts becoming insolvent  for instance the failure by the insurer to comply substantially with a condition imposed upon the insurer by the bma relating to a solvency margin or liquidity or other ratio would be a reportable event  b on its coming to his knowledge  or his having reason to believe  that an event to which the applicable section of the insurance act applies has occurred  under the amendment act these events now include i circumstances where a class insurer undergoes a material change to the nature of the business it underwrites  and ii a significant loss which is likely to render the insurer unable to comply with its ecr 
within days of such notification  the principal representative shall furnish the bma with a report in writing setting out all the particulars of the case that are available to him 
independent approved auditor every registered insurer must appoint an independent auditor who will audit and report annually on the statutory financial statements and the statutory financial return of the insurer  both of which  in the case of endurance bermuda  are required to be filed annually with the bma 
endurance bermuda s independent auditor must be approved by the bma and may be the same person or firm that audits endurance holdings consolidated financial statements and reports for presentation to its shareholders 
loss reserve specialist as a registered class insurer  endurance bermuda is required to submit an opinion of its approved loss reserve specialist with its statutory financial return in respect of its losses and loss expenses provisions 
the loss reserve specialist  who will normally be a qualified property and casualty actuary  must be approved by the bma 
michael e 
angelina  chief actuary and chief risk officer for the company  has been appointed by our board of directors and has been approved by the bma to act as endurance bermuda s loss reserve specialist 

table of contents statutory and gaap financial statements an insurer must prepare and file annual statutory financial statements with the bma within four months from the end of the financial year to which they relate 
the insurance act prescribes rules for the preparation and substance of these statutory financial statements which include  in statutory form  a balance sheet  an income statement  a statement of capital and surplus and notes thereto 
the insurer is required to give detailed information and analyses regarding premiums  claims  reinsurance and investments 
the new accounts regime applicable to class insurers includes i a distinct methodology and new format to be applied when preparing and reporting the statutory balance sheet and statutory income statements for class insurers and ii accompanying explanatory notes to be added and instructions affecting each statutory statement 
the most significant aspect of the amended regulations in relation to the statutory balance sheet of class insurers is the reporting obligation to detail  on a line by line basis  specific asset and liability classes  as well as the requirement to identify and distinguish between what is or is not attributable to affiliates of the class insurer 
class insurers are required to prepare and file with the bma audited annual financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap which applies in bermuda  uk  uk  or such other gaap as the bma may recognize or international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the audited financial statements are to be submitted within four months from the end of the financial year to which they relate or  if the class insurer makes an application to the bma  such longer period as may be allowed by the bma but no longer than seven months from the end of the financial year to which they relate 
the bma publishes on its website each such class insurer s gaap or ifrs audited financial statements 
in addition to the audited gaap or ifrs financial statements  class insurers are required to file with the bma statutory financial statements which are not prepared in accordance with us gaap and are distinct from the financial statements prepared for presentation to the insurer s shareholders under the companies act  which financial statements  in the case of the company  will be prepared in accordance with us gaap 
as a general business insurer  endurance bermuda is required to submit the annual statutory financial statements as part of the annual statutory financial return 
the statutory financial statements and the statutory financial return do not form part of the public records maintained by the bma 
annual statutory financial return endurance bermuda is required to file with the bma a statutory financial return no later than four months after its financial year end unless specifically extended upon application to the bma 
the statutory financial return for a class insurer includes  among other matters  a report of the approved independent auditor on the statutory financial statements of the insurer  solvency certificates  the statutory financial statements  the opinion of the loss reserve specialist and a schedule of reinsurance ceded 
the solvency certificates must be signed by the principal representative and at least two directors of the insurer certifying that the minimum solvency margin  as well as the minimum liquidity ratio  has been met and whether the insurer complied with the conditions attached to its certificate of registration 
the independent auditor is required to state whether  in its opinion  it was reasonable for the directors to make these certifications and whether the declaration of the statutory ratios complies with the requirements of the insurance act 
if an insurer s accounts have been audited for any purpose other than compliance with the insurance act  a statement to that effect must be filed with the statutory financial return 
enhanced capital requirement  minimum solvency margin and restrictions on dividends and distributions bermuda s risk based regulatory capital adequacy and solvency margin regime termed the bermuda solvency capital requirement bscr provides a risk based capital model as a tool to assist the bma both in measuring risk and in determining appropriate levels of capitalization 
bscr employs a standard mathematical model that correlates the risk underwritten by bermuda insurers to the capital that is dedicated to their business 
the framework that has been developed  applies a standard measurement format to the risk associated with an insurer s assets  liabilities and premiums  including a formula to take account of the catastrophe risk exposure 
where the insurer believes that its own internal model for measuring risk and determining appropriate levels of capital better reflects the inherent risk of its business  it may apply to the bma for approval to use its internal capital model in substitution for the bscr model 
the bma may approve an insurer s internal model provided certain conditions have been established and may revoke approval of an internal model in the event that the conditions are no longer met or where it feels that the revocation is appropriate 
the bma will review the internal model regularly to confirm that the model continues to meet the conditions 

table of contents in order to minimise the risk of a shortfall in capital arising from an unexpected adverse deviation  the bma seeks that insurers operate at or above a threshold capital level termed the target capital level tcl  which exceeds the bscr or approved internal model minimum amounts 
the bma has introduced prudential standards in relation to the ecr and capital and solvency return csr 
the ecr is determined using the bscr or an approved internal model  provided that at all times the ecr must be an amount equal to  or exceeding the minimum margin of solvency 
the csr is the return setting out the insurers risk management practises and other information used by the insurer to calculate its approved internal model ecr 
the new capital requirements require class insurers to hold available statutory capital and surplus equal to or exceeding ecr and set tcl at of ecr 
the bma also has a degree of discretion enabling it to impose ecr on insurers in particular cases  for instance where an insurer falls below the tcl 
in those cases  the new risk based capital model should be supplemented by a requirement for the affected insurers to conduct certain stress and scenario testing in order to assess their potential vulnerability to defined extreme events 
where the results of scenario and stress testing indicated potential capital vulnerability  the bma would be able to require a higher solvency cushion by increasing the tcl figure 
in circumstances where an insurer has failed to comply with an ecr given by the bma in respect of that insurer  such insurer is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends until the failure is rectified and the insurer is obliged to i provide the bma  within fourteen days of the failure  with a written report as to why the failure occurred and remedial steps to be taken  and ii within forty five days of the failure to provide the bma with unaudited interim financial statements 
in addition  the unaudited interim financial statements must be accompanied by the opinion of the loss reserve specialist  a general business solvency certificate in respect of the unaudited financials and a csr reflecting an ecr prepared using post failure data 
underlying the risk based solvency capital regime described above is the minimum solvency margin test set out in the insurance returns and solvency amendment regulations as amended 
while it must calculate its ecr annually by reference to either the bscr or an approved internal model  a class insurer such as endurance bermuda must also ensure that  at all times  its ecr is at least equal to the minimum solvency margin for a class insurer in respect of its general business  which is the greater of of net premiums written being gross premiums written less any reinsurance premiums ceded not exceeding of gross premiums written  and of net loss and loss expense provisions and other general business insurance reserves 
in addition  under the insurance act  class insurers are prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends of more than of its total statutory capital and surplus  as shown on its previous financial year statutory balance sheet  unless at least seven days before payment of the dividends it files with the bma an affidavit that it will continue to meet its required solvency margins 
endurance bermuda as a class insurer must obtain the bma s prior approval before reducing its total statutory capital  as shown on its previous financial year statutory balance sheet  by or more 
furthermore  under the companies act  endurance holdings and endurance bermuda may only declare or pay a dividend if endurance holdings or endurance bermuda  as the case may be  has no reasonable grounds for believing that it is  or would after the payment be  unable to pay its liabilities as they become due  or if the realizable value of its assets would not be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium accounts

group supervision emerging international norms in the regulation of global insurance and reinsurance groups are trending increasingly towards the imposition of group wide supervisory regimes by one principal home regulator over all the legal entities in the group  no matter where incorporated 
amendments to the insurance act in introduced such a regime into bermuda insurance regulation by the insertion of a new part iva of the insurance act

the notice has to be given within days of the shareholder becoming aware of the relevant facts 
these provisions are applicable to us and our shareholders although we are unlikely to ever trigger the shareholder controller provisions in respect of us shareholders due to the limitation on voting provisions in the endurance bermuda s bye laws 
also an insurer must give written notice to the bma that a person has become  or ceased to be  a controller of that insurer  a controller being a managing director  chief executive or other person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of endurance bermuda are accustomed to act  including any person who holds  or is entitled to exercise  or more of the voting shares or voting power or is able to exercise a significant influence over the management of endurance bermuda

uk regulation general on december   the financial services authority fsa assumed its full powers and responsibilities as the single statutory regulator responsible for regulating the financial services industry in respect of the carrying on of regulated activities including deposit taking  insurance  investment management and most other financial services business by way of business in the uk  with the purpose of maintaining confidence in the uk financial system  providing public understanding of the system  securing the proper degree of protection for consumers and helping to reduce financial crime 
it is a criminal offense for any person to carry on a regulated activity in the uk unless that person is authorized by the fsa and has been granted permission to carry on that regulated activity or falls under an exemption 
insurance business which includes reinsurance business is authorized and supervised by the fsa 
insurance business in the united kingdom is divided between two main categories long term insurance which is primarily investment related and general insurance 
it is not possible for an insurance company to be authorized in both long term and general insurance business 
these two categories are both divided into classes for example permanent health and pension fund management are two classes of long term insurance  damage to property and motor vehicle liability are two classes of general insurance 
under the financial services and markets act the fsma  effecting or carrying out contracts of insurance  within a class of general or long term insurance  by way of business in the united kingdom  constitutes a regulated activity requiring individual authorization 
an authorized insurance company must have permission for each class of insurance business it intends to write 

table of contents endurance uk has received authorization from the fsa to effect and carry out in the united kingdom contracts of insurance in all classes of general business limited in the case of credit and surety to reinsurance only except legal expenses and assistance business 
on january   as a result of the implementation by the united kingdom government of the insurance mediation directive ec various additional activities  which had previously been unregulated  fell within the scope of fsa regulation 
endurance uk has accordingly received authorization from the fsa to conduct the following additional regulated activities arranging bringing about deals in investments and making arrangements with a view to transactions in investments 
in both cases  those activities are restricted to non investment insurance contracts 
endurance uk is also authorized to accept deposits limited to accepting deposits in the course of carrying on insurance business for which it holds permission 
as an authorized insurer in the united kingdom  endurance uk would be able to operate throughout the eu  subject to certain regulatory requirements of the fsa and in some cases  certain local regulatory requirements 
an insurance company with fsa authorization to write insurance business in the united kingdom can seek consent from the fsa to allow it to provide cross border services in other member states of the eu as an alternative  fsa consent may be obtained to establish a branch office within another member state 
as an fsa authorized insurer  the insurance and reinsurance businesses of endurance uk are subject to close supervision by the fsa 
the fsa has implemented specific requirements for senior management arrangements  systems and controls of insurance and reinsurance companies under its jurisdiction  which place a strong emphasis on risk identification and management in relation to the prudential regulation of insurance and reinsurance business in the united kingdom 
in december  the fsa prompted a market initiative in the united kingdom insurance industry to resolve perceived problems resulting from contract uncertainty  which may exist where the full terms and conditions of a contract of insurance or reinsurance are not established at or before the time when the contract comes into force 
the fsa s stated preferred outcome was that a market solution should be produced which met the regulator s main concerns  which were that policyholders should know precisely what protection they have bought  and that insurers  reinsurers and brokers should have a clearer view  at the time of inception of a contract of the relevant legal  fiduciary  operational and underwriting risks to which they are subject 
contract certainty has since continued to be a supervisory priority and most of the insurance industry in the uk signed up to a code of practice to help avoid disputes arising from contract uncertainty 
the fsa has stated that in cases where it believes that firms have fallen behind the rest of the market in reducing the number of contracts that do not meet the market s contract certainty standards  it would consider regulatory action to address this  though no enforcement action has been taken in this regard to date 
this action might include increases in required regulatory capital or the commencement of enforcement action 
in december  the fsa published its new insurance conduct of business sourcebook icobs which sets out the standards of the requirements for general insurance firms on how they deal with their customers 
the new general insurance regime came into effect on january  supervision the fsa carries out the prudential supervision of insurance companies through a variety of methods  including the collection of information from statistical returns  review of accountants reports  visits to insurance companies and regular formal interviews 
the fsa has adopted a risk based approach to the supervision of insurance companies 
under this approach the fsa performs a formal risk assessment of insurance companies or groups carrying on business in the uk periodically  which varies in length according to the risk profile of the insurer 
the fsa performs the risk assessment by analyzing information which it receives during the normal course of its supervision  such as regular prudential returns on the financial position of the insurance company  or which it acquires through a series of meetings with senior management of the insurance company 
after each risk assessment  the fsa will inform the insurer of its views on the insurer s risk profile 
this will include details of any remedial action that the fsa requires and the likely consequences if this action is not taken 

table of contents solvency requirements the fsa s general prudential sourcebook and prudential sourcebook for insurers together  the prudential sourcebooks require that insurance companies maintain a margin of solvency at all times in respect of any general insurance undertaken by the insurance company  the calculation of which in any particular case depends on the type and amount of insurance business a company writes 
the method of calculation of the solvency margin is set out in the prudential sourcebooks  and for these purposes  all insurer s assets and liabilities are subject to specific valuation rules which are set out in the prudential sourcebooks 
failure to maintain the required solvency margin is one of the grounds on which wide powers of intervention conferred upon the fsa may be exercised 
for financial years ending on or after january   the calculation of the required margin of solvency has been amended as a result of the implementation of the eu solvency i directives 
in respect of liability business accepted  of the actual premiums written and claims incurred must be included in the calculation  which has had the effect of increasing the required minimum margin of solvency of endurance uk endurance uk continuously monitors its solvency capital position and maintains capital in excess of the required minimum margin of solvency 
each insurance company writing various classes of business is also required by the prudential sourcebooks to maintain equalization provisions calculated in accordance with the provisions of the prudential sourcebook for insurers 
insurers are required to calculate an enhanced capital requirement ecr in addition to their required minimum solvency margin and to report it to the fsa though the ecr is not part of the formal capital requirements under the prudential sourcebooks 
this represents a more risk based calculation than the statutory solvency margin requirements derived from the eu directives 
there is also a requirement for insurers to maintain financial resources which are adequate  both as to amount and quality  to ensure that there is no significant risk that its liabilities cannot be met as they come due 
in order to carry out the assessment as to the necessary financial resources that are required  an insurer is required to identify the major sources of risk to its ability to meet its liabilities as they come due  and to carry out stress and scenario tests to identify an appropriate range of realistic adverse scenarios in which the risk crystallizes and to estimate the financial resources needed in each of the circumstances and events identified 
in addition  the fsa gives individual capital guidance icg regularly to insurers and reinsurers following receipt of individual capital assessments  prepared by firms themselves 
the fsa s guidance may be that a company should hold more or less than its then current level of regulatory capital  or that the company s regulatory capital should remain unaltered 
endurance uk has submitted an individual capital assessment solvency calculation to the fsa and has agreed with the fsa the bases and methodology for this calculation 
this calculation is used along with other tools by the fsa to help establish the icg 
endurance uk is currently calculating the ecr for december  should endurance uk not meet this test  additional capital may be required 
in addition  an insurer other than a pure reinsurer that is part of a group  is required to perform and submit to the fsa a solvency margin calculation return in respect of its ultimate parent undertaking  in accordance with the fsa s rules 
this return is not part of an insurer s own solvency return and hence will not be publicly available 
although there is no requirement for the parent undertaking solvency calculation to show a positive result  the fsa may take action where it considers that the solvency of the insurance company is or may be jeopardized due to the group solvency position 
further  an insurer is required to report in its annual returns to the fsa all material related party transactions eg  intra group reinsurance  whose value is more than of the insurer s general insurance business amount 
the european commission  jointly with member states  is carrying out a fundamental review of the regulatory capital and supervisory regime of the insurance industry the solvency ii project 
its objective is to establish a solvency system that is better matched to the true risks of insurers enabling supervisors to protect policyholders interests as effectively as possible and in accordance with common principles across the eu 
endurance uk is monitoring the ongoing consultation and legislative steps following adoption of the solvency ii framework directive in may which will be amended by a further omnibus directive proposed by the european commission in january  together the solvency ii directive 
the legislation implementing the final version of the solvency ii directive is required to take effect in the uk and the other uk member states on january   and will replace the current solvency requirements described above 
the fsa is undertaking a program of preparatory work and supervisory visits to insurers  in order to identify the actions which it considers that insurers should now undertake in anticipation of the implementation of the solvency ii directive and to review insurers internal models for calculating all or part of the new solvency capital requirements 
endurance uk is fully co operating with the fsa in this respect 

table of contents restrictions on dividend payments uk company law prohibits endurance uk from declaring a dividend to its shareholders unless it has profits available for distribution 
the determination of whether a company has profits available for distribution is based on its accumulated realized profits less its accumulated realized losses 
while the united kingdom insurance regulatory laws impose no statutory restrictions on a general insurer s ability to declare a dividend  the fsa strictly controls the maintenance of each insurance company s solvency margin within its jurisdiction 
the fsa s rules require endurance uk to notify the fsa of any proposed or actual payment of a dividend 
any such payment or proposal could result in regulatory intervention 
in addition  the fsa requires authorized insurance companies to notify the fsa in advance of any significant dividend payment 
reporting requirements uk insurance companies must prepare their financial statements under the companies act of as amended  which requires the filing with companies house of audited financial statements and related reports 
in addition  uk insurance companies are required to file with the fsa regulatory returns  which include a revenue account  a profit and loss account and a balance sheet in prescribed forms 
under the interim prudential sourcebook for insurers  audited regulatory returns must be filed with the fsa within two months and days or three months where the delivery of the return is made electronically 
supervision of management the fsa closely supervises the management of insurance companies through the approved persons regime  by which any appointment of persons to perform certain specified controlled functions within a regulated entity  must be approved by the fsa 
change of control the financial services and markets act the fsma regulates the acquisition of control of any uk insurance company authorized under the fsma 
any company or individual that together with any person acting in concert with it or him directly or indirectly acquires or more of the shares in a uk authorized insurance company or its parent company  or is entitled to exercise or control the exercise of or more of the voting power in such authorized insurance company or its parent company  would be considered to have acquired control for the purposes of the relevant legislation  as would a person who had significant influence over the management of such authorized insurance company or its parent company by virtue of his shareholding or voting power in either 
a purchaser of or more of the ordinary shares would therefore be considered to have acquired control of endurance uk under the fsma as amended by the eu acquisitions directive  any person proposing to acquire control over a uk authorized insurance company must give prior notification to the fsa of his intention to do so together with certain prescribed information 
the fsa then has working days to make a decision following its acknowledgement of the application 
the duration of this period may be stopped by the fsa once  to request further information  for a maximum of days days for non eu applicants 
although the fsa may make further information requests  this does not stop the clock  meaning that the fsa has a maximum of working days to consider an application from an eu applicant for a non eu applicant 
the fsa may only object to a particular acquisition on the basis of certain specified assessment criteria relating to the reputation and financial soundness of the acquirer  the reputation and experience of those who will direct the regulated business  compliance with prudential requirement and any suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing 
in addition to these requirements  the uk insurer itself is obliged to notify the fsa if it is aware of the proposed acquisition  and may be subject to regulatory enforcement action if it fails to do so 
intervention and enforcement the fsa has extensive powers to intervene in the affairs of an authorized person  culminating in the ultimate sanction of the removal of authorization to carry on a regulated activity 
fsma imposes on the fsa statutory obligations to monitor compliance with the requirements imposed by fsma  and to enforce the provisions of fsma related rules made by the fsa 
the fsa has power  among other things  to enforce and take disciplinary measures in respect of breaches of both the prudential sourcebooks and breaches of the conduct of business rules generally applicable to authorized persons 
the fsa also has the power to prosecute criminal offences arising under fsma  and to prosecute insider dealing under part v of the criminal justice act of  and breaches of money laundering regulations 
the fsa s stated policy is to pursue criminal prosecution in all appropriate cases 

table of contents passporting european union directives allow endurance uk to conduct business in european union states other than the united kingdom in compliance with the scope of permission granted these companies by the fsa without the necessity of additional licensing or authorization in other european union jurisdictions 
this ability to operate in other jurisdictions of the european union on the basis of home state authorization and supervision is sometimes referred to as passporting 
insurers may operate outside their home member state either on a services basis or on an establishment basis 
operating on a services basis means that the company conducts permitted businesses in the host state without having a physical presence there  while operating on an establishment basis means the company has a branch or physical presence in the host state 
in both cases  a company remains subject to regulation by its home regulator  and not by local regulatory authorities  although the company nonetheless may have to comply with certain local rules reserved to the host state the state into which the services are being provided or in which the branch is being established 
in addition to european union member states  norway  iceland and liechtenstein members of the broader european economic area are jurisdictions in which this passporting framework applies 
elimination of the fsa the uk government is currently consulting on proposals to reform the uk regulatory structure 
this means that  as of  the fsa will cease to exist in its current form and three new regulatory bodies will be established in its place 
endurance uk will be supervised by both the financial conduct authority fca and the prudential regulation authority pra going forward 
the fca will be responsible for regulating the day to day conduct of insurance firms and the pra will have responsibility for monitoring compliance with prudential requirements 
it is proposed that the fca will have a more interventionalist approach to regulation and will be focused on consumer outcomes

if the insurance regulator in delaware and or texas adopts the revised model act and model regulation  the scope of insurance holding company regulation that the company s holding company system is currently subject to will be significantly expanded

prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer or reinsurer  the domiciliary state insurance commissioner will consider such factors as the financial strength of the proposed acquiror  the integrity and management of the acquiror s board of directors and executive officers  the acquiror s plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer and any anti competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control 
generally  state insurance statutes provide that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist if any person  directly or indirectly  owns  controls  holds with the power to vote  or holds proxies representing  ten percent or more of the voting securities of the domestic insurer 
because a person acquiring ten percent or more of endurance holdings ordinary shares would indirectly acquire the same percentage of common stock of endurance holdings us operating subsidiaries  the us insurance change of control laws will likely apply to such a transaction 
these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay  deter or prevent a change of control of endurance holdings  including through transactions  and in particular unsolicited transactions  that some or all of the shareholders of endurance holdings might consider to be desirable 
state insurance regulation of the company s us operating subsidiaries other than bulk reinsurance arrangements  the terms and conditions of reinsurance agreements between unaffiliated parties generally are not subject to regulation by any us state insurance department with respect to rates or policy terms unlike primary insurance agreements  the rates and policy terms of which are generally closely regulated by state insurance departments 
as a practical matter  however  the rates charged by primary insurers do have an effect on the rates that can be charged by reinsurers 
state insurance authorities have broad regulatory powers with respect to various aspects of the business of the company s us operating subsidiaries including licensing to transact business  admittance of assets to statutory surplus  regulating unfair trade and claims practices  establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards including risk based capital standards  approval of policy forms and dates  and regulating investments  dividends and transactions between an insurer and its affiliates 
with respect to direct insurance business  states may also regulate rates and forms used by insurers admitted to transact business within a given state jurisdiction 
state insurance laws and regulations require each of the company s us operating subsidiaries to file financial statements with insurance departments everywhere it is licensed  authorized or accredited to conduct insurance business  and the operations of the company s us operating subsidiaries are subject to examination by those departments at any time 
the company s us operating subsidiaries prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with statutory accounting practices and procedures prescribed or permitted by these departments 
state insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the books and records  financial reporting  policy filings and market conduct of insurance companies domiciled or authorized to transact business in their states  generally once every three to five years 
examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other states under guidelines promulgated by the naic 
in general  such state regulation is for the protection of policyholders rather than shareholders 
under delaware and texas insurance laws  the company s us operating subsidiaries may only pay dividends to their respective parent companies out of earned surplus 
in delaware and texas  earned surplus is defined as an amount equal to the unassigned funds of an insurer as set forth in the most recent annual statement of the insurer submitted to the applicable state insurance regulator  including all or part of the surplus arising from unrealized capital gains or revaluation of assets 

table of contents in addition  the ability of the company s us operating subsidiaries to declare or pay any dividend  together with all dividends declared or distributed by it within the preceding twelve months  exceeds the greater of ten percent of its policyholders surplus as of the st day of december of the preceding year  or the statutory net income  not including realized capital gains for the month period ending  for the preceding calendar year the st day of december next preceding will be subject to the prior approval of the applicable domestic state insurance regulator 
any dividend paid by any one of the company s us operating subsidiaries must first be paid to its parent company 
if the parent company is also an insurer  as is the case with endurance american  endurance american specialty and endurance risk solutions  the parent company or companies must also meet their own dividend eligibility requirements set forth above in order to pass along any dividends received from subsidiary insurance companies 
the dividend limitations imposed by delaware and texas insurance laws are based on the statutory financial results of the company s us operating subsidiaries determined by using statutory accounting practices which differ in certain respects from accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity with us gaap 
the significant differences relate to deferred acquisition expenses  deferred income taxes  required investment reserves  reserve calculation assumptions and surplus notes 
at december   of the company s us operating subsidiaries  only armtech had earned surplus  and therefore  only armtech could declare or distribute dividends in without prior regulatory approval 
the us federal government s oversight of the insurance industry was expanded under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer act the dodd frank act 
prior to the enactment of the dodd frank act in july  the us federal government s regulation of the insurance industry was essentially limited to certain insurance products  such as flood insurance  multi peril crop insurance and reinsurance of losses from terrorism 
as part of the overall federal financial regulatory reform package contained in the dodd frank act  congress has legislated reforms in the reinsurance and surplus lines sectors 
under reinsurance credit rules established under the dodd frank act  which are to become effective on july   a us ceding insurer need not satisfy the reinsurance credit rules of any nondomestic state if the following two conditions are met the ceding insurer s domestic state is naic accredited  and the ceding insurer s domestic state recognizes credit for reinsurance for its ceded risk 
the dodd frank act also created a federal insurance office fio in the us department of the treasury 
the fio will have the authority to gather information  to advise the treasury secretary on key issues such as terrorism risk coverage and insurance accounting rules  and to send reports to congress 
the fio director will serve as a nonvoting member of the financial stability oversight council 
in addition  the fio will have the ability to recommend to the financial stability oversight council the designation of an insurer as systemically significant and therefore subject to regulation by the federal reserve as a bank holding company 
in limited circumstances  the fio can declare a state insurance law or regulation preempted  but this can be done only after extensive consultation with state insurance regulators  the federal office of trade representative and key insurance industry players in trade associations representing insurers and intermediaries 
the dodd frank act has the potential to open the door to greater federal oversight of us insurance markets 
the us congress continues to examine the current condition of us state based insurance regulation to determine whether to allow optional federal insurance company incorporation 
the federal government has also undertaken initiatives in several other areas that may impact the insurance industry including tort reform  corporate governance and the taxation of insurance companies 
we cannot predict with certainty whether  or in what form  reforms will be enacted and  if so  whether the enacted reforms will positively or negatively affect our business or whether any effects will be material 
changes in federal statutes  including the gramm leach bliley act and the mccarran ferguson act  financial services regulation and federal taxation  in addition to changes to state statutes and regulations  may be more restrictive than current requirements or may result in higher costs  and could materially adversely affect the insurance industry and our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents risk based capital regulations the insurance laws of delaware and texas require that insurers report their risk based capital rbc based on a formula calculated by applying factors to various asset  premium and reserve items 
the formula takes into account the risk characteristics of the insurer  including asset risk  insurance risk  interest rate risk and business risk 
the state insurance departments of delaware and texas use the formula only as an early warning regulatory tool to identify possibly inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating regulatory action  and not as a means to rank insurers generally 
insurance laws impose broad confidentiality requirements on those engaged in the insurance business including insurers  agents  brokers and others and on the state insurance departments as to the use and publication of rbc data 
the insurance departments of delaware and texas have explicit regulatory authority to require various actions by  or take various actions against  insurers whose total adjusted capital does not exceed certain rbc levels 
statutory accounting practices statutory accounting practices  or sap  are a basis of accounting developed to assist us insurance regulators in monitoring and regulating the solvency of insurance companies 
it is primarily concerned with measuring an insurer s surplus to policyholders 
accordingly  statutory accounting focuses on valuing assets and liabilities of insurers at financial reporting dates in accordance with appropriate insurance law and regulatory provisions applicable in each insurer s domiciliary state 
us gaap concerns an insurer s solvency  but it also concerns other financial measurements  such as income and cash flows 
accordingly  us gaap gives more consideration to appropriate matching of revenue and expenses and accounting for management s stewardship of assets than does sap 
as a direct result  different assets and liabilities and different amounts of assets and liabilities will be reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap as opposed to sap 
statutory accounting practices established by the naic and adopted  in part  by the delaware and texas insurance regulators  determine  among other things  the amount of statutory surplus and statutory net income of endurance holdings us insurance company subsidiaries and thus determine  in part  the amount of funds they have available to pay dividends to their respective parent companies 
operations of endurance uk and endurance bermuda endurance uk and endurance bermuda are not admitted to do business in any state in the united states 
insurance laws of each state of the united states and of many other countries restrict or prohibit the sale of insurance and reinsurance within their jurisdictions by non admitted alien insurers and reinsurers such as endurance uk and endurance bermuda 
in addition to the regulatory requirements imposed by the jurisdictions in which they are licensed  reinsurers business operations are affected by regulatory requirements in various states of the united states governing credit for reinsurance which are imposed on their ceding companies 
in general  a ceding company that obtains reinsurance from a reinsurer that is licensed  accredited or approved by the jurisdiction or state in which the reinsurer files statutory financial statements is permitted to reflect in its statutory financial statements a credit in an aggregate amount equal to the liability for unearned premiums which are that portion of written premiums which applies to the remaining portion of the policy period and loss reserves and loss expense reserves ceded to the reinsurer 
as stated above  endurance uk and endurance bermuda are not licensed  accredited or approved in any state in the united states 
the great majority of states  however  permit a credit to statutory surplus resulting from reinsurance obtained from a non licensed or non accredited reinsurer to be offset to the extent that the reinsurer provides a letter of credit or other acceptable security arrangement 
a few states do not allow credit for reinsurance ceded to non licensed or non accredited reinsurers except in certain limited circumstances and others impose additional requirements that make it difficult to become accredited 
we do not believe that endurance uk and endurance bermuda are in violation of insurance laws of any jurisdiction in the united states 
there can be no assurance however  that inquiries or challenges to endurance uk s or endurance bermuda s insurance or reinsurance activities will not be raised in the future 
switzerland in  endurance bermuda established a branch in zurich  switzerland named endurance specialty insurance ltd 
pembroke bermuda zurich branch 
the swiss financial regulator does not impose additional regulation upon a swiss branch of a foreign reinsurer 
on january   the federal act on the swiss financial market supervisory authority finma  which the swiss parliament approved in june  went into full legal force 
the effect of the act was to merge three bodies the federal office of private insurance  the swiss federal banking commission and the anti money laundering control authority into finma 
until their merger and incorporation into finma  these three authorities retained responsibility for their own areas of activity

material tax considerations certain bermuda tax considerations currently  there is no bermuda income  corporation or profits tax  withholding tax  capital gains tax  capital transfer tax  estate duty or inheritance tax payable by us or our shareholders  other than shareholders ordinarily resident in bermuda  if any 
currently  there is no bermuda withholding or other tax on principal interest or dividends paid to holders of the ordinary shares or series a preferred shares  other than holders ordinarily resident in bermuda  if any 
there can be no assurance that we or our shareholders will not be subject to any such tax in the future 
endurance bermuda has received written assurance dated december  and endurance holdings has received written assurance dated july  from the minister of finance under the exempted undertakings tax protection act of bermuda  as amended  that if there is enacted in bermuda any legislation imposing tax computed on profits or income  or computed on any capital asset  gain or appreciation  or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax  then the imposition of that tax would not be applicable to endurance bermuda or endurance holdings or to any of their respective operations  shares  debentures or obligations until march   provided  that the assurance is subject to the condition that it will not be construed to prevent the application of such tax to people ordinarily resident in bermuda  or to prevent the application of any taxes payable by endurance bermuda or endurance holdings in respect of real property or leasehold interests in bermuda held by them 
to date  the ministry of finance has given no indication that the ministry i would not extend the term of the assurance beyond  or ii would allow the term of the assurance to expire  or iii would change the tax treatment afforded to exempted companies either before or after the government of bermuda has announced its intent to extend the protection afforded under the exempted undertakings tax protection act to however  the extension has not yet been enacted into law and there can be no assurance that it will be enacted into law 
accordingly  it is possible that after march  we may be subject to bermuda taxes 
certain united kingdom tax considerations endurance uk is a company incorporated under the laws of england and is resident in the united kingdom for united kingdom corporation tax purposes and will be subject to united kingdom corporation tax on its worldwide profits 
the current rate of united kingdom corporation tax is generally on profits of whatever description 
currently  no united kingdom withholding tax applies to dividends paid by endurance uk certain united states federal income tax considerations the following discussion is a summary of certain us federal income tax considerations relating to endurance holdings and its operating subsidiaries in bermuda  the united states and the united kingdom and the ownership of our ordinary shares and series a preferred shares 

table of contents this summary is based upon the code  the regulations promulgated thereunder  rulings and other administrative pronouncements issued by the irs  judicial decisions  the tax treaty between the united states and bermuda the bermuda treaty and the tax treaty between the united states and the united kingdom the uk treaty  all as currently in effect  and all of which are subject to differing interpretations or to change  possibly with retroactive effect 
no assurance can be given that the irs would assert  or that a court would not sustain a position contrary to any of the tax consequences described below 
no advance ruling has been or will be sought from the irs regarding any matter discussed in this annual report on form k 
this summary is for general information only  and does not purport to discuss all aspects of us federal income taxation that may be important to a particular investor in light of such investor s investment or tax circumstances  or to investors subject to special tax rules  such as tax exempt organizations  dealers in securities  banks  insurance companies  persons that hold ordinary shares or series a preferred shares that are a hedge or that are hedged against interest rate or insurance risks or that are part of a straddle or conversion transaction  or persons whose functional currency is not the us dollar 
this summary assumes that an investor will hold our ordinary shares and series a preferred shares as capital assets  which generally means as property held for investment 
investors should consult their tax advisors concerning the consequences  in their particular circumstances  of the ownership of ordinary shares and series a preferred shares under us federal  state  local and other tax laws 
for us federal income tax purposes and for purposes of the following discussion  a us person means i an individual citizen or resident of the united states  ii a corporation  or other entity treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes  or a partnership  or other entity treated as a partnership for u 
s federal income tax purposes  in each case created or organized in the united states or under the laws of the united states or of any of its political subdivisions  iii an estate the income of which is subject to us federal income tax without regard to its source or iv a trust if either a a court within the united states is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more us persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or b the trust has a valid election in effect to be treated as a us person for us federal income tax purposes 
a us person is a nonresident alien individual  or a corporation  estate or trust that is not a us person 
if a partnership owns ordinary shares or series a preferred shares  the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership 
if you are a partner of a partnership that owns ordinary shares or series a preferred shares  you should consult your tax advisor 
united states taxation of endurance holdings and its operating subsidiaries our intent has been and continues to be to operate endurance holdings and its non us subsidiaries in such a manner that they will not be considered to be conducting business within the united states for purposes of us federal income taxation 
whether business is being conducted in the united states is an inherently factual determination 
because the code  regulations and court decisions fail to identify definitively activities that constitute being engaged in a trade or business in the united states  there can be no assurance that the irs will not contend successfully that endurance holdings  endurance bermuda and or endurance uk are or will be engaged in a trade or business in the united states 
a foreign corporation deemed to be so engaged would be subject to us federal income tax at a current maximum rate of  as well as a branch profits tax in certain circumstances  on its income which is treated as effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business unless the corporation is entitled to relief under the permanent establishment provision of an applicable tax treaty  as discussed below 
such income tax  if imposed  would be based on effectively connected income computed in a manner generally analogous to that applied to the income of a us corporation  except that a foreign corporation is entitled to deductions and credits only if it timely files a us federal income tax return 
endurance holdings  endurance bermuda and endurance uk have in the past and intend to continue to file protective us federal income tax returns on a timely basis in order to preserve the right to claim income tax deductions and credits if it is ever determined that they are subject to us federal income tax 
so long as endurance bermuda is entitled to the benefits under the bermuda us tax convention  it will not be subject to bermuda us federal income tax on any income found to be effectively connected with a us trade or business unless that trade or business is conducted through a permanent establishment in the united states 
whether business is being conducted in the united states through a permanent establishment is an inherently factual determination 
endurance bermuda intends to conduct its activities so as not to have a permanent establishment in the united states  although there can be no assurance that it will achieve this result 
an insurance enterprise resident in bermuda generally will be entitled to the benefits of the bermuda us tax convention if i more than of its shares are owned beneficially  directly or indirectly  by individual residents of the united states or bermuda or us citizens and ii its income is not used in substantial part  directly or indirectly  to make disproportionate distributions to  or to meet certain liabilities of  persons who are neither residents of either the united states or bermuda nor us citizens 

table of contents foreign insurance companies that conduct an insurance business within the united states must maintain a certain minimum amount of effectively connected net investment income  determined in accordance with a formula that depends  in part  on the amount of us risk insured or reinsured by such companies 
if endurance bermuda is considered to be engaged in the conduct of an insurance business in the united states and it is not entitled to the benefits of the bermuda us tax convention  either because it fails to satisfy one of the limitations on bermuda us tax convention benefits described above or because endurance bermuda is considered to have a us permanent establishment  a significant portion of endurance bermuda s premium and investment income could be subject to us federal income tax 
in addition  while the bermuda us tax convention clearly applies to premium income  it is not clear whether it applies to other income  such as investment income 
consequently  if endurance bermuda is considered to be engaged in the conduct of an insurance business in the united states and is entitled to the benefits of the bermuda us tax convention  but the bermuda us tax convention is interpreted so as not to apply to investment income  a significant portion of endurance bermuda s investment income could be subject to us federal income tax even if endurance bermuda does not maintain a permanent establishment in the united states 
under the uk treaty  endurance uk  if entitled to the benefits of the uk treaty  will not be subject to uk federal income tax on any income found to be effectively connected with a us trade or business unless that trade or business is conducted through a permanent establishment in the united states 
endurance uk intends to continue to conduct its activities in a manner so that it does not have a permanent establishment in the united states  although we cannot predict whether we will achieve this result 
endurance uk will be entitled to the benefits of the uk treaty if i during at least half of the days in the relevant taxable period  at least of endurance uk s stock is beneficially owned  directly or indirectly  by citizens or residents of the united states and the united kingdom  and less than of endurance uk s gross income for the relevant taxable period is paid or accrued  directly or indirectly  to persons who are not us or uk residents in the form of payments that are deductible for purposes of uk taxation or ii with respect to specific items of income  profit or gain derived from the united states  if such income  profit or gain is considered to be derived in connection with  or incidental to  endurance uk s business conducted in the united kingdom 
foreign corporations not engaged in a trade or business in the united states are nonetheless subject to us withholding tax at a rate of of the gross amount of certain fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains  profits and income derived from sources within the united states such as dividends and certain interest on investments  subject to reduction by applicable treaties 
the united states also imposes an excise tax on insurance and reinsurance premiums paid to foreign insurers or reinsurers with respect to risks located in the united states 
the rate of tax applicable to premiums paid to endurance bermuda is for non life insurance premiums and for reinsurance premiums 
the excise tax will not apply to premiums paid to endurance uk if endurance uk is entitled to the benefits of the uk treaty  and certain other requirements are met 
endurance us reinsurance  endurance american  endurance american specialty and endurance risk solutions are delaware corporations and armtech is a texas corporation 
each will be subject to taxation in the united states at regular corporate rates 
dividends paid by endurance us holdings corp 
to endurance bermuda will be subject to us withholding tax at the rate of 
united states taxation of holders of ordinary shares and series a preferred shares shareholders who are us persons dividends 
distributions with respect to ordinary shares and series a preferred shares including the payment of additional amounts  in the case of the series a preferred shares will be treated as ordinary dividend income to the extent of endurance holdings current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined for us federal income tax purposes  subject to the discussion below relating to the potential application of the controlled foreign corporation  related person insurance income and passive foreign investment company rules 
these dividends should constitute qualified dividend income as defined in section h b of the code and  thus  should be entitled to the maximum marginal preferential federal income tax rate of applicable to qualified dividends received before january  by certain shareholders such as individuals  provided that certain holding period requirements are satisfied and certain other conditions are met  and provided further that we are not considered a pfic 
this preferential tax rate is subject to increase for dividends paid after such date 

table of contents distributions with respect to endurance holdings ordinary shares and series a preferred shares will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to us corporations under the code 
the amount of any distribution that exceeds endurance holdings current and accumulated earnings and profits first will be treated as a tax free return of capital  reducing a holder s tax basis in the ordinary shares or series a preferred shares with regard to which the distribution was made and any amount in excess of such tax basis will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of such holder s shares 
classification of endurance holdings  endurance uk or endurance bermuda as a controlled foreign corporation 
each us shareholder of a foreign corporation that is a controlled foreign corporation cfc for an uninterrupted period of days or more during a taxable year  and who owns shares in the cfc directly or indirectly through foreign entities  in such corporation on the last day  in such year  in which such corporation is a cfc must include in its gross income for us federal income tax purposes its pro rata share of the cfc s subpart f income  even if the subpart f income is not distributed 
a foreign corporation is considered a cfc if us shareholders own directly  indirectly through foreign entities or constructively pursuant to the application of certain constructive ownership rules more than of the total combined voting power of all classes of voting stock of such foreign corporation  or the total value of all stock of such corporation 
a us shareholder is a us person who owns at least of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of the foreign corporation 
the series a preferred shares should not be considered voting stock for purposes of determining whether a us person would be a us shareholder unless and until there exists a nonpayment event which triggers the series a preferred shareholders right to elect two additional directors to the board of directors of endurance holdings 
in such case  the series a preferred shares should be treated as voting stock for as long as such right continues 
for purposes of taking into account insurance income  a cfc also includes a foreign corporation in which more than of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock or more than of the total value of the stock is owned directly  indirectly through foreign entities or constructively pursuant to the application of certain constructive ownership rules by us shareholders  on any day during the taxable year of such corporation  if the gross amount of premiums or other consideration for the reinsurance or the issuing of insurance contracts exceeds of the gross amount of all premiums or other consideration in respect of all risks 
due to the anticipated dispersion of endurance holdings share ownership among holders  its bye law provisions that impose limitations on the concentration of voting power of any shares that are entitled to vote and authorize the board to repurchase such shares under certain circumstances and other factors  no us person that owns shares in endurance holdings directly or indirectly through foreign entities should be subject to treatment as a us shareholder of a cfc 
there can be no assurance  however  that the irs will not challenge the effectiveness of these provisions for purposes of preventing us shareholder status and that a court will not sustain such challenge 
rpii companies 
the cfc rules also apply to certain insurance companies that earn related person insurance income 
rpii 
if the rpii rules were to apply to endurance uk or endurance bermuda  a uk person who owns ordinary shares or series a preferred shares of endurance holdings  directly or indirectly through foreign entities on the last day of the company s taxable year would be required to include in its gross income for us federal income tax purposes its pro rata share of endurance uk s or endurance bermuda s rpii for the entire taxable year  regardless of whether such rpii is distributed 
for purposes of the rpii rules  endurance uk or endurance bermuda will be treated as a cfc if rpii shareholders collectively own directly  indirectly through foreign entities or by application of the constructive ownership rules or more of the stock of endurance uk or endurance bermuda by vote or value 
rpii is defined as any insurance income attributable to policies of insurance or reinsurance with respect to which the person directly or indirectly insured is a rpii shareholder of the foreign corporation or a related person to such rpii shareholder 
in general  and subject to certain limitations  insurance income is income including premium and investment income attributable to the issuing of any insurance or reinsurance contract which would be taxed under the portions of the code relating to insurance companies if the income were the income of a domestic insurance company 
a rpii shareholder is any us person who owns  directly or indirectly through foreign entities  any amount rather than stock possessing or more of the total combined voting power of endurance uk s or endurance bermuda s stock  and related person means someone who controls or is controlled by the rpii shareholder or someone who is controlled by the same person or persons which control the rpii shareholder 
control is measured by either more than in value or more than in voting power of stock  applying constructive ownership principles 
a corporation s pension plan is ordinarily not a related person with respect to the corporation unless the pension plan owns  directly or indirectly through the application of constructive ownership rules  more than  measured by vote or value  of the stock of the corporation 

table of contents rpii exceptions 
the special rpii rules do not apply if i direct or indirect insureds and persons related to such insureds  whether or not us persons  own  directly or indirectly  less than of the voting power and less than of the value of the stock of endurance uk or endurance bermuda  as applicable the ownership exception  ii rpii  determined on a gross basis  is less than of endurance uk s or endurance bermuda s gross insurance income for the taxable year  as applicable the gross income exception  iii endurance uk or endurance bermuda elects to be taxed on its rpii as if the rpii were effectively connected with the conduct of a us trade or business and to waive all treaty benefits with respect to rpii and meets certain other requirements or iv endurance uk or endurance bermuda elects to be treated as a us corporation 
endurance bermuda and endurance uk intend to operate in a manner that is intended to ensure that each qualifies for the gross income exception 
it is possible that neither endurance bermuda nor endurance uk will be successful in qualifying under this exception 
if none of these exceptions applies  each us person who owns shares in endurance holdings and therefore  indirectly in endurance uk and endurance bermuda on the last day of endurance holdings taxable year  will be required to include in its gross income for us federal income tax purposes its share of rpii of endurance uk and or endurance bermuda for the entire taxable year 
this inclusion will be determined as if such rpii were distributed proportionately only to such us persons holding shares in endurance holdings at that date 
the inclusion will be limited to the current year earnings and profits of endurance uk or endurance bermuda  as applicable  reduced by the shareholder s pro rata share  if any  of certain prior year deficits in earnings and profits 
basis adjustments 
a rpii shareholder s tax basis in its endurance holdings ordinary shares or series a preferred shares  as the case may be  will be increased by the amount of any rpii or other subpart f income that the shareholder includes in income 
any distributions made by endurance holdings out of previously taxed rpii or other subpart f income will be exempt from further tax in the hands of the rpii shareholder 
the rpii shareholder s tax basis in its endurance holdings shares will be reduced by the amount of any distributions that are excluded from income under this rule 
uncertainty as to application of rpii 
regulations interpreting the rpii provisions of the code exist only in proposed form 
it is not certain whether these regulations will be adopted in their proposed form or what changes might ultimately be made or whether any such changes  as well as any interpretation or application of the rpii rules by the irs  the courts or otherwise  might have retroactive effect 
accordingly  the meaning of the rpii provisions and their application to endurance uk and endurance bermuda is uncertain 
these provisions include the grant of authority to the us treasury to prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this subsection  including regulations preventing the avoidance of this subsection through cross insurance arrangements or otherwise 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge any determinations by endurance uk or endurance bermuda as to the amount  if any  of rpii that should be includible in income or that the amounts of the rpii inclusions will not be subject to adjustment based upon subsequent irs examination 
prospective investors should consult their tax advisors as to the effects of these uncertainties 
information reporting 
under certain circumstances  us persons owning stock in a foreign corporation are required to file irs form with their us federal income tax returns 
generally  information reporting on irs form is required with respect to i a person who is treated as a rpii shareholder  ii a us shareholder of a foreign corporation that is a cfc for an uninterrupted period of days or more during any tax year of the foreign corporation  and who owned the stock on the last of that year and iii under certain circumstances  a us person who acquires stock in a foreign corporation  and as a result thereof owns or more of the voting power or value of such foreign corporation  whether or not such foreign corporation is a cfc 
for any taxable year in which endurance holdings determines that gross rpii constitutes or more of endurance uk s or endurance bermuda s gross insurance income and the ownership exception does not apply  endurance holdings intends to mail to all us persons registered as holders of its ordinary shares and series a preferred shares irs form  completed with information from endurance holdings  for attachment to the us federal income tax returns of such shareholders 
a tax exempt organization that is treated as a us shareholder or a rpii shareholder also must file irs form in the circumstances described above 
failure to file irs form may result in penalties 
tax exempt shareholders 
tax exempt entities will be required to treat certain subpart f insurance income  including rpii that is includible in income by the tax exempt entity as unrelated business taxable income 

table of contents dispositions of ordinary shares and series a preferred shares 
subject to the discussion below relating to the redemption of series a preferred shares or the potential application of code section or the pfic rules  any gain or loss realized by a us person on the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares or series a preferred shares will be subject to us federal income taxation as capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized upon such sale or exchange and such person s tax basis in the shares 
if the holding period for these shares exceeds one year at the time of the disposition  any gain will be subject to tax at a current maximum marginal tax rate of for individuals subject to increase in without any congressional action and for corporations 
moreover  gain  if any  generally will be us source gain and generally will constitute passive income for foreign tax credit limitation purposes 
code section provides that if a us person sells or exchanges stock in a foreign corporation and such person owned directly  indirectly through certain foreign entities or constructively or more of the voting power of the corporation at any time during the five year period ending on the date of disposition when the corporation was a cfc  any gain from the sale or exchange of the shares will be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the cfc s earnings and profits determined under us federal income tax principles during the period that the shareholder held the shares and while the corporation was a cfc with certain adjustments 
a us shareholder may in certain circumstances be required to report a disposition of shares of a cfc by attaching irs form to the us federal income tax or information return that it would normally file for the taxable year in which the disposition occurs 
for these purposes  the series a preferred shares should not be considered as having voting power unless and until there exists a nonpayment event which triggers the series a preferred shareholders right to elect two additional directors to the board of directors of endurance holdings 
in such case  the series a preferred shares should be treated as voting stock for as long as such right continues 
code section also applies to the sale or exchange of shares in a foreign corporation if the foreign corporation would be treated as a cfc for rpii purposes and would be taxed as an insurance company if it were a domestic corporation  regardless of whether the shareholder is a us shareholder or whether the gross income exception or the ownership exception applies 
regulations do not specifically address whether or how code section would apply to dispositions of shares of stock in a foreign corporation that is not a cfc and does not directly engage in the insurance business  but has a subsidiary that is a cfc and that would be taxed as an insurance company if it were a domestic corporation 
the company believes  however  that the application of code section under the rpii rules should not apply to the disposition of ordinary shares or series a preferred shares because endurance holdings is not directly engaged in the insurance business 
there can be no assurance  however  that the irs will not interpret the regulations in a contrary manner or that the us treasury department will not amend the regulations to provide that these rules will apply to dispositions of our ordinary shares and series a preferred shares 
prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the effects of these rules on a disposition of our shares 
redemption of series a preferred shares 
subject to the discussion herein relating to the application of the rpii and pfic rules  under section of the code  a redemption of the series a preferred shares will be treated as a dividend to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits  unless such redemption satisfies the tests set forth under section b of the code  which would treat the redemption as a sale or exchange subject to taxation as described above under dispositions of ordinary shares and series a preferred shares 
a redemption will be treated as a sale or exchange if i it is substantially disproportionate  ii constitutes a complete termination of the holder s stock interest in us  or iii is not essentially equivalent to a dividend  each within the meaning of section b of the code 
in determining whether any of these tests are satisfied  shares considered to be owned by a us person by reason of certain constructive ownership rules set forth in the code  as well as shares actually owned  must generally be taken into account 
because the determination as to whether any of the alternative tests of section b of the code is satisfied with respect to a particular holder of the series a preferred shares will depend on the facts and circumstances as of the time the determination is made  us shareholders should consult their tax advisors  at such time  to determine their tax treatment in light of their particular circumstances 
passive foreign investment companies 
in general  a foreign corporation will be a pfic during a given year if i or more of its gross income constitutes passive income or ii or more of its assets produce passive income 

table of contents if endurance holdings were characterized as a pfic during a given year  us persons owning ordinary shares or series a preferred shares would be subject to a penalty tax at the time of the sale at a gain of  or receipt of an excess distribution with respect to  their shares  unless such shareholders made a qualified electing fund election or mark to market election 
it is uncertain that endurance holdings would be able to provide its shareholders with the information necessary for a us person to make the elections 
in general  a shareholder receives an excess distribution if the amount of the distribution is more than of the average distribution with respect to the shares during the three preceding taxable years or shorter period during which the taxpayer held the shares 
in general  the penalty tax is equivalent to an interest charge on taxes that are deemed due during the period the shareholder owned the shares  computed by assuming that the excess distribution or gain in the case of a sale with respect to the shares was taxed in equal portions at the highest applicable tax rate on ordinary income throughout the shareholder s period of ownership 
the interest charge is equal to the applicable rate imposed on underpayments of us federal income tax for such period 
for the above purposes  passive income generally includes interest  dividends  annuities and other investment income 
the pfic statutory provisions  however  contain an express exception for income derived in the active conduct of an insurance business by a corporation which is predominantly engaged in an insurance business 
this exception is intended to ensure that income derived by a bona fide insurance company is not treated as passive income  except to the extent such income is attributable to financial reserves in excess of the reasonable needs of the insurance business 
endurance holdings expects for purposes of the pfic rules that each of endurance uk and endurance bermuda will be predominantly engaged in an insurance business and is unlikely to have financial reserves in excess of the reasonable needs of its insurance business 
accordingly  neither expects to be treated as a pfic for us federal income tax purposes 
there can be no assurances  however  that this will be the case 
the pfic statutory provisions contain a look through rule stating that  for purposes of determining whether a foreign corporation is a pfic  such foreign corporation shall be treated as if it received directly its proportionate share of the income and as if it held its proportionate share of the assets of any other corporation in which it owns at least by value of the shares 
while no explicit guidance is provided by the statutory language  under this look through rule endurance holdings should be deemed to own the assets and to have received the income of its insurance subsidiaries directly for purposes of determining whether it qualifies for the insurance exception 
consequently  endurance holdings does not expect to be treated as a pfic for us federal income tax purposes 
this interpretation of the look through rule is consistent with the legislative intention generally to exclude bona fide insurance companies from the application of pfic provision 
nevertheless  there are currently no treasury regulations regarding the application of the pfic provisions to an insurance company  and new treasury regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying these rules may be forthcoming 
in addition  the determination of pfic status is fundamentally factual in nature  depends on the application of complex us federal income tax rules that are subject to differing interpretations  and generally cannot be determined until the close of the taxable year in question 
therefore  there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge this position or that a court will not sustain such challenge 
prospective investors should consult their tax advisor as to the effects of the pfic rules

endurance risk solutions  domiciled in delaware  and american agri business insurance company  managed by armtech insurance services  inc collectively armtech  both domiciled in texas 
endurance holdings and its wholly owned subsidiaries are collectively referred to in this discussion and analysis as the company 
the company writes specialty lines of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance on a global basis and seeks to create a portfolio of specialty lines of business that are profitable and have limited correlation with one another 
the company s portfolio of specialty lines of business is organized into two business segments  insurance and reinsurance 

table of contents in the insurance segment  the company writes agriculture  professional lines  casualty  property  healthcare liability  and workers compensation insurance 
in the reinsurance segment  the company writes catastrophe  casualty  property  aerospace and marine  and surety and other specialty reinsurance 
the company s insurance and reinsurance segments both include property related coverages  which provide insurance or reinsurance of an insurable interest in tangible property for property loss  damage or loss of use 
in addition  the company s insurance and reinsurance segments include various casualty insurance and reinsurance coverages  which are primarily concerned with the losses caused by injuries to third parties  ie  not the insured  or to property owned by third parties and the legal liability imposed on the insured resulting from such injuries 
business and accounting factors the company s results of operations are affected by the following business and accounting factors revenues 
the company derives its revenues primarily from premiums from its insurance policies and reinsurance contracts 
the premiums the company charges for the risks assumed are priced based on many assumptions and are a function of the amount and type of policies and contracts the company writes as well as prevailing market prices  and in the case of agricultural insurance contracts  federally mandated pricing 
the company prices these risks before its ultimate costs are known  which may extend many years into the future 
the company s revenues also include income generated from its investment portfolio 
the company s investment portfolio is comprised of fixed maturity investments  short term investments and preferred equity securities that are held as available for sale and other investments  comprised of alternative funds and high yield loan funds that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap  the available for sale investments are carried at fair market value and unrealized gains and losses on the company s investments are generally excluded from earnings 
these unrealized gains and losses are included on the company s balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders equity 
if unrealized losses are considered to be other than temporarily impaired due to credit related factors  such losses are included in earnings as net impairment losses recognized in earnings 
for other investments  the company increases or decreases the value of these investments for the company s share of income or loss  less dividends  which is included in net investment income 
expenses 
the company s expenses consist primarily of losses and loss expenses  acquisition expenses  interest expense  amortization of intangible assets and general and administrative expenses 
losses and loss expenses are estimated by management and reflect its best estimate of ultimate losses and loss adjustment costs arising during the current reporting period and revisions of prior period estimates 
the company records losses and loss expenses based on an actuarial analysis of the estimated losses the company expects to be reported on policies and contracts written 
the ultimate losses and loss expenses will depend on the actual costs to settle claims 
acquisition expenses consist principally of commissions and brokerage expenses that are typically a percentage of the premiums on insurance policies or reinsurance contracts written 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses and general operating expenses 
marketplace conditions and trends 
in general  at the end of  we believe operating conditions continued to be competitive 
in most classes of property and casualty business  we experienced downward pricing driven largely by relatively high levels of underwriting capacity and competition 
in our agriculture business  pricing was stable  although the underlying exposure base decreased with the decline in commodity prices 
we continued to maintain our adherence to underwriting standards by declining business when pricing  terms and conditions did not meet our underwriting criteria 

table of contents in  we believe the following four primary influences may affect the market for our insurance and reinsurance products the continuation of the challenging global economy  increased pricing competition in many of our markets  increased volatility in agriculture commodity prices and a low interest rate environment 
the united states and other markets around the world have continued to experience unsettled economic conditions  including high levels of unemployment  significant governmental regulation initiatives and continued uncertainty in global financial markets 
although economies are slowly recovering  the lower levels of economic activity are likely to continue to suppress growth in demand for insurance and reinsurance 
this  combined with the continued increase in recovery of most of the industry s surplus position in  is likely to result in a more competitive global insurance and reinsurance market in potentially offsetting these factors is the increased volatility of agriculture commodity prices which could lead to increased risk exposure and higher demand in our agriculture insurance business 
in addition  the current low interest rate environment will likely encourage a lower appetite for risks that are not adequately priced as there will be reduced investment earnings from underwriting cash flows 
we believe these four factors have and will continue to contribute to changes in market conditions within both the reinsurance and insurance market places in which we operate 
at this time  the company cannot predict with any reasonable certainty whether and to what extent current marketplace conditions and trends will persist in the future 
critical accounting estimates the company s consolidated financial statements contain certain amounts that are inherently subjective in nature and require management to make assumptions and best estimates to determine the reported values and related disclosures 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
if factors such as those described in the risk factors section in this annual report on form k cause actual events or results to differ materially from management s underlying assumptions or estimates  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies affect significant estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
premiums 
the company s insurance premiums are earned pro rata over the terms of the applicable risk period specified in the insurance policy 
the company s insurance policies are written on a losses occurring or claims made basis during the term of the policy 
generally  the company receives a fixed premium which is identified in the policy and is recorded on the inception date of the contract or when premiums are determinable and earned evenly over the policy term 
this premium will only adjust if the underlying insured basis adjusts 
accordingly  we monitor the underlying insured basis and record additional or return premiums in the period in which amounts are reasonably determinable 
insurance premiums written accounted for   and of the company s gross premiums written during the years ended december    and  respectively 
the company s reinsurance premiums are earned in proportion to the amount of reinsurance protection provided over the terms of the applicable risk period established in the reinsurance contract 
reinsurance contracts written on a losses occurring basis cover losses which occur during the term of the reinsurance contract  typically months 
accordingly  the company earns the premium on a losses occurring reinsurance contract evenly over the reinsurance contract term 
losses occurring reinsurance contracts accounted for approximately   and of the company s gross premiums written during the years ended december    and  respectively 
reinsurance contracts written on a policies attaching basis cover losses from the underlying insurance policies incepting during the terms of the reinsurance contracts 
losses under a policies attaching reinsurance contract may occur after the end date of the reinsurance contract  so long as they are losses from policies which began during the reinsurance contract period 
the company typically earns the premiums for policies attaching reinsurance contracts over a month period in proportion to the amount of reinsurance protection provided to reflect the extension of the risk period past the term of the contract and the varying levels of reinsurance protection provided during the reinsurance contract period 
policies attaching reinsurance contracts accounted for approximately   and of the company s gross premiums written during the years ended december    and  respectively 

table of contents in addition to determining the applicable risk period  the company s estimate of its reinsurance premiums written is based on the type of reinsurance contracts underwritten 
for excess of loss reinsurance contracts  the deposit premium  as defined in the contract  is generally considered to be the best estimate of the reinsurance contract s written premium at inception 
the company earns reinstatement premiums upon the occurrence of a loss under the reinsurance contract 
reinstatement premiums are calculated in accordance with the contract terms based upon the ultimate loss estimate associated with each contract 
excess of loss reinsurance contracts accounted for approximately   and of the company s gross premiums written during the years ended december    and  respectively 
for proportional reinsurance contracts  the company estimates premiums  commissions and related expenses based on broker and ceding company estimates 
in addition to ceding company estimates  the company also utilizes its judgment in establishing proportional reinsurance contract premium estimates after considering the following factors the ceding company s historical premium versus projected premium  the ceding company s history of providing accurate estimates  anticipated changes in the marketplace and the ceding company s competitive position therein  reported premiums to date  and correspondence and communication between the company and its brokers  intermediaries and ceding companies 
proportional reinsurance contracts accounted for approximately   and of the company s gross premiums written during the years ended december    and  respectively 
premiums on the company s excess of loss and proportional reinsurance contracts are estimated by management at the time the business is underwritten 
accordingly  this is the amount the company records as written premium in the period the contracts incept 
as actual premiums are reported by the ceding companies  management evaluates the appropriateness of the original premium estimates and any adjustment to these estimates is recorded in the period in which it becomes known 
the company has not historically experienced material adjustments to its initial premium estimates for its excess of loss reinsurance contracts 
for proportional contracts  as is customary in the reinsurance market  there is a time lag from the point when premium and related commission and expense activity is recorded by a ceding company to the point when such information is reported by the ceding company to the company  either directly or through a reinsurance intermediary 
this time lag can vary from one to several months or calendar quarters 
in addition  uncertainty in premium estimates arises due to changes in renewal rates or rate of new business acceptances by the cedant insurance companies and changes in the rates being charged by cedants 
changes to original premium estimates for proportional contracts could be material and such adjustments may directly and significantly impact earnings in the period they are determined because the subject premium may be fully or substantially earned 
the company s limited historical experience has shown that estimated premiums from proportional contracts have varied and have been adjusted by up to approximately  although larger variations  both positive and negative  are possible as a result of changes in one or more of the premium assumptions as noted above 
a variation in the company s proportional premiums receivable  net as of december   after considering the related expected losses and loss expenses  acquisition expenses and taxes  would result in an impact of approximately million on the company s net income 
the following summarizes the company s net proportional premium estimates within premiums receivable  net on the company s audited consolidated balance sheet as of december  and surety and aerospace other classes of coverages casualty property and marine specialty total us dollars in thousands as of december  proportional premiums receivable  net as of december  proportional premiums receivable  net as a result of recognizing the estimated gross premium written at the inception of the policy and collecting that premium over an extended period  we include a premiums receivable asset on our balance sheet 
we actively monitor our premiums receivable asset to consider whether we need an allowance for doubtful accounts 
as part of this process  we consider the credit quality of our cedants and monitor premium receipts versus expectations 
at december   the company has an allowance for estimated uncollectible premiums receivable of million million 

table of contents reserve for losses and loss expenses 
the company s reserve for losses and loss expenses includes case reserves and reserves for losses incurred but not reported referred to as ibnr reserves 
case reserves are established for losses that have been reported to us  but not yet paid 
ibnr reserves represent the estimated ultimate cost of events or conditions that have not been reported to or specifically identified by the company  but have occurred 
case reserves and ibnr reserves are established by management based on reports from reinsurance intermediaries  ceding companies and insureds and consultations with independent legal counsel 
in addition  ibnr reserves are established by management based on reported losses and loss expenses and actuarially determined estimates of ultimate losses and loss expenses 
under us gaap  the company is not permitted to establish loss reserves until the occurrence of an actual loss event 
once such an event occurs  the company establishes reserves based upon estimates of total losses incurred by the ceding companies or insureds as a result of the event  its estimate of the potential losses incurred  and its estimate of the portion of such loss the company has insured or reinsured 
as a result  only loss reserves applicable to losses incurred up to the financial statement date may be recorded  with no allowance for the provision of a contingency reserve to account for expected future losses 
losses arising from future events will be estimated and recognized at the time the loss is incurred and could be substantial 
see reserve for losses and loss expenses below for further discussion 
the company s loss and loss expense reserves are reviewed regularly  and adjustments  if any  are reflected in earnings in the period in which they become known 
the establishment of new loss and loss expense reserves or the adjustment of previously recorded loss and loss expense reserves could result in significant positive or negative changes to the company s financial condition for any particular period 
while we believe that we have made a reasonable estimate of loss and loss expense reserves  the ultimate loss experience may not be as reliably predicted as may be the case with other insurance and reinsurance operations  and it is possible that losses and loss expenses will be higher or lower than the total reserve for losses and loss expenses recorded by the company 
information used in determining the reserve for losses and loss expenses 
in order to estimate the company s reserve for losses and loss expenses  management uses information either developed from internal or independent external sources  or pricing information created by the company or provided to the company by insureds and brokers at the time individual contracts and policies are bound 
in addition  we use commercially available risk analysis models  contract by contract review by our underwriting teams and  to a limited extent  overall market share assumptions to estimate our loss and loss expense reserves related to specific loss events 
actuarial methods used to estimate loss and loss expense reserves 
when the applicable information has been obtained  the company uses a variety of actuarial methods to estimate the ultimate losses and loss expenses incurred by the company in connection with business it has underwritten and thus  the applicable reserve for losses and loss expenses 
one actuarial method used by the company to estimate its reserve for losses and loss expenses is the expected loss ratio approach  which is based on expected results independent of current loss reporting activity 
this approach is typically used for immature loss periods ie  the current accident year 
another actuarial method used by the company is known as the bornhuetter ferguson method 
the bornhuetter ferguson method uses an initial loss estimate expected loss technique for each underwriting quarter by business line and type of contract 
the portion of the initial loss estimate that is the ibnr reserve is then reduced in each subsequent quarter by the losses reported for that business segment during that quarter 
over time  the ibnr reserve will be reduced and will be replaced with the actual losses reported to the company or  if losses do not develop as expected  reserves for those losses are reduced with the amounts by which reserves are reduced then reflected in net income 
management uses these multiple actuarial methods  supplemented with its own professional judgment  to establish its best estimate of reserves for losses and loss expenses 
the information gathered by the company and the actuarial analyses performed on the gathered information is used to develop individual point estimates of carried loss and loss expense reserves for each of the company s business segments and underlying lines of business 
these individual point estimates are then aggregated along with actual losses reported to reach the total reserve for losses and loss expenses carried in the company s consolidated financial statements 
all of the company s loss reserving is currently performed on a point estimate basis 
the company does not utilize range estimation in its loss reserving process 

table of contents since inception  the company has used reserving methods that are commonly applied when limited loss development experience exists 
in order to capture the key dynamics of loss development and expected volatility that may arise within the disclosed amounts for the reserve for losses and loss expenses  the key lines of business within each business segment are aggregated based on their potential expected length of loss emergence 
the period over which loss emergence occurs is typically referred to as the tail 
the company has classified its lines of business as either having a short  long or other tail pattern 
as the company has accumulated its own loss reserve history  it has determined it is more appropriate to incorporate the company s actual loss experience 
as of  the company determined that its own loss development history in relation to its short tail and other lines of business had reached a level of maturity sufficient to provide a credible basis on which to estimate its reserve for losses and loss expenses related to these lines of buinsess 
as such  the company s actual reporting patterns were considered when determining the reserve for losses and loss expenses in the short tail and other lines of business in its reinsurance and insurance segments for the year ended december  the company continues to utilize industry loss and development patterns in the establishment of loss and loss expense reserves for its long tail and certain other lines of business in both its insurance and reinsurance segments 
significant assumptions employed in the estimation of loss and loss expense reserves 
the most significant assumptions used as of december  to estimate the reserve for losses and loss expenses within the company s insurance and reinsurance segments are as follows the information developed from internal and independent external sources can be used to develop meaningful estimates of the likely future performance of business bound by the company  the loss and exposure information provided by ceding companies  insureds and brokers in support of their submissions can be used to derive meaningful estimates of the likely future performance of business bound with respect to each contract and policy  historic loss development and trend experience is assumed to be indicative of future loss development and trends  and no significant emergence of losses or types of losses that are not represented in the information supplied to the company by its brokers  ceding companies and insureds will occur 
the above four assumptions most significantly influence the company s determination of initial expected loss ratios and expected loss reporting patterns that are the key inputs which impact potential variability in the estimate of the reserve for losses and loss expenses and are applicable to each of the company s business segments 
while there can be no assurance that any of the above assumptions will prove to be correct  we believe that these assumptions represent a realistic and appropriate basis for estimating the reserve for losses and loss expenses 
factors creating uncertainty in the estimation of the reserve for losses and loss expenses 
while management does not at this time include an explicit or implicit provision for uncertainty in its reserve for losses and loss expenses  certain of the company s business lines are by their nature subject to additional uncertainties  including the company s casualty  property  catastrophe  aerospace and marine and surety and other specialty lines in the reinsurance segment and the company s casualty and professional lines in the insurance segment  which are discussed in detail below 
in addition  the company s reinsurance segment is subject to additional factors which add to the uncertainty of estimating loss and loss expense reserves 
time lags in the reporting of losses can also introduce further ambiguity to the process of estimating loss and loss expense reserves 
the aspects of the company s casualty line in the reinsurance segment and the casualty and professional lines in the insurance segment that complicate the process of estimating loss reseves include the lack of long term historical data for losses of the same type intended to be covered by the policies and contracts written by the company and the expectation that a portion of losses in excess of the company s attachment levels in many of its contracts will be low in frequency and high in severity  limiting the usefulness of claims experience of other insurers and reinsurers for similar claims 
in addition  the portion of the company s casualty line in its insurance segment which is underwritten in bermuda includes policy forms that vary from more traditional policy forms 
the primary difference in the casualty policy form used by endurance bermuda from more traditional policy forms relates to the coverage being provided on an occurrence reported basis instead of the typical occurrence or claims made basis used in traditional policy forms 
the occurrence reported policy forms typically cover occurrences causing unexpected and unintended personal injury or property damage to third parties arising from events or conditions that commence at or subsequent to an inception date  and prior to the expiration of the policy provided that proper notice is given during the term of the policy or the discovery period 

table of contents the inherent uncertainty of estimating the company s loss and loss expense reserves for its reinsurance segment increases principally due to i the lag in time between the time claims are reported to the ceding company and the time they are reported through one or more reinsurance broker intermediaries to the company  ii the differing reserving practices among ceding companies  iii the diversity of loss development patterns among different types of reinsurance treaties or contracts  and iv the company s need to rely on its ceding companies for loss information 
in order to verify the accuracy and completeness of the information provided to the company by its ceding company counterparties  the company s underwriters  actuaries  accounting and claims personnel perform underwriting and claims reviews of the company s ceding companies 
any material findings are communicated to the ceding companies and utilized in the establishment or revision of the company s case reserves and related ibnr reserve 
on occasion  these reviews reveal that the ceding company s reported losses and loss expenses do not comport with the terms of the contract with the company 
in such events  the company strives to resolve the outstanding differences in an amicable fashion 
the large majority of such differences are resolved in this manner 
in the infrequent instance where an amicable solution is not feasible  the company s policy is to vigorously defend its position in litigation or arbitration 
as of december   the company was not involved in any material claims litigation or arbitration proceedings 
due to the large volume of potential transactions that must be recorded in the insurance and reinsurance industry  backlogs in the recording of the company s business activities can also impair the accuracy of its loss and loss expense reserve estimates 
as of december   there were no significant backlogs related to the processing of policy or contract information in the company s insurance or reinsurance segments 
the company assumes in its loss and loss expense reserving process that  on average  the time periods between the recording of expected losses and the reporting of actual losses are predictable when measured in the aggregate and over time 
the time period over which all losses are expected to be reported to the company varies significantly by line of business 
this period can range from a few quarters for some lines  such as catastrophe  to many years for some casualty lines of business 
for the company s reinsurance business segment  due to ceding company and reinsurance intermediary reporting frequency  the time period is generally longer than for its insurance segment  resulting in a reliance by the company for a longer period of time on its actuarial estimates of loss and loss expense reserves 
to the extent that actual reported losses are reported more quickly than expected  the company may adjust upward its estimate of ultimate loss and to the extent that actual reported losses are reported more slowly than expected  the company may reduce its estimate of ultimate loss 
potential volatility in the reserve for losses and loss expenses 
in addition to the factors creating uncertainty in the company s estimate of loss and loss expense reserves  the company s estimated reserve for losses and loss expenses can change over time because of unexpected changes in the external environment 
potential changing external factors include changes in the inflation rate for goods and services related to the covered damages  changes in the general economic environment that could cause unanticipated changes in claim frequency or severity  changes in the litigation environment regarding the representation of plaintiffs and potential plaintiffs  changes in the judicial and or arbitration environment regarding the interpretation of policy and contract provisions relating to the determination of coverage and or the amount of damages awarded for certain types of claims  changes in the social environment regarding the general attitude of juries in the determination of liability and damages  changes in the legislative environment regarding the definition of damages  new types of injuries caused by new types of injurious activities or exposures  and in the case of assumed reinsurance  changes in ceding company case reserving and reporting patterns 

table of contents the company s estimates of reserves for losses and loss expenses can also change over time because of changes in internal company operations  such as alterations in claims handling procedures  growth in new lines of business where exposure and loss development patterns are not well established  or changes in the quality of risk selection or pricing in the underwriting process 
due to the inherent complexity of the assumptions used in establishing the company s loss and loss expense reserve estimates  final claim settlements made by the company may vary significantly from the present estimates  particularly when those settlements may not occur until well into the future 
for an illustration of the effect of a change in the company s two key inputs used in determining its loss and loss expense reserves the expected loss ratio and the expected loss reporting pattern please see reserve for losses and loss expenses below 
investments 
the company currently classifies its entire fixed income portfolio  which consists of fixed maturity investments  short term investments and preferred equity securities  as available for sale and  accordingly  they are carried at estimated fair value  with related net unrealized gains or losses excluded from earnings and included in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the company determines the fair value of its fixed income portfolio in accordance with current accounting guidance  which defines fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy based on inputs to the various valuation techniques used for each fair value measurement 
the use of valuation techniques for any given investment requires a significant amount of judgment and consideration of factors specific to the underlying investment 
fair value measurements determined by the company seek to maximize observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
current accounting guidance establishes three levels as follows level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level quoted prices for similar assets in markets that are active  quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly 
level inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities other than quoted prices in level  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
unobservable inputs reflect the company s own views about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
level assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose values are determined using pricing models  discounted cash flow methodologies  or similar techniques  as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation 
the company determines the estimated fair value of each individual security utilizing the highest level inputs available 
the company uses quoted values and other data provided by nationally recognized independent pricing sources as inputs into its process for determining fair values of its fixed income portfolio 
the company obtains multiple prices for its securities where available 
pricing sources used in pricing the company s fixed income portfolio at december  were as follows pricing services index providers broker dealers pricing services and index providers 
pricing services  including index providers  provide pricing for less complex  liquid securities based on market quotations in active markets 
for securities that do not trade on a listed exchange  these pricing services may use a matrix pricing consisting of observable market inputs to estimate the fair value of a security 
these observable market inputs include reported trades  benchmark yields  broker dealer quotes  issuer spreads  two sided markets  benchmark securities  bids  offers  reference data  and industry and economic factors 
additionally  pricing services may use a valuation model such as an option adjusted spread model commonly used for estimating fair values of mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
at december   the company has not adjusted any pricing provided by independent pricing services and index providers and have classified all such securities as level 
table of contents broker dealers 
generally  the company obtains quotes directly from broker dealers who are active in the corresponding markets when prices are unavailable from independent pricing services or index providers 
broker dealer quotes may also be used if the pricing from pricing services or index providers is not reflective of current market levels  as detected by our pricing control tolerance procedures 
generally  broker dealers value securities through their trading desks based on observable market inputs 
their pricing methodologies include mapping securities based on trade data  bids or offers  observed spreads and performance on newly issued securities 
they may also establish pricing through observing secondary trading of similar securities 
quotes from broker dealers are all non binding 
at december   the company has not adjusted any pricing provided by broker dealers and has classified all such securities as level as described above  independent pricing services  index providers and broker dealers have their own method for determining the fair value of securities 
as such  prices provided by independent pricing services  index providers and independent broker quotes can vary widely  even for the same security  and may have a material effect on the estimated fair values of the company s securities 
if the company determines that there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of trading activity for the securities in relation to the normal market activity for such security or similar securities  then transactions or quoted prices may not accurately reflect fair value and  if there is evidence that the transaction for the security is not orderly  the company may place less weight on the transaction price as an indicator of fair value 
to validate the techniques or models used by pricing sources  the company s review process includes  but is not limited to i quantitative analysis eg  comparing the quarterly return for each managed portfolio to its target benchmark  with significant differences identified and investigated  ii initial and ongoing evaluation of methodologies used by outside parties to calculate fair value  and iii comparing the fair value estimates to its knowledge of the current market 
based on the above review  the company will challenge any prices for a security that are not considered representative of fair value 
the company s available for sale investments are comprised of a variety of different securities  which are grouped based on the valuation technique and inputs used in their valuation 
the valuation of current issue us government securities is generally based on level inputs  which use the market approach valuation technique 
the valuation of the company s other available for sale investments  including non current us government and agency securities  us state  municipal and foreign government securities  government guaranteed and other corporate debt  us agency and non agency residential and commercial mortgage backed securities  asset backed securities  short term investments and preferred equity securities generally incorporate significant level inputs using the market and income approach techniques 
level includes any available for sale investments that use unobservable inputs  which will vary from period to period 
for mortgage backed and other asset backed debt securities  fair value includes estimates regarding prepayment assumptions  which are based on current market conditions 
amortized cost in relation to these securities is calculated using a constant effective yield based on anticipated prepayments and the estimated economic life of the security 
when actual prepayments differ significantly from anticipated prepayments  the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date 
for the majority of these securities  changes in estimated yield are recorded on a retrospective basis  resulting in future cash flows determining current book value 
other than temporary impairment 
following a determination of fair value  the company reviews its fixed income portfolio to determine whether any declines in the fair value below the amortized cost basis of its fixed income portfolio are other than temporary 
if the company determines that a decision to sell the security has been made or that it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the security  the company deems the security to be other than temporarily impaired and writes it down to fair value  thereby establishing a new cost basis 
the amount of the write down is recognized in earnings as an other than temporary impairment otti loss 

table of contents for the remaining fixed income investments in an unrealized loss position for which a decision to sell has not been made and it is more likely than not that the company will not be required to sell  the company performs additional reviews to determine whether the investment will recover its amortized cost 
analysis and reviews performed to determine if the amortized cost of the company s fixed income portfolio is likely to be recovered include the following actions  among others  depending on the type of security being reviewed or tested analysis to determine cash flow projections under base and stressed case scenarios using historical information to determine significant inputs such as expected default rates  delinquency rates  foreclosure costs  etc  review of credit ratings  expected loss tables by ratings  default rated securities  sector weaknesses and business prospects  review of information obtained from asset managers  credit agencies and industry reports or other publicly available information  review of the time period in which there has been a significant decline in value  and review of the payment structure of the security  whether scheduled interest and principal payments have been made  current levels of subordination and any guarantees  if applicable 
if the amortized cost of the company s fixed income portfolio is  based upon the judgment of management  unlikely to be recovered  the company writes down the investment by the amount representing the credit related portion of the decline in value  thereby establishing a new cost basis 
the amount of the write down is recognized in earnings as an otti loss 
the new cost basis is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 
to the extent the company determines that the amortized cost of the company s fixed income portfolio is likely to be recovered and related to non credit factors such as interest rates  market conditions  etc 
and not due to credit related factors  that remaining non credit portion of the unrealized loss is recorded as a part of accumulated other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of the company s balance sheet 
other investments 
other investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting whereby the initial investment is recorded at cost 
other investments consist largely of alternative funds that invest in senior secured bank debt  high yield securities  distressed debt  distressed real estate  derivatives and equity long short strategies and high yield loan funds 
the carrying value of these investments are increased or decreased to reflect the company s share of income or loss  which is included in net investment income  and are decreased for dividends 
due to the timing of the delivery of the final valuations reported by the managers of certain of our alternative funds  our investments in those alternative funds are estimated based on the most recently available information including period end valuation statements  period end estimates  or  in some cases  prior month or quarter valuation statements 
investments in high yield loan funds are reported as of the current date 
goodwill 
the company is required to make an annual assessment as to whether the value of the company s goodwill asset is impaired 
impairment  which can be either partial or full  is based on a fair value analysis by individual reporting unit 
based upon the company s assessment at the reporting unit level  there was no impairment of its goodwill asset of million as of december  in making an assessment of the value of its goodwill  the company uses both market based and non market based valuations 
assumptions underlying these valuations include forecasts of discounted future cash flows and future profits in addition to an analysis of the company s stock price relative to both its book value and its net income 
significant changes in the data underlying these assumptions could result in an assessment of impairment of the company s goodwill asset 
in addition  if the current economic environment and or the company s financial performance were to deteriorate significantly  this could lead to an impairment of goodwill  the write off of which would be recorded against net income in the period such deterioration occurred 
if a decline in the fair value of the reporting units occurred  this would not result in an impairment of the goodwill asset at december  deferred tax assets 
we provide for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of the relevant accounting guidance on  accounting for income taxes and accounting for uncertain tax positions  for endurance reinsurance  endurance american  endurance american specialty  endurance risk solutions  armtech and endurance uk  which are our operating subsidiaries in income tax paying jurisdictions 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily result from the net tax effect of temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our audited consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities separately for each tax paying component in each tax jurisdiction 

table of contents at each balance sheet date  management assesses the need to establish a valuation allowance that reduces deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all  or some portion  of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the valuation allowance is based on all available information including projections of future taxable income from each tax paying component in each tax jurisdiction and available tax planning strategies 
estimates of future taxable income incorporate several assumptions that may differ from actual experience 
differences in our assumptions and resulting estimates could be material and have an adverse impact on our financial results of operations and liquidity 
any such differences are recorded in the period in which they become known

table of contents net impairment losses recognized in earnings during  and  the company identified available for sale securities that were considered to be other than temporarily impaired 
during the second quarter of  the company adopted new accounting guidance related to identifying whether an investment is considered to be other than temporarily impaired  which is described in note d  summary of significant accounting policies investments  of the notes accompanying our audited consolidated financial statements 
as a result  the company initially considered whether it intended to sell or would be more likely than not required to sell the securities in an unrealized loss position at december  the company did not identify any such securities meeting these criteria 
as such  the company performed various analysis and reviews  to determine whether the investments in an unrealized loss position were other than temporarily impaired as a result of credit factors or non credit related factors 
other than temporary impairment losses recognized in earnings for the years ended december   and were as follows us dollars in thousands other than temporary impairment losses portion of loss recognized in other comprehensive income loss net impairment losses recognized in earnings the million of other than temporary impairment losses recognized by the company in relating to specific credit events occurred primarily due to reductions in expected recovery values on mortgage and asset backed securities during the period 
for the years ended december  and  the company recorded million and million of otti losses in earnings  respectively 
these amounts included a portion related to credit losses and a portion related to non credit factors 
non credit related factors included market and sector related factors such as limited liquidity and credit spread widening 
as of december   the company maintained an investment portfolio with an average credit rating of aa 
the company s investment portfolio consists of both mortgage backed and asset backed securities  which comprised of total invested assets  including pending securities transactions  fixed maturity investments  short term investments  preferred equity securities  cash and cash equivalents and other investments  at december  the company  along with its investment managers  monitors the nature and type of assets underlying these types of securities 
at december   the company s portfolio held no sub prime mortgage exposure and the company s alt a exposure represented of the company s fixed income portfolio 
of the company s alt a exposure  are fixed rate securities 
net foreign exchange gains losses during  the company revalued its monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies  which resulted in net foreign exchange gains of million compared to gains of million for and losses of million for the gains recorded in the current period were primarily due to the revaluation of foreign denominated cash  receivables and net insurance liabilities as the us dollar fluctuated in mixed directions against other major currencies 
the net foreign exchange gains recorded in resulted from the strengthening of the british sterling and weakening of the us dollar over that period 
the net foreign exchange losses recorded in resulted from the strengthening of the us dollar and weakening of the british sterling compared to other currencies over that period 
net losses and loss expenses the company s reported net losses and loss expenses are characterized by various factors and are significantly impacted by the occurrence or absence of catastrophic events and subsequent loss emergence related to such events 
in  the chilean earthquake  the new zealand earthquake and european windstorm xynthia adversely affected the company s net loss ratio in the reinsurance segment 
the company s recorded losses  net of reinstatement premiums and other loss sensitive accruals  added percentage points to the company s net loss ratio for in addition  the company maintained reserves for attritional losses to reflect a number of smaller catastrophes that occurred in a small number of individual risk casualty events adversely impacted losses incurred in the insurance segment in the impact of the increased loss activity in was partially offset by improved crop growing conditions in the us resulting in a lower loss ratio in the agriculture line of business of the insurance segment compared to the prior two years 
in  the company s net loss ratio benefited from a relative absence of major catastrophes 
in net losses and loss expenses were adversely impacted by losses from hurricanes gustav and ike and severe weather and worse than expected growing conditions and lower prices for major crops in the us  which adversely impacted the agriculture line of the insurance segment 

table of contents during  and  the company s previously estimated ultimate losses for prior accident years were reduced by million  million and million  respectively  as the loss emergence related to prior accident years was lower than expected  resulting in the reserves held by the company for those accident years being moderately redundant 
the overall net reduction in the company s estimated losses for prior accident years experienced in emerged in the company s short tail  long tail and other lines of both the insurance and reinsurance segments 
the company participates in lines of business where claims may not be reported for many years 
accordingly  management does not believe that reported claims are the only valid means for estimating ultimate obligations 
ultimate losses and loss expenses may differ materially from the amounts recorded in the company s consolidated financial statements 
these estimates are reviewed regularly and  as experience develops and new information becomes known  the reserves are adjusted as necessary 
as a result of the incorporation of the company s own loss reporting patterns and loss history related to its short tail business  including catastrophe reinsurance and property insurance and reinsurance business lines  the company would expect its prior year loss reserve development and adjustments for short tail business to be less than recorded in prior years 
reserve adjustments  if any  are recorded in earnings in the period in which they are determined 
the overall loss reserves were established by the company s actuaries and reflect management s best estimate of ultimate losses 
see reserve for losses and loss expenses below for further discussion 
acquisition expenses the company s acquisition expense ratio decreased in as compared to and primarily due to shifts in the earned premium mix  notably within the insurance segment as earned premiums have increased in the agriculture line of business and decreased in the workers compensation line of business that had higher commission rates which the company exited during general and administrative expenses the company s general and administrative expense ratio for decreased compared to and increased compared to the reduction as compared to was primarily due to higher earned premiums in the reinsurance segment  partially offset by an increase in overall expenditures which was driven by higher professional service fees and lower expense reimbursements in the agriculture line of the insurance segment 
the increase in the expense ratio compared to was as a result of higher incentive compensation expenses in and lower expense reimbursements in the agriculture line of the insurance segment 
at december   the company had a total of employees as compared to employees at december  and employees at december  income tax expense benefit the company incurred a tax expense for the year ended december  of million compared to tax benefits of million and million for the years ended december  and the company incurred additional taxes in due to the increase in income generated in its us taxable jurisdictions compared to and net income the company produced net income of million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in net income for compared to was partly due to a decrease in net investment income of million related primarily to mark to market adjustments on the company s other investments and a lower yielding fixed income portfolio 
in addition  the company experienced higher losses incurred in than arising from specific events including the chilean earthquake  the new zealand earthquake and european windstorm xynthia as well as higher attritional catastrophe losses 

table of contents underwriting results by business segment the determination of the company s business segments is based on the manner in which management monitors the performance of the company s underwriting operations 
as a result  we report two business segments insurance and reinsurance 
management measures the company s results on the basis of the combined ratio  which is obtained by dividing the sum of the losses and loss expenses  acquisition expenses and general and administrative expenses by net premiums earned 
the company s historic combined ratios may not be indicative of future underwriting performance 
when purchased within a single line of business  ceded reinsurance and recoveries are accounted for within that line of business 
when purchased across multiple lines of business  ceded reinsurance and recoveries are allocated to the lines of business in proportion to the related risks assumed 
the company does not manage its assets by business segment  accordingly  investment income and total assets are not allocated to the individual business segments 
general and administrative expenses incurred by business segments are allocated directly 
remaining general and administrative expenses not directly incurred by the segments are allocated primarily based on estimated consumption  headcount and other variables deemed relevant to the allocation of such expenses 
ceded reinsurance and recoveries are recorded within the segment to which they apply

table of contents premiums 
net premiums written in the insurance segment increased in by compared to and decreased compared to  respectively

the company decreased its ceded premiums to the federal crop insurance corporation and reduced third party reinsurance purchases 
the increase in net premiums written due to reduced cessions was partially offset by a decline in gross premiums written in the agriculture line for the current year compared to the prior year as reduced commodity price volatility resulted in a decline in rates  increased premium retentions in the us based property business resulting from changes in the company s third party reinsurance program implemented in  growth in the casualty line of business as a result of modest levels of new premiums written combined with increased premium retentions  reduced premiums written in the professional lines as the company nonrenewed a portion of the business due to increased competition and significant rate reductions  and a decline in workers compensation premiums written as a result of the company s exit from this line of business in the first quarter of the change in the insurance business segment net premiums written in compared to was driven primarily by the company s exit from the california workers compensation market in the first quarter of  which contributed million of net premiums written in this was partially offset by modest growth in net premiums written in the professional  agriculture and casualty lines of business 
ceded premiums written by the company in the insurance segment decreased in compared to as the company retained a higher proportion of premiums in the agriculture and property lines of business

currency and foreign exchange the company s functional currencies are us dollars for its us and bermuda operations and british sterling for its uk operations 
the reporting currency for all entities is us dollars 
the company maintains a portion of its investments and liabilities in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company has made a significant investment in the capitalization of endurance u 
k which was valued at million as of december  endurance uk is subject to the united kingdom s financial services authority rules concerning the matching of the currency of its assets to the currency of its liabilities

table of contents effects of inflation the effects of inflation could cause the severity of claims to rise in the future 
the company s estimates for losses and loss expenses include assumptions about future payments for settlement of claims and claims handling expenses  such as medical treatments and litigation costs 
to the extent inflation causes these costs to increase above reserves established for these claims  the company will be required to increase the reserve for losses and loss expenses with a corresponding reduction in its earnings in the period in which the deficiency is identified 
in addition  inflation could lead to higher interest rates causing the current unrealized gain position on the company s fixed income portfolio to decrease 
the current short duration of the company s fixed income portfolio has the potential to help reduce the negative effects of higher interest rates on the company s fixed income portfolio 
the company may also choose to hold its fixed income portfolio to maturity which would result in the unrealized gains largely amortizing through net investment income 
reserve for losses and loss expenses reserving process the company establishes loss and loss expense reserves to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims under insurance policies and reinsurance contracts underwritten by the company 
these reserves include estimates for both claims that have been reported and those that have been incurred but not reported and include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling these claims 
estimating the ultimate cost of future claims and claim adjustment expenses is an uncertain and complex process 
this estimation process is based largely on the assumption that past developments are an appropriate predictor of future events and involves a variety of actuarial techniques and judgments that analyze experience  trends and other relevant factors 
the company s reserving actuaries  who are independent of the company s business units  review the company s loss and loss expense reserves on a quarterly basis for both current and prior accident years using the most current claims data 
these reserve reviews incorporate a variety of actuarial methods and judgments  including the three most common methods of actuarial evaluation used within the insurance industry the expected loss ratio method  the bornhuetter ferguson method  and the loss development method 
the expected loss ratio approach is based on expected results independent of current loss reporting activity 
this approach is typically used for immature loss periods ie  the current accident year 
the bornhuetter ferguson method involves the application of selected loss ratios to the company s earned premiums to determine estimates of ultimate expected unpaid claims and claims expenses for each underwriting year 
when the ibnr reserves are added to the losses and loss expenses amounts with respect to claims that have been reported to date  an estimated ultimate expected loss results 
the company believes that this method provides a more stable estimate of ibnr reserves that is insulated from wide variations in reported losses 
in contrast  the loss development method extrapolates the current value of reported losses to ultimate expected losses by using selected reporting patterns of losses over time 
the selected reporting patterns are based on historical information organized into loss development triangles and are adjusted to reflect the changing characteristics of the book of business written by the company 
the company uses these multiple methods  supplemented with its own actuarial and professional judgment  to establish its best estimate of loss and loss expense reserves 
the estimate of the reserve for losses and loss expenses is reviewed each quarter by the company s loss reserve committee  consisting of the company s chief executive officer  president  chief financial officer  chief actuary and representatives of various disciplines from within the company  such as claims  underwriting and legal 
current reserve for losses and loss expenses in order to capture the key dynamics of loss development and expected volatility that may arise within the disclosed amounts for the reserve for losses and loss expenses  the key lines of business within each business segment are aggregated based on their potential expected length of loss emergence 
the period over which loss emergence occurs is typically referred to as the tail 
the company has classified its lines of business as either having a short  long or other tail pattern 
the company views short tail business as that for which development typically emerges within a period of several quarters while long tail business would emerge over many years 
the company s short tail lines of business in the insurance segment includes property  long tail lines of business include casualty  healthcare liability  workers compensation and professional lines  and other tail lines of business include certain specialty lines of business for which loss emergence is considered unique in nature  such as the company s agriculture insurance business 
the company s short tail lines of business in the reinsurance segment include catastrophe  property  aerospace and marine and surety while the long tail line of business is casualty related business 
within the company s reinsurance segment  the company writes certain specialty lines of business for which the loss emergence is considered unique in nature and thus  has been included as other in the table below 

table of contents as more fully described under reserving process above  the company incorporates a variety of actuarial methods and judgments in its reserving process 
two key inputs in the various actuarial methods employed by the company are initial expected loss ratios and expected loss reporting patterns 
these key inputs impact the potential variability in the estimate of the reserve for losses and loss expenses and are applicable to each of the company s business segments 
the company s loss and loss expense reserves consider and reflect  in part  deviations resulting from differences between expected loss and actual loss reporting as well as judgments relating to the weights applied to the reserve levels indicated by the actuarial methods 
expected loss reporting patterns are based upon internal and external historical data and assumptions regarding claims reporting trends over a period of time that extends beyond the company s own operating history 
differences between actual reported losses and expected losses are anticipated to occur in any individual period and such deviations may influence future initial expected loss ratios and or expected loss reporting patterns as recent actual experience becomes part of the historical data utilized as part of the ongoing reserve estimation process 
the company has demonstrated the impact of changes in the speed of loss reporting patterns  as well as changes in expected loss ratios  within the table under the heading potential variability in reserves for losses and loss expenses beginning on page losses and loss expenses for the year ended december  are summarized as follows incurred related to total incurred current year prior years losses us dollars in thousands insurance segment short tail long tail other total insurance reinsurance segment short tail long tail other total reinsurance totals losses and loss expenses for the year ended december  include million in favorable development of reserves relating to prior accident years 
the favorable loss reserve development experienced during the year benefited the company s reported loss ratio by approximately percentage points 
the net reduction in estimated losses for prior accident years reflects lower than expected loss emergence in each of the company s reserve categories within both the insurance and reinsurance segments 
for the year ended december   for the vast majority of our business  the company did not materially alter the two key inputs it utilizes to establish its reserve for losses and loss expenses  initial expected loss ratios or loss reporting patterns  for business related to prior years for the insurance and reinsurance reserve categories as the variances in reported losses in for those reserve categories were within the range of possible results anticipated by the company 
for the insurance workers compensation line of business we increased our prior initial expected loss ratios and for the bermuda based healthcare insurance line we decreased our prior initial expected loss ratios to recognize the emerging loss experience within those lines 

table of contents insurance short tail insurance 
the prior year favorable loss development in the short tail insurance reserve category during was primarily as a result of lower than expected claims reported and favorable case reserve development in the company s property line of business 
as a result  the company reduced its estimated losses and loss expenses related to prior years in this reserve category during long tail insurance 
the favorable loss emergence within the long tail insurance reserve category during was primarily due to lower than expected claims activity and favorable case settlement within the bermuda based healthcare liability  casualty and professional lines of business 
this favorable loss emergence was partially offset by adverse loss development in us based primary and excess casualty and the workers compensation line of business 
the company exited the workers compensation business in other insurance 
lower than anticipated agriculture claims settlements for the crop year resulted in a reduction in prior years estimated loss and loss expenses within this reserve category during reinsurance short tail reinsurance 
the company recorded favorable loss emergence within this reserve category primarily due to lower than expected claims activity and favorable case reserve development within the catastrophe  treaty property  surety and other specialty  and property lines of business 
long tail reinsurance 
the company recorded a modest amount of favorable prior period development within this reserve category overall  primarily within the professional liability line of business due to lower than anticipated claim activity 
other reinsurance 
the company recorded a modest amount of favorable prior period development in this reserve category due to lower than expected claims reported within the personal accident and agriculture lines of business

table of contents short tail insurance 
the prior year favorable loss development in the short tail insurance category was primarily as a result of lower than expected claims reported and favorable case reserve development in the company s property line of business 
as a result  the company reduced its estimated losses and loss expenses related to prior years in this reserve category during long tail insurance 
the favorable loss emergence during within the long tail insurance reserve category was primarily due to lower than expected claims activity and favorable case settlement within the healthcare liability line of business 
the favorable loss emergence in healthcare liability was partially offset by adverse loss development in the workers compensation line of business resulting from the company s review of industry trends and potential claim cost changes due to medical inflation 
in addition  the company also experienced adverse loss emergence related to credit crisis exposures within the professional lines of business 
other insurance 
the company recorded favorable loss emergence within this reserve category during due to lower than anticipated claims settlements for the crop year in the agriculture line of business 
short tail reinsurance 
the company recorded favorable loss emergence within this reserve category primarily due to lower than expected claims activity and favorable case reserve development within the catastrophe  surety and other specialty  and property lines of business and the aerospace portion of the aerospace and marine line of business 
the favorable emergence was partially offset by unfavorable loss development within the marine portion of the aerospace and marine line of business 
long tail reinsurance 
the company recorded a modest amount of favorable loss emergence within this reserve category during for the year  the company experienced favorable prior period development within the direct casualty and professional liability lines of business due to lower than anticipated claim activity 
this was partially offset by adverse development within the casualty line of business  primarily due to higher than expected reported loss activity from prior years 
other reinsurance 
favorable loss emergence in the other reinsurance reserve category was due to lower than expected loss activity within the agriculture  personal accident  self insured and special accounts lines of business 
the agriculture line of business contributed a significant amount to the favorable development which resulted from lower than anticipated claim settlements for the crop year

for a discussion of the factors which can contribute to uncertainty in the reserving process and volatility in the reserve for losses and loss expenses  see critical accounting estimates reserves for losses and loss expenses above 

table of contents two key inputs utilized in determining loss and loss expense reserves for the company s two business segments are the initial expected loss ratio and the speed of the loss reporting pattern 
the following tables illustrate the possible percentage effects on current estimates of the reserve for losses and loss expenses due to changes in the initial expected loss ratio and the speed of the loss reporting pattern as of december  the changes in the initial expected loss ratio and the speed of the loss reporting pattern in the tables below were chosen consistent with commonly accepted actuarial practice  due to the company s limited empirical data regarding loss and loss expense reserves variability 
in order to capture the key dynamics of loss development and expected volatility that may arise within the disclosed amounts for the reserve for losses and loss expenses  the lines of business within each business segment are aggregated based on their potential expected length of loss emergence or tail

table of contents other potential percentage change in total loss and loss expense reserves expected loss ratio reporting pattern lower unchanged higher faster unchanged slower the other reserve category of the insurance segment includes agricultural business written by the company 
reporting pattern changes are not applicable to agricultural business as it is typically settled at an established time each year 
each of the impacts set forth in the tables above is estimated individually  without consideration for any correlation among key assumptions or among lines of business 
therefore  it would be inappropriate to take each of the amounts set forth above and add them together in an attempt to estimate volatility for the company s loss and loss expense reserves in total 
the company believes the assumed variations in loss and loss expense reserves by individual development tail set forth in the tables above represents a reasonable estimate of the possible loss and loss expense reserve variations by individual development tail that may occur in the future 
it is important to note that the variations set forth in the tables above are not meant to be a best case or worst case series of scenarios  and therefore  it is possible that future variations may be more or less than the amounts set forth above 
ceded reinsurance ceded premiums written were million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the decrease in ceded premiums written was due to increased retentions in our us insurance operations  specifically related to the agriculture and property lines 
the company s us and bermuda insurance operating subsidiaries use proportional and excess reinsurance to protect larger limits on certain business written by this segment 
excess reinsurance coverage is often purchased in relation to the property insurance line to protect against catastrophic events 
our agriculture line of business participates in a crop reinsurance program sponsored by the us federal government 
at december  and  the company had reinsurance recoverables of million and million  respectively  related to its reinsurance agreements 
the company remains obligated for amounts ceded in the event that its reinsurers or retrocessionaires do not meet their obligations  except for amounts ceded related to the agriculture line of business 
accordingly  the company has evaluated the reinsurers and retrocessionaires that are providing reinsurance and retrocessional protection and will continue to monitor the stability of its reinsurers and retrocessionaires 
no allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was deemed necessary on the recoverable balances outstanding at december  and goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and other intangibles that arise from business combinations are accounted for by the company in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets 
the accounting literature requires that identifiable intangible assets are amortized in accordance with their useful lives and goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives should not be amortized but should be tested for impairment at least annually 
the company s intangible assets and goodwill are tested at least annually for impairment and more often if a triggering event is deemed to have occurred 
impairment testing is performed based upon estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill relates 
the reporting unit is the operating segment or a business one level below that operating segment if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at that level 
the fair value of the reporting unit is impacted by the performance of the business 
if it is determined that the goodwill has been impaired  the company must write down the goodwill by the amount of the impairment  with a corresponding charge to net income 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of  the company performed its annual impairment testing of goodwill 
the company has two primary sources of goodwill goodwill obtained from a renewal rights transaction completed in with hartre and goodwill obtained from the company s acquisition of armtech in the company determined that the appropriate reporting units for evaluation were the reinsurance segment in relation to hartre goodwill and the insurance segment for armtech goodwill 
the company used a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of these reporting units 
the fair value determined was in excess of the carrying value including goodwill for both reporting units noted 
as a result of the impairment testing  no write downs were deemed necessary at december  and deferred tax assets and liabilities the company is subject to income taxes in certain jurisdictions in which the company operates  however  since the majority of the company s income is currently earned in bermuda  a jurisdiction with no corporate income tax  the tax impact to the company s operations has historically been minimal 
in  the company generated cumulative income before income taxes in its subsidiaries  which generated a consolidated effective income tax rate 
in  certain subsidiaries of the company in the us generated taxable losses largely contributing to the company s income tax benefit 
a larger proportion of the company s income before income taxes was generated in jurisdictions with a corporate income tax in versus the company s balance sheet at december  contains a net deferred tax asset in the amount of million million deferred tax asset 
the current year net deferred tax asset consists of gross deferred tax assets of million  gross deferred tax liabilities of million and a valuation allowance of million 
of the company s gross deferred tax assets  million million relates to net operating loss carryforwards that are available to offset future taxable income generated by the company s uk subsidiary 
the company s net operating losses may be carried forward indefinitely 
the company has established a valuation allowance of million million against certain operating loss carryforwards at december  the million valuation allowance was established against net operating loss carryforwards in the united kingdom as the company does not expect to generate enough operating income in the short term to offset the full amount of the carryforwards 
the increase in the valuation allowance was charged to the company s income tax expense during management believes the net deferred tax assets  less the valuation allowance noted  are more likely than not to be fully realized in corresponding future periods  and the company s net deferred tax asset has been stated appropriately as at december  in the event that management determines in the future that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be fully realized in the near term and prior to their expiration  the company will reassess the valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets and record any changes to income tax expense in the period determined 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following is a discussion of our primary market risk exposures at december  our policies to address these risks in were not materially different from the company believes that it is principally exposed to six types of market risk  interest rate risk  liquidity risk  foreign currency risk  credit risk  equity risk and inflation 

table of contents interest rate risk 
the company s primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
the company s fixed investment portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities 
as interest rates rise  the market value of our fixed income portfolio generally falls  and the converse is generally also true 
the company manages its interest rate risk through an asset liability matching strategy that involves the selection of investments with appropriate characteristics  such as duration  yield  currency and liquidity that are tailored to the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of our liabilities 
the target duration of the assets comprising the fixed income portfolio versus liabilities including reserves for losses and loss expenses was approximately years for the majority of our target duration for managed assets was years at december  a significant portion of the investment portfolio matures each quarter  allowing for reinvestment at current market rates 
as of december   assuming parallel shifts in interest rates  the impact of these interest rate shifts in basis points on the company s cash and fixed income portfolio of  million at december  would have been as follows interest rate shift in basis points december  us dollars in millions total market value market value change from base change in unrealized value another method used by the company to evaluate portfolio risk is value at risk var 
var is a probabilistic method of measuring the potential loss in portfolio value over a given time period and for a given distribution of historical returns 
portfolio risk  as measured by var  is affected by four primary risk factors asset concentration  asset volatility  asset correlation and systematic risk 
for a one year period over of the time  assuming the risks taken into account in the var model perform per their historical tendencies  the portfolio loss for this year period is expected to be less than or equal to at december  the company s other investments are exposed to interest rate risk 
to the extent that the securities underlying these investments have fixed maturities  fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these investments 
liquidity risk 
when financial markets experience a reduction in liquidity  our ability to conduct orderly investment transactions may be limited and may result in declines in fair values of the securities in our investment portfolio 
in addition  if we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of normal cash requirements which could include claims on a major catastrophe event in a period of market illiquidity  we may have difficulty selling our investments in a timely manner and may have to dispose of our investments for less than what may otherwise have been possible under other conditions 
foreign currency risk 
the company has made a significant investment in the capitalization of endurance uk  which is denominated in british sterling 
in addition  the company enters into reinsurance and insurance contracts for which it is obligated to pay losses in currencies other than us dollars 
the majority of our operating foreign currency assets and liabilities are denominated in euros  british sterling  canadian dollars  japanese yen and australian dollars 
the company may  from time to time  experience losses from fluctuations in the values of these and other non us currencies  which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations 
the company will attempt to manage its foreign currency risk by seeking to match its liabilities under insurance and reinsurance contracts that are payable in foreign currencies with investments that are denominated in such currencies 
the company purchases assets which are matched in currency to its case reserves for liabilities incurred in major currencies including us dollars  euros  british sterling  canadian dollars  japanese yen and australian dollars at the time such reserves are established 
the company has no currency hedges in place but may implement such strategies in the future 
as part of its asset liability matching strategy  the company may also consider the use of hedges when it becomes aware of probable significant losses that will be paid in non us dollar currencies 
for liabilities incurred in currencies other than those listed above  us dollars are converted to the currency of the loss at the time of claims payment 
as a result  the company may  from time to time  experience losses resulting from fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies 
assets and liabilities of foreign operations whose functional currency is not the us dollar are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses of such foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates during the period 
the effect of the translation adjustments for foreign operations is included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are revalued at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date with the resulting foreign exchange gains and losses included in earnings 
revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the prevailing exchange rate on the transaction date 

table of contents for the year ended december   of the company s gross premiums were written in currencies other than the us dollar 
the portions of our cash and cash equivalents  investments and reserves for loss and loss expenses denominated in non us currencies at december  were approximately  and  respectively 
as of december   the company s principal foreign currency exposures are denominated in euros and british sterling 
the company measures and manages its exposure in these currencies  among others  by monitoring its estimated gross and net asset positions 
in order to estimate such exposures  the company considers currency specific investments  cash and cash equivalents  premiums receivable  reserve for losses and loss expenses  and unearned premiums 
the total estimated gross and net asset balances denominated in euros were million and million  respectively 
the total estimated gross and net asset balances denominated in british sterling were million and million  respectively 
assuming all other variables are held constant and disregarding any tax effects  a change in the us dollar relative to these currencies could result in a million increase or decrease in the net assets held by the company at december  credit risk 
the company has exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed maturity investments  short term investments  preferred equity securities and alternative funds and high yield loan funds 
the company s risk management strategy and investment policy is to invest in debt instruments of high credit quality issuers and to limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to particular ratings categories and any one issuer 
the company attempts to limit its credit exposure by investing the fixed income portfolio primarily in investments rated a a or higher 
in addition  the company has limited its exposure to any single corporate issuer to or less of its fixed income portfolio 
the following table summarizes the fair value composition of the fixed investment portfolio  which includes fixed maturity investments  short term investments and preferred equity securities by investment ratings assigned by s p  moody s or other rating agencies and by contractual maturity at december  in some cases  where bonds are unrated  the rating of the issuer has been applied 
expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties

table of contents in addition  the company has exposure to credit risk as it relates to losses recoverable on paid and unpaid losses where the company has purchased reinsurance and retrocessional coverages 
the company relies on reinsurance within its insurance businesses in order to manage risk accumulations 
the company continues not to rely heavily on retrocessional reinsurance  but strategically purchases this coverage across the entire portfolio to reduce exposure to the risk of a severe catastrophe event or occurrence of multiple significant catastrophe events 
when reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance is purchased  the company requires its reinsurers to have strong financial strength ratings 
the company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors its concentration of credit risk on an ongoing basis 
the balance of losses recoverable at december  was million 
at december   the company had no allowance for estimated uncollectible losses recoverable 
the balance of losses recoverable at december  was distributed as follows based on the ratings of the reinsurers rating december  us dollars in thousands us government sponsored program a and above a a and below not rated total equity price risk 
certain of the company s alternative funds included in other investments are exposed to equity price risk 
to the extent that the securities underlying these investments are equity securities  fluctuations in the equity markets may have a direct impact on the market valuation of these investments 
the company estimates that it s other investments  comprised of investments in alternative funds and high yield loan funds  have a combined historical beta versus the s p index of approximately at december   calculated using a time series of monthly returns over a six year period 
beta measures the response of a portfolio s performance relative to a market return  where a beta of would indicate a similar return to the index 
given the historical beta for the company s other investments  a movement in the s p index would indicate an approximately or approximately million increase or decrease in the market value of the company s other investments at december  effects of inflation 
the effects of inflation could cause the cost of claims to rise in the future 
the potential exists  after a catastrophe loss  for the development of inflationary pressures in a local economy 
the company s estimates for losses and loss expenses include assumptions about future payments for settlement of claims and claims handling expenses  however to the extent inflation causes these costs to increase above the reserves established  the company will be required to increase the reserve for losses and loss expenses 
in addition  inflation could lead to higher interest rates causing the current unrealized gain position on the company s fixed income portfolio to decrease 
the current short duration of the company s fixed income portfolio has the potential to help reduce the negative effects of higher interest rates on the company s fixed income portfolio 
the company may also choose to hold its fixed income portfolio to maturity which would result in the unrealized gains largely amortizing through net investment income
