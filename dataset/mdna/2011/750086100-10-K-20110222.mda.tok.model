item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this document 
overview of our business rackspace hosting  inc is the world s leading specialist in the hosting and cloud computing industry 
our growth is the result of our commitment to serving our customers  known as fanatical support  and our singular focus on hosting and cloud computing 
we have been successful in attracting and retaining thousands of customers and in growing our business 
we are a pioneer in an emerging category  hybrid hosting  which provides for the combination of both traditional dedicated hosting and cloud computing 
we are committed to maintaining our service centric focus and will follow our vision to be considered one of the world s greatest service companies 
rackspace offers a portfolio of hosting services  including dedicated and cloud hosting 
the equipment required servers  routers  switches  firewalls  load balancers  cabinets  software  wiring  etc 
to deliver services is typically purchased and managed by us 
we sell our services to small and medium sized businesses as well as large enterprises 
during  of our net revenue was generated by our operations outside of the us  mainly from the us additionally  we operate a hong kong data center and a sales office 
our growth strategy includes  among other strategies  targeting international customers as we plan to expand our activities in continental europe and asia 
as we grow our business  we believe our operations are exposed to certain risks and uncertainties  which could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 
see the section entitled risk factors for further discussion of these risks 
how we earn revenue and measure growth our subscription based business model generates approximately of our revenue on a recurring basis 
our customers pay us a recurring fee based on the size and complexity of the it systems we manage and the level of service intensity we provide  pursuant to service agreements that typically provide for monthly payments 
our cloud business offers pay as you go services that are earned and recognized as the services are provided 
revenue is reduced by credits issued to customers  primarily for service interruptions  and also includes revenue related to customers who have cancelled their service 
net revenue for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively  representing year over year increases of in and in our revenue growth is primarily due to increased volume of services provided  both due to an increasing number of new customers and incremental services rendered to existing customers  as well as a broader suite of hosting services acquired through acquisitions and research and development activities 
growth in installed base is a metric we use to measure the growth of revenue derived only from our existing customer base 
to date  the majority of our recurring revenue has been earned as part of a subscription offering  however  the advent of virtual and cloud technology services provided on a utility basis are becoming more prevalent 
during  our recurring revenue has increased across our portfolio of services  but utility based service revenue has grown at a significantly faster rate than our subscription service revenue 
we believe that this trend will continue as the market changes the way it consumes computing resources and more companies begin to utilize cloud solutions 
as this portion of our revenue continues to increase at a higher rate than our subscription business  our current installed base growth metric may not capture this revenue growth effectively 
this is because historically  we have calculated installed base growth on our subscription business only 
as noted in our third quarter q  we have updated the growth in installed base metric calculation to reflect this change in our revenue 
the metric continues to be calculated as the difference between net upgrades and defection churn 
net upgrades measure the incremental monthly recurring revenue from customer upgrades less downgrades as a percentage of total monthly recurring revenue before customer credits 
churn measures the reduction of monthly revenue due to customer terminations as a percentage of total monthly recurring revenue before customer credits 
terminations typically result from customers who i no longer need hosting services  ii are unable to pay for hosting services  iii decide to provide their services in house  or iv switch to another hosting provider 
we measure net upgrades at the time a customer upgrades or downgrades services with us and we measure churn in the month we stop providing services to the customer 
net upgrades and churn are expressed as percentage increases decreases in the prior month s total monthly recurring revenue before customer credits 
prior to this year  the calculation included the impact of our utility business in the denominator of this calculation  but not the numerator 
however  beginning in the third quarter of  we have captured the full impact of our utility business by including it in both the denominator and the numerator 
see below for a comparative example of the two calculations a subscription net upgrades b utility net upgrades c prior month subscription and utility recurring revenue before credits  old method installed base growth calculation a c new method installed based growth calculation a b c the table below is a comparison of our installed base growth metric over the last three years using our old methodology compared to what it would have been if we had been using our new methodology year ended december  net upgrades monthly average new methodology old methodology difference churn monthly average new methodology old methodology difference growth in installed base monthly average new methodology old methodology difference our net revenue is denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the pound sterling  the euro  and the hong kong dollar 
changes in related currency exchange rates may affect our net revenue 
the decrease in net revenue due to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately million  or  in nature of our operating expenses our operating expense categories include cost of revenue  sales and marketing  general and administrative  and depreciation and amortization 
employee related costs have historically been the primary driver of our operating expenses and we expect this trend to continue 
employee related costs include items such as wages  commissions  non equity incentive compensation  vacation  benefits  and share based compensation 
employee non equity incentive compensation through our current non equity incentive plan  in effect since january   is dependent upon the financial results of the company in relation to a preset target level 
thus  favorable financial performance in comparison to the preset target level is partially offset by increased non equity incentive compensation expense 
if company achievement of the preset target results in a increase in the non equity incentive compensation percentage payout in a quarter  this would increase total non equity incentive compensation by approximately million on an after tax basis and increase net income by million in that quarter 
company achievement resulting in a decrease in the non equity incentive compensation percentage payout in a quarter would decrease total non equity incentive compensation by approximately million on an after tax basis and decrease net income by million in that quarter 
we had  and  employees as of december  and  respectively 
the year over year increases were primarily attributable to increases in our customer and data center support teams 
to maintain our service focus  our support teams have continued to grow with the growth of our business 
our headcount is expected to increase in as we continue to grow our business 
cost of revenue primarily consists of employee related costs of our customer support teams and data center employees  as well as the costs to operate our data centers 
the majority of our data center costs vary with the volume of services sold and include power  bandwidth  and rent  costs associated with licenses  and costs related to maintenance and the replacement of it equipment components 
our contracts with network operators for bandwidth capacity generally commit us to pay a monthly fee based on usage 
our data centers rely on local and regional utility companies as their primary source of power 
we have a fixed price power arrangement with the electricity provider of our grapevine  texas data center which expires in september and another arrangement that begins in october and expires in september we also entered into a fixed price contract for our slough uk data center  which expires in may we enter into contracts with software providers that allow us to provide licenses to our customers 
our arrangements with these software vendors are typically one to three years in length and we generally pay a fixed fee per license 
sales and marketing activities are directed toward both the acquisition of new customers and increasing our business with existing customers 
we pay commissions to our sales representatives generally upon execution of a service agreement 
sales and marketing expense also includes compensation to our channel partners 
marketing expenditures are intended to communicate the advantages of our services and to generate customer demand 
the majority of our marketing expenditures relate to lead generation through pay per click placements on major internet search engines 
general and administrative activities are comprised of employee related costs  professional fees  general corporate costs and overhead 
while we continue to invest in our administrative infrastructure and personnel to support our growth  our focus has been and continues to be on scaling these administrative costs 
depreciation and amortization expense includes amortization of leasehold improvements associated with our data centers and corporate facilities  as well as depreciation of our data center infrastructure and equipment 
amortization expense is also comprised of the amortization of our customer based intangible assets related to acquisitions  internally developed technology  and software licenses purchased from third party vendors 
our operating expenses are denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the pound sterling  the euro  and hong kong dollar 
changes in related currency exchange rates may affect our operating results 
the decrease in operating expenses  due to foreign currency fluctuations  was approximately million  or less than  in capital expenditures our capital expenditures primarily relate to customer gear  data center infrastructure  corporate office build outs  and internally developed software and other projects 
each category is defined below customer gear includes servers  firewalls  load balancers  cabinets  switches  backup libraries  storage arrays and drives and network cabling 
data center infrastructure includes generators  uninterruptible power supplies or ups  power distribution units  mechanical and electrical plants  chillers  raised floor and other building improvements 
corporate office build outs includes demolition  raised floor  chillers  furniture and general building improvements 
internally developed software and other includes salaries and payroll related costs of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of certain internal use software projects  and other projects that meet the criteria for capitalization 
in  we expended cash or entered into lease arrangements for the purchase of customer gear of million  data center infrastructure costs of million  corporate office build outs of million and million related to internally developed software and other capitalized projects 
in  we expect to have capital expenditures between million and million in the aggregate consisting of million to million for customer gear  million to million for data center infrastructure costs  million to million for office build outs  and million to million for capitalized software and other projects 
our data center infrastructure is built to accommodate future revenue growth 
while we try to minimize the amount of excess capacity  we consider appropriate lead times for these build outs  which requires us to build capacity ahead of actual revenue growth 
we also strive to align our investment in data center infrastructure with our revenue growth to keep utilization rates high 
we measure our utilization rate as the power being consumed by all electrical equipment relative to the total available capacity in our data centers excluding portions of the data center that have not been placed on line 
we pursue a modular build out strategy within our data centers that expands the operational footprint when needed 
from time to time  we will be required to make significant investments in new data centers or enter into long term facility leases to support expected growth beyond our ability to build out additional modules in existing facilities 
while many factors may influence our margins  in periods when we make large investments  margins may decrease 
such investments may be made in connection with data center and office expansion  as well as significant product and market development initiatives 
in may  we entered into an operating lease agreement with a subsidiary of dupont fabros technology to lease additional space at our chicago area data center 
this current strategy of entering into operating lease agreements for data center space reduces the capital investments required to increase our data center square footage 
disciplined use of capital and management of profitability we have achieved net income profitability since the first quarter of through focused management of capital and profitability 
we use the economic value added model eva  which was developed by stern stewart co  as a tool to help ensure our growth and capital investments create stockholder value 
virtually all capital expenditures are evaluated against this metric using a standard cost of capital 
eva is calculated for our product offerings to evaluate our profitability 
we are also very careful with our facility and data center expansion practices 
currently  we sell to businesses in more than countries 
unlike a colocation provider  we do not need to be located near our customers  allowing us to build or lease centralized  cost optimized facilities with teams of highly trained staff 
we strive to locate our regional facilities and data centers in lower cost locations  which reduces rent  power and labor costs 
we also focus on either leasing or building sections of data centers in increments so that capital expenditures are more closely matched to revenue growth 
we have made significant investments in cloud servers and cloud computing 
over the last several years  we have made acquisitions that have expanded our product set into cloud computing cloud hosting and cloud applications 
we will continue to identify and pursue strategic investments that have the potential to generate savings  enhance our competitive advantage  and increase our capabilities to serve customers 
we have achieved a critical mass that generates long term cost advantages 
like any service that moves from distributed to centralized production  scale is a factor in ensuring costs are low enough to drive mass adoption 
we are able to generate significant cost advantages based on our large installed customer base and growth profile 
we purchase large quantities of computing and data center assets  which allows us to negotiate higher volume pricing savings 
we are also able to make larger r d investments than many of our smaller competitors due to our ability to spread these costs across a larger base of revenue 
key metrics we carefully track several financial and operational metrics to monitor and control our growth  financial performance  and capacity 
our key metrics are structured around growth  profitability  capital efficiency  infrastructure capacity  and utilization

in the table above  we continue to define technical square feet of data center space as space that can be utilized to support it equipment 
with respect to square footage and utilization  for data centers that are not yet fully utilized our northern virginia and chicago area facilities we include square footage and power capacity based on the agreed upon schedule in the lease agreement 
for example  if the agreement has phases and we are in phase five  we include of the total square footage and power capacity called for in the lease agreement 
executive overview to aid in understanding our operating results for the periods covered by this report  we have provided an executive overview and a summary of the significant events that affected the most recent fiscal year 
these sections should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in item  our risk factors section included in item a of part i  and our audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in item of part ii of this report 
in we focused on accelerating the growth of our business while maintaining our profits and returns and focusing on the minimal use of cash to achieve our growth 
growth of our business 
our business grew in with net revenue growth year over year of million  or  to million compared to million in our increase in net revenue was primarily due to increased volume of services provided  due to both an increasing number of new customers and incremental services rendered to existing customers 
year over year revenue increases were for our managed hosting service and for our cloud computing service 
partially offsetting the revenue increase was the negative impact of a stronger us dollar relative to the pound sterling 
net revenue in would have been approximately million higher had the us dollar to the pound sterling exchange rate remained constant from the prior year 
our performance was the result of a combination of continued market demand for our services as well as our focused execution on our growth strategy 
as of december   we served over  customers running on over  servers within our data centers in the us  the us  and hong kong  which represented incremental increases in each category as compared to during  our monthly average churn rate was  which was unchanged from overall  our installed base continued to provide a portion of our growth in  growing at an average rate of in  compared to in and in  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  our churn rate was and installed base growth was 
our revenue growth has moved us into a new competitive landscape where our direct competitors are much larger and stronger financially 
we will continue to compete more directly with amazon  microsoft  ibm and google as hosting services become increasingly more virtualized 
accordingly  we have been making increased infrastructure investments to complement and leverage fanatical support  our principal differentiation from our competitors across our multiple service offerings 
our hosting services provide customers with a mission critical service and world class support and we believe this provides us with substantial growth opportunities 
we believe that by offering a higher service level agreement or extending our support to new technology platforms  our business becomes more capital efficient and our competitive advantage widens as our service capability increases 
scaling profits and returns 
while accelerating our revenue growth rate in  we have been able to improve our margins and returns 
we have achieved this by focusing on scaling expenses  and redirecting our spend to areas that provide more value  particularly in the area of sales and marketing 
in addition  initiatives have been put into place to more efficiently deploy our capital 
income from operations increased million  or  to million in  compared to million in operating income margin was in as compared to in adjusted ebitda increased million  or  to million in  compared to million in in addition  adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in see the following section on non gaap financial measures for a discussion of adjusted ebitda 
net income was million or per share on a diluted basis in  compared to net income of million  or per share on a diluted basis in net income margin was in as compared to in use of cash 
for the year ended december   we generated adjusted free cash flow of million 
see below for our discussion of non gaap financial measures 
during  except for the million repayment of our line of credit and cash paid for an acquisition of million  we were able to maintain a consistent level of cash and cash equivalents while growing our business by maintaining our disciplined use of capital 
our capital expenditures for were million  of which million was vendor financed  while our cash provided by operating activities was million 
in  we deployed an additional  servers  bringing our total servers to  an increase of 
as of december   we had million in cash deposits and million in money market funds 
we will continue to focus on these three areas in we expect to grow our business by broadening our portfolio of offerings in dedicated hosting and cloud computing  and making investments to further increase our service level capability and enhance our product portfolio 
we will continue our focus on expense management while improving our resource allocation to fund investment in strategic initiatives related to our data center expansion efforts and further growth in our portfolio of services  while striving to minimize our use of cash 
company highlights and developments product offerings we continue to invest in our cloud computing business and believe it is a critical part of our future success 
cloud computing  which consists of cloud hosting and cloud applications  continues to emerge as a new technology  with high adoption rates and investment  which is reflected in its high revenue growth rate 
the primary benefit of cloud computing is the value proposition that it provides for businesses 
it enables businesses to match costs directly to revenue to scale up and down on a real time basis as necessary 
we do not believe that cloud computing will replace traditional dedicated hosting offerings  but rather complement them  allowing customers to choose from a portfolio of offerings to meet need their business needs 
in july  we announced the launch of openstack  an open source cloud platform designed to foster the emergence of technology standards and cloud interoperability 
the project merges some of our core cloud code with the technology that powers the nasa nebula cloud platform 
openstack provides standardized cloud technology that will allow businesses to choose freely among service providers to run the same basic software 
in august  we launched cloud servers for windows 
this offering combines microsoft technology with utility pricing and on demand service  which allows windows users to deploy servers in minutes and pay only for what they use 
this offering expanded the number of potential customers for our cloud servers offering 
in december  we introduced two new products to better serve the enterprise market 
rackconnect offers customers a seamless integration of the rackspace cloud and dedicated hosting 
the new critical sites service level provides advanced monitoring for customers who rely on their websites and applications as mission critical components of their business 
with these products and others  rackspace gives businesses the power to choose compute platforms and service offerings to best meet their unique it needs 
in december  we began offering a new category in hosting managed cloud 
the first managed cloud offering is cloud servers with a managed service level  providing businesses with proactive monitoring  troubleshooting and guidance on how to leverage cloud computing 
with this offering  we are providing a higher service level to our cloud customers 
also in december  we announced the acquisition of cloudkick  a company that provides web applications for easy and efficient cloud server management 
cloudkick offers what amounts to a cockpit for navigating complex cloud environments  with all the information and controls in one panel to help developers and system administrators deploy and manage their cloud environments 
in january  we launched our cloud service in the uk data center infrastructure and growth during  we continued to add to our existing data center footprint both in the us and internationally to support our growth 
we added an approximate net  technical square feet of data center space

years ended december  and december  net revenue our net revenue was million during and million during  an increase of million  or 
the increase in net revenue was primarily due to increased volume of services provided  due to both an increasing number of new customers and incremental services rendered to existing customers 
partially offsetting the revenue increase was the negative impact of a stronger us dollar relative to the pound sterling in compared to net revenue for would have been approximately million higher had the us dollar to the pound sterling exchange rate remained constant from the prior year with a minimal impact to our margins as the majority of these customers are invoiced  and substantially all of our expenses associated with these customers are paid  by us or our subsidiaries in the functional currency of our company or our subsidiaries  respectively 
net revenue in was negatively impacted by two service interruptions  which resulted in a total of million in service credits 
there were no significant service interruptions in cost of revenue our cost of revenue was million during and million during  an increase of million  or 
of this increase  million was attributable to an increase in employee related expenses due to increases in salaries and benefits of million  share based compensation expense of million and non equity incentive compensation of million 
these increases were the result of the hiring of data center and support personnel to support our growth  equity awards granted in and higher percentage attainment against the preset target for non equity incentive compensation 
the cost increase was further attributable to an increase in data center costs of million related to bandwidth  power and rent  an increase in license costs of approximately million and an increase in consulting fees related to data center assessments and improvements of million 
impacting the million increase in license costs was a million reduction in related to the reversal of a previously recorded obligation relating to an unresolved contractual issue with a vendor 
during the fourth quarter of  we concluded that the obligation was no longer probable  and accordingly  we reversed the liability  which reduced cost of revenue 
the remaining increase was due to small increase in other cost of revenue expenses 
sales and marketing expenses our sales and marketing expenses were million during and million during  an increase of million  or 
of this increase  million was attributable to an increase in employee related expenses due to increases in salaries and benefits of million  commissions of million  share based compensation expense of million and non equity incentive compensation of million 
total compensation increased as a result of the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel and the impact of commissions associated with increased sales 
additionally  advertising and internet related marketing expenditures increased million and travel and other employee related expenses increased million 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses were million during and million during  an increase of million  or 
of this increase  million was attributable to employee related expenses due to increases in salaries and benefits of million  non equity incentive compensation of million  and share based compensation expense of million 
these increases are primarily due to additional headcount  higher percentage attainment against the preset target for non equity incentive compensation and equity awards granted in professional fees increased million primarily as a result of increased consulting expenses related to accounting and tax services  corporate strategy and internal system maintenance and improvements  and incremental software and maintenance costs of million 
travel and other employee related expenses such as recruiting fees and relocation increased million primarily due to the addition of several executive level positions and a general increase in hiring during additionally  property tax increased million due to the addition of data center facilities 
we also experienced an increase in merchant credit card fees of million due to higher volume of sales in the overall increase was partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense of million due to a positive change in customer payment patterns and increased cash collections 
the remaining variance was due to small changes in other general and administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense our depreciation and amortization expense was million during and million during  an increase of million  or 
this increase in depreciation and amortization expense was a direct result of an increase in property and equipment related to depreciable assets including increases in data center equipment and leasehold improvements due to data center build outs and internally developed and purchased software  as well as intangible assets acquired through acquisitions 
other income expense our interest expense was million during and million during  a decrease of million or 
this decrease was primarily due to the decreased level of indebtedness including capital leases 
interest expense was partially offset by capitalized interest of million during and million during interest and other income expense was million during and million during in  we recognized million in interest and other income  partially offset by foreign currency losses of million 
in  we recognized million of interest and other income  partially offset by foreign currency losses of million 
income taxes our effective tax rate remained constant with a rate of for and the differences between our effective tax rate and the us federal statutory rate of principally result from our geographical distribution of taxable income  research and development credits  contingency reserves for uncertain tax positions and permanent differences between the book and tax treatment of certain items
