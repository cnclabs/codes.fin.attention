overview we are a leading provider of enterprise cloud computing applications 
we provide a comprehensive customer and collaboration relationship management  or crm  service to businesses of all sizes and industries worldwide and we provide a technology platform for customers and developers to build and run business applications 
we were founded in february and began offering our enterprise crm application service in february since then  we have augmented our crm service with new editions and enhanced features 
we introduced our force 
com platform to customers and developers so they can build complementary applications to extend beyond crm 
in we introduced our appexchange directory of enterprise cloud computing applications that are integrated with our crm service and in most cases have been developed on our platform by third parties 
we also introduced chatter  a collaboration application for the enterprise to connect and share information securely and in real time 
our objective is to be the leading provider of crm application services and to be the leading platform on which our customers and partners build cloud computing applications 
key elements of our strategy include strengthening our existing crm applications and extending into new functional areas within crm  pursuing new customers and new territories aggressively  deepening relationships with our existing customer base  continuing to lead the industry transformation to the next phase of cloud computing  and encouraging the development of third party applications on our force 
com cloud computing platform 
we believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include our prospective customers willingness to migrate to an enterprise cloud computing application service  the performance and security of our service  our ability to continue to release  and gain customer acceptance of  new and improved features  our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies  successful customer adoption and utilization of our service  acceptance of our service in markets where we have few customers  the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and new competitors  the location of new data centers  third party developers willingness to develop applications on our platform  and general economic conditions which could affect our customers ability and willingness to purchase our application service  delay the customers purchasing decision or affect renewal rates 
to address these factors  we will need to  among other things  continue to add substantial numbers of paying subscriptions  upgrade our customers to fully featured versions such as our unlimited edition  provide high quality technical support to our customers and encourage the development of third party applications on our force 
com platform 
we plan to invest for future growth by expanding our data center capacity 
we also plan to hire additional personnel  particularly in direct sales  other customer related areas and research and development 
as part of our growth plans  we intend to continue focus on retaining customers at the time of renewal 

table of contents additionally  we plan to expand our domestic and international selling and marketing activities  continue to develop our brands  add additional distribution channels  increase our research and development activities to upgrade and extend our service offerings  develop new services and technologies and integrate acquired technologies  and add to our global infrastructure to support our growth 
we also regularly evaluate acquisitions or investment opportunities in complementary businesses  joint ventures  services and technologies in an effort to expand our service offerings 
we expect to continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future 
as such  we plan to reinvest a significant portion of our incremental revenue in fiscal to grow our business and continue our leadership role in the cloud computing industry 
we expect diluted earnings per share for fiscal to be significantly lower than diluted earnings per share for fiscal in november  we paid million in cash for approximately acres of undeveloped real estate in san francisco  california  including entitlements and improvements associated with the land  and perpetual parking rights in an existing garage  which we plan to develop into our global headquarters 
during fiscal we acquired several companies to strengthen and extend our service offerings 
we spent approximately million  net of cash acquired  for these companies 
in december  we established a japanese joint venture  kabushiki kaisha salesforce 
com salesforce japan  with sunbridge  inc  a japanese corporation  to assist with our sales efforts in japan 
during fiscal  we acquired sunbridge s and other shareholders interest in  and increased our ownership from percent to percent of  salesforce japan for cash payments totaling million 
in fiscal  we issued at par million convertible senior notes notes due on january  for trading days during the consecutive trading days ended january   our common stock traded at a price exceeding of the conversion price of per share applicable to the notes 
accordingly  based on the terms of the notes  the notes are convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending april  upon conversion of any notes  we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the notes and  with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the notes  shares of our common stock  cash  or a combination of both 
therefore  for the quarter ending april   the notes will be reclassified to a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
we expect marketing and sales costs  which were percent of our total revenues for fiscal and percent for the same period a year ago  to continue to represent a substantial portion of total revenues in the future as we seek to add and manage more paying subscribers  and build greater brand awareness 
fiscal year our fiscal year ends on january references to fiscal  for example  refer to the fiscal year ended january  sources of revenues we derive our revenues from two sources subscription revenues  which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing application service  and from customers purchasing additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fee  and related professional services and other revenues consisting primarily of training fees 
subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately percent of our total revenues during fiscal subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers of our service  varying service types of offering and the subscription price of our service 
we define a customer as a separate and distinct buying entity eg  a company  a distinct business unit of a large corporation  a partnership  etc 
that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing service 
we define a subscription as a unique user account purchased by a customer for use by its employees or other customer authorized users  and each such user is who we call a subscriber 
the number of paying subscriptions at each of our customers ranges from one to tens of thousands 
none of our customers accounted for more than percent of our revenues during fiscal   or 
table of contents subscription and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract 
the typical subscription and support term is to months  although terms range from one to months 
our subscription and support contracts are non cancelable  though customers typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform 
we generally invoice our customers in advance  in annual or quarterly installments  and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within days of invoice 
amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue  or in revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
in general  we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period 
professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation services and training 
our consulting and implementation engagements are typically billed on a time and materials basis 
we also offer a number of classes on implementing  using and administering our service that are billed on a per person  per class basis 
our typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within days of invoice 
we generally recognize revenue ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement date of each contract 
in determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues  we consider a number of factors  which are described in critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition below 
as we introduce new service offerings  we may not be able to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value for these elements of our sales arrangements 
as a result  when the professional services are sold together with subscription services that do not have objective and reliable evidence of fair value  the professional services fees cannot be accounted for separately  and the entire arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
in such situations  we recognize the entire arrangement fee ratably over the term of the subscription contract 
approximately percent of our total deferred revenue as of january  and respectively  related to deferred professional services revenue 
at the start of fiscal we will be adopting the provisions of asu adopting this provision will change our accounting for multiple element arrangements  see recent accounting pronouncement 
seasonal nature of deferred revenue and accounts receivable deferred revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service 
over percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service 
we generally invoice our customers in either quarterly or annual cycles  with a disproportionate weighting towards annual billings in the fourth quarter  primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns 
additionally  our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business 
the year on year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new business is causing the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new and existing customers to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings 

table of contents accordingly  the sequential quarterly changes in accounts receivable and the related deferred revenue during the first three quarters of our fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of the billing activity that occurs in the fourth quarter 
in thousands april  july  october  january  fiscal accounts receivable  net deferred revenue  current and noncurrent april  july  october  january  fiscal accounts receivable  net deferred revenue  current and noncurrent april  july  october  january  fiscal accounts receivable  net deferred revenue  current and noncurrent cost of revenues and operating expenses cost of revenues 
cost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service and providing support  the costs of data center capacity  depreciation or operating lease expense associated with computer equipment  allocated overhead and amortization expense associated with capitalized software related to our application service and acquired technology 
we allocate overhead such as rent and occupancy charges based on headcount 
employee benefit costs and taxes are allocated based upon a percentage of total compensation expense 
as such  general overhead expenses are reflected in each cost of revenue and operating expense category 
cost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee related costs associated with these services  including stock based expenses  the cost of subcontractors and allocated overhead 
the cost of providing professional services is significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than for our enterprise cloud computing subscription service due to the direct labor costs and costs of subcontractors 
we intend to continue to invest additional resources in our enterprise cloud computing application service 
for example  we plan to open additional data centers in the future 
additionally  as we acquire new businesses and technologies  the amortization expense associated with this activity will be included in cost of revenues 
the timing of these additional expenses will affect our cost of revenues  both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues  in the affected periods 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  including stock based expenses  the costs of our development and test data center and allocated overhead 
we continue to focus our research and development efforts on adding new features and services  integrating acquired technologies  increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our enterprise cloud computing application service 
our proprietary  scalable and secure multi tenant architecture enables us to provide all of our customers with a service based on a single version of our application 
as a result  we do not have to maintain multiple versions  which enables us to have relatively lower research and development expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software companies 
we expect that in the future  research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we upgrade and extend our service offerings  develop new technologies and integrate acquired businesses and technologies 

table of contents marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses are our largest cost and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  including stock based expenses  for our sales and marketing staff  including commissions  payments to partners  marketing programs and allocated overhead 
marketing programs consist of advertising  events  corporate communications and brand building and product marketing activities 
we plan to continue to invest in marketing and sales by expanding our domestic and international selling and marketing activities  building brand awareness and sponsoring additional marketing events 
we expect that in the future  marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars and continue to be our largest cost 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses  including stock based expenses  for finance and accounting  human resources and management information systems personnel  legal costs  professional fees  other corporate expenses and allocated overhead 
we expect that in the future  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we invest in our infrastructure and we incur additional employee related costs  professional fees and insurance costs related to the growth of our business and international expansion 
we expect general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues to remain flat for the next several quarters 
stock based expenses 
our cost of revenues and operating expenses include stock based expenses related to option and stock awards to employees and non employee directors 
we recognize our share based payments as an expense in the statement of operations based on their fair values and vesting periods 
if our grant activity remains consistent and our stock price increases in the future  stock based expenses will rise 
these charges have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase as we hire more employees and seek to retain existing employees 
joint venture in december  we established a japanese joint venture  kabushiki kaisha salesforce 
com salesforce japan  with sunbridge  inc  a japanese corporation  to assist us with our sales efforts in japan 
during fiscal  we acquired sunbridge s and other shareholders interest in  and increased our ownership from percent to percent of  salesforce japan 
as a result of our purchase of the shares held by sunbridge  the joint venture agreement terminated according to its terms 
as we did not obtain percent ownership until the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a noncontrolling interest in our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal  which reflects the interest that we did not control in salesforce japan s results in fiscal and all prior years presented 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note to our consolidated financial statements  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service has been provided to the customer  the collection of our fees is reasonably assured  and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
our arrangements do not contain general rights of return 

table of contents we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract terms beginning on the commencement dates of each contract 
support revenues from customers who purchase our premium support offerings are recognized similarly over the term of the support contract 
as part of their subscription agreements  customers generally benefit from new features and functionality with each release at no additional cost 
in situations where we have contractually committed to an individual customer specific technology  we defer all of the revenue for that customer until the technology is delivered and accepted 
once delivery occurs  we then recognize the revenue over the remaining contract term 
consulting services and training revenues are accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable 
when accounted for separately  revenues are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts  and when the milestones are achieved and accepted by the customer for fixed price contracts 
the majority of our consulting service contracts are on a time and material basis 
training revenues are recognized after the services are performed 
for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  such as an arrangement that includes subscription  premium support  consulting or training services  we allocate the total amount the customer will pay to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  as determined by the price of the undelivered items when sold separately 
in determining whether the consulting services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues  we consider the following factors for each consulting agreement availability of the consulting services from other vendors  whether objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered elements  the nature of the consulting services  the timing of when the consulting contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date  and the contractual dependence of the subscription service on the customer s satisfaction with the consulting work 
if a consulting arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting  we recognize the consulting revenue ratably over the remaining term of the subscription contract 
additionally  in these situations we defer the direct costs of the consulting arrangement and amortize those costs over the same time period as the consulting revenue is recognized 
the deferred cost on our consolidated balance sheet totaled million at january  and million at january  such amounts are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets  net 
accounting for deferred commissions 
we defer commission payments to our direct sales force 
the commissions are deferred and amortized to sales expense over the non cancelable terms of the related subscription contracts with our customers  which are typically to months 
the commission payments  which are paid in full the month after the customer s service commences  are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements 
the deferred commission amounts are recoverable through the future revenue streams under the non cancelable customer contracts 
we believe this is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely related to the revenue from the non cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized 
during fiscal  we deferred million of commission expenditures and we amortized million to sales expense 
during the same period a year ago  we deferred million of commission expenditures and we amortized million to sales expense 
deferred commissions on our consolidated balance sheet totaled million at january  and million at january  business combinations 
we recognize separately from goodwill the fair value of assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
we use the best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date 
our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement 
as a result  during the measurement period  which may be up to one year from the acquisition date  we may record adjustments to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  with the corresponding offset to 
table of contents goodwill 
upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed  whichever comes first  any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date 
we reevaluate these items quarterly and record any adjustments to the preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period and we continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition 
subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance s or contingency s estimated value  changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations 
accounting for stock based awards 
we recognize the fair value of our stock awards on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award which is the vesting term of four years 
we recognized stock based expense of million  or percent of revenue  during fiscal the requirement to expense stock based awards will continue to materially reduce our reported results of operations 
as of january   we had an aggregate of million of stock compensation remaining to be amortized to expense over the remaining requisite service period of the underlying awards 
we currently expect this stock compensation balance to be amortized as follows million during fiscal  million during fiscal  million during fiscal  million during fiscal and million during fiscal these amounts reflect only outstanding stock awards as of january  and assume no forfeiture activity 
we expect to continue to issue share based awards to our employees in future periods  which will increase the stock compensation amortization in such future periods 
we recognize as an operating expense the payroll and social tax costs  as applicable by jurisdiction  when stock options are exercised 
the impact of stock based expense in the future is dependent upon  among other things  the timing of when we hire additional employees  the effect of long term incentive strategies involving stock awards in order to continue to attract and retain employees  the total number of stock awards granted  the fair value of the stock awards at the time of grant  changes in estimated forfeiture assumption rates and the tax benefit that we may or may not receive from stock based expenses 
additionally  we are required to use an option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards 
this determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards 
as of january   there were million restricted stock awards and units outstanding 
we plan to continue awarding restricted stock to our employees in the future 
the restricted stock  which upon vesting entitles the holder to one share of common stock for each restricted stock  has an exercise price of per share  which is equal to the par value of our common stock  and vest over years 
the fair value of the restricted stock is based on our closing stock price on the date of grant  and compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures  is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities for the tax effected temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the tax expense or benefit for unusual items  or certain adjustments to the valuation allowance are treated as discrete items in the interim period in which the events occur 
our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates  certain non deductible expenses as a result of acquisitions  the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  and changes in tax laws and accounting principles

the notes will mature on january   unless earlier converted 
as of january   the notes have not been repurchased or converted 
we also have not received any shares under the note hedges or delivered cash or shares under the warrants 
for trading days during the consecutive trading days ended january   our common stock traded at a price exceeding of the conversion price of per share applicable to the notes 
accordingly  the notes are convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending april  upon conversion of any notes  we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the notes and  with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal amount of the notes  shares of our common stock  cash  or a combination of both 
therefore  for the quarter ending april   the notes will be reclassified to a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet so long as the notes are convertible 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised primarily of corporate notes and obligations  us agency obligations  us treasury securities  mortgage backed securities  collateralized mortgage obligations  time deposits  money market mutual funds  government obligations and municipal securities

this potential repayment of the notes is not reflected in the timing of the payments due by period above 
we have a contractual obligation to begin construction on the undeveloped land by september if we do not commence construction by this date we will be subject to certain penalties due to a third party 
these potential penalties are not reflected in the timing of the payments due by period above 
we do not believe we will be subject to these penalties 
our lease agreements provide us with the option to renew 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements as we expand our operations 
purchase orders are not included in the table above 
our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
the contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum services to be used  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above 
the timing of tax settlements are not included in the table above 
we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax settlements 
for further information  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we recorded liabilities related to uncertain tax positions 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over the next months

recent accounting pronouncement in september  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued update no 
 revenue recognition topic  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu 
it updates the existing multiple element revenue arrangements guidance currently included under asc the revised guidance primarily provides two significant changes eliminates the need for objective and reliable evidence of the fair value for the undelivered element in order for a delivered item to be treated as a separate unit of accounting  and requires the use of the relative selling price method to allocate the entire arrangement consideration 
in addition  the guidance also expands the disclosure requirements for revenue recognition 
asu will be effective for us at the start of fiscal we believe the future impact of this new accounting pronouncement will not be material to our consolidated net income 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the euro  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  swiss franc  singapore dollar  japanese yen and australian dollar 
we seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts 
any gain or loss from settling these contracts is offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures 
in accordance with our policy  the hedging contracts we enter into have maturities of less than three months 
additionally  by policy  we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate sensitivity we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling billion at january  this amount was invested primarily in money market funds  time deposits  corporate notes and bonds  government securities and other debt securities with credit ratings of at least single a or better 
the cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes 
our investments are made for capital preservation purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however because we classify our debt securities as available for sale  no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other than temporary 
our fixed income portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of basis points at january  could result in a million market value reduction or increase of the same amount 
this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur 
fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates gains or losses on the carrying value are recorded in other comprehensive income  and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities 
at january   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling billion 
the fixed income portfolio was also subject to interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates of basis points would have resulted in market value changes of million 
market risk and market interest risk in january  we issued at par value million of convertible senior notes due the notes 
holders may convert their notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances 
upon conversion  we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amount of the notes 
amounts in excess of the principal amount  if any  may be paid in cash or stock at our option 
concurrent with the issuance of the notes  we entered into separate note hedging transactions and the sale of warrants 
these separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the notes 
as of february  the notes are convertible at the option of the noteholder 
for trading days during the consecutive trading days ended january   our common stock traded at a price exceeding of the conversion price of per share applicable to the notes 
accordingly  the notes are convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending april  upon conversion of any notes  we will deliver cash up to the principal amount of the notes and  with respect to any excess conversion value greater than the principal 
table of contents amount of the notes  shares of our common stock  cash  or a combination of both 
therefore  as of february   the notes will be reclassified to a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet so long as the notes are convertible 
the notes have a fixed annual interest rate of and therefore  we do not have economic interest rate exposure on the notes 
however  the value of the notes are exposed to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of our fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
in addition  the fair value of our notes is affected by our stock price 
the carrying value of our notes was million as of january  this represents the liability component of the million principal balance as of january  the total estimated fair value of our notes at january  was million and the fair value was determined based on the closing trading price per of the notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal  which was 
we have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in public and privately held companies  many of which are in the development stage 
when our ownership interests are less than percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence  we account for the minority equity investments using the cost method of accounting 
otherwise  we account for the investments using the equity method of accounting 
at january   the fair value of these investments was million
