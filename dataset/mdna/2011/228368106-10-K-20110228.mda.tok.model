executive overview the company s principal areas of focus include improving segment income and cash flow from operations 
segment income is a non gaap measure defined by the company as gross profit less selling and administrative expenses 
see note x to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding segment income 
improving segment income is primarily dependent on the company s ability to increase revenues and manage costs 
key strategies for expanding sales include targeting geographic markets with strong growth potential  such as asia  south america  eastern europe and the middle east  improving selling prices in certain product lines and developing innovative packaging products using proprietary technology 
the company s cost control efforts focus on improving operating efficiencies and managing material and labor costs  including pension and other benefit costs 
the company continues to consider opportunities to reduce leverage 
the company s total debt of  at december  increased from  at december   primarily due to new accounting guidance related to securitizations as described in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
the company considers possible transactions such as acquisitions which  if effected  may increase the company s indebtedness or involve the issuance of company securities  dispositions  refinancings or the repurchase of company common stock pursuant to board approved repurchase authorizations under which was available at december  
such transactions would be subject to compliance with the company s debt agreements 
the cost of aluminum and steel  the primary raw materials used to manufacture the company s products  has been subject to significant volatility in recent years and certain steel supply contracts provide for prices that fluctuate or adjust rather than provide a fixed price during a one year period 
the company attempts to pass through these costs to its customers through provisions that adjust the selling prices to certain customers based on changes in the market price of the applicable raw material  or through surcharges where no such provision exists 
the company recognizes revenue related to selling price increases when all of the revenue recognition criteria has been met 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to fully recover from its customers the impact of any increased aluminum and steel costs 
in addition  decreased costs resulting from raw material price fluctuations may be passed through to customers  which would in turn result in decreases to the company s revenue

the company expects that the liabilities will be paid out over the period of remediation for the applicable sites  which in some cases may exceed ten years 
although the company believes its reserves are adequate  there can be no assurance that the ultimate payments will not exceed the amount of the company s reserves and will not have a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flow 
any possible loss or range of potential loss that may be incurred in excess of the recorded reserves cannot be estimated 
the potential impact on the company s operations of climate change and potential future climate change regulation in the jurisdictions in which the company operates is highly uncertain

inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company over the past three years and the company does not expect it to have a significant impact on the results of operations or financial condition in the foreseeable future 

table of contents crown holdings  inc critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require that management make numerous estimates and assumptions 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions  impacting the reported results of operations and financial position of the company 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described under note a to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies  however  are considered to be critical in that i they are most important to the depiction of the company s financial condition and results of operations and ii their application requires management s most subjective judgment in making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
asbestos liabilities the company s potential liability for asbestos cases is highly uncertain due to the difficulty of forecasting many factors  including the level of future claims  the rate of receipt of claims  the jurisdiction in which claims are filed  the nature of future claims including the seriousness of alleged disease  whether claimants allege first exposure to asbestos before or during and the alleged link to crown cork  the terms of settlements of other defendants with asbestos related liabilities  the bankruptcy filings of other defendants which may result in additional claims and higher settlement demands for non bankrupt defendants  potential liabilities for claims filed after the company s ten year projection period and the effect of state asbestos legislation including the validity and applicability of the pennsylvania legislation to non pennsylvania jurisdictions  where the substantial majority of the company s asbestos cases are filed 
see note k to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the provision for asbestos related costs 
at the end of each quarter  the company considers whether there have been any material developments that would cause it to update its asbestos liability accrual calculations 
absent any significant developments in the asbestos litigation environment in general or with respect to the company specifically  the company updates its accrual calculations in the fourth quarter of each year 
the company s asbestos liability accrual is calculated as the sum of its outstanding and expected future claims  multiplied by the five year average settlement cost of those claims  plus estimated legal fees 
claims in those states where the company s liability is limited by statute and claims alleging first exposure to asbestos after are included in the number of outstanding claims but are assumed to have no value 
the expected number of claims and the average settlement cost per claim are calculated using projections based on the actual data for the most recent five years 
the five year average settlement cost per claim was   and  for  and  respectively 
the average settlement cost per claim increased due to a higher percentage of claims in crown cork s settlement pool for claims alleging serious disease primarily mesothelioma and other malignancies during the most recent five year period 
of the approximately  claims outstanding at the end of  and approximately  and  respectively  relate to claims alleging serious diseases 
of the approximately  claims related to claimants alleging first exposure to asbestos before or during that were filed in states that have not enacted asbestos legislation and were outstanding at the end of  and approximately  and  respectively  relate to claims alleging serious diseases 
because claims are not submitted or settled evenly throughout the year  it is difficult to predict at any time during the year whether the number of claims or average settlement cost over the five year period ending december of such year will increase compared to the prior five year period 
the company s asbestos liability is calculated using a ten year projection and the company therefore expects to incur an annual charge to account for projected claims in the new tenth year 
in  the company recorded a charge of compared to in and in the charge of included to increase the company s accrual for asbestos related costs in texas as described in note k to the consolidated financial statements as well as the impact of including an additional year in the ten year projection 
table of contents crown holdings  inc combined with the increased settlement costs per claim  which were partially offset by a projected decrease in the number of future claims 
during  and  respectively  the company made asbestos related payments of  and if the recent trend of settling a higher percentage of claims alleging serious disease primarily mesothelioma and other malignancies  which are settled for higher amounts continues  average settlement costs per claim are likely to increase and  if not offset by a reduction in overall claims and settlements  the company may record additional charges in the future 
a change in either the average cost per claim or the number of projected claims would increase or decrease the estimated liability at december  by for the following ten year period 
a increase or decrease in these two factors at the same time would increase or decrease the estimated liability at december  by and  respectively  for the following ten year period 
goodwill impairment the company performs a goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter of each year or when facts and circumstances indicate goodwill may be impaired 
the impairment review involves a number of assumptions and judgments  including the calculation of fair value for the company s identified reporting units 
the company determines the estimated fair value for each reporting unit based on the average of the estimated fair values calculated using market values for comparable businesses and discounted cash flow projections 
the company uses an average of the two methods in estimating fair value because it believes they provide an equal probability of yielding an appropriate fair value for the reporting unit 
the company s estimates of future cash flows include assumptions concerning future operating performance and economic conditions and may differ from actual future cash flows 
under the first method of calculating estimated fair value  the company obtains publicly available trading multiples based on the enterprise value of companies in the packaging industry whose shares are publicly traded 
the company also reviews available information regarding the multiples used in recent transactions  if any  involving transfers of controlling interests in the packaging industry 
the appropriate multiple is applied to the forecasted ebitda a non gaap item defined by the company as net customer sales  less cost of products sold excluding depreciation and amortization  less selling and administrative expenses of the reporting unit to obtain an estimated fair value 
under the second method  fair value is calculated as the sum of the projected discounted cash flows of the reporting unit over the next five years and the terminal value at the end of those five years 
the projected cash flows generally include no growth assumption unless there has recently been a material change in the business or a material change is forecasted 
the discount rate used is based on the average weighted average cost of capital of companies in the packaging industry  which information is available through various sources 
the terminal value at the end of the five years is the product of the projected ebitda at the end of the five year period and the trading multiple 
the company used an ebitda multiple of times and a discount rate of in its review 
the assumed ebitda multiple was consistent with the times used in the discount rate in increased from the used in due to an increase in the weighted average cost of capital of companies in the packaging industry 
based upon consideration of the sensitivity of the assumptions made and methods used to determine fair value  industry trends and other relevant factors  the company did not have any reporting unit at the end of whose fair value did not materially exceed its carrying value except for its european aerosols reporting unit 
as of december   the estimated fair value of the european aerosols reporting unit was higher than its carrying value  and the reporting unit had of goodwill 
the fair value of the european aerosols reporting unit was estimated using the methods and assumptions described above 
the maximum potential effect of weighting the two methods other than equally would have been to increase or decrease the estimated fair value at december  by less than as the two methods provided values that were within of each other 
assuming all other factors remain the same  a change in projected annual ebitda changes the excess of estimated fair value over carrying value by  a change of in the assumed ebitda multiple changes the excess of estimated fair value over carrying value by  and an increase in the discount rate from to changes the excess of estimated fair value over carrying value by the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as determined using projected discounted cash flows assumed that current year results were held constant 
if future operating results were to decline causing the estimated fair value to fall below its carrying value  it is possible that an impairment charge of up to could be recorded 

table of contents crown holdings  inc long lived assets impairment the company performs an impairment review of its long lived assets  primarily property  plant and equipment  when facts and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows 
any impairment loss is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value 
the company s estimates of future cash flows involve assumptions concerning future operating performance  economic conditions and technological changes that may affect the future useful lives of the assets 
these estimates may differ from actual cash flows or useful lives 
tax valuation allowance the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a portion of the tax assets will not be realized 
the estimate of the amount that will not be realized requires the use of assumptions concerning the company s future taxable income 
these estimates are projected through the life of the related deferred tax assets based on assumptions that management believes are reasonable 
the company considers all sources of taxable income in estimating its valuation allowances  including taxable income in any available carry back period  the reversal of taxable temporary differences  tax planning strategies  and taxable income expected to be generated in the future other than reversing temporary differences 
should the company change its estimate of the amount of its deferred tax assets that it would be able to realize  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease in tax expense in the period such a change in estimate was made 
the company s valuation allowances of at december  included in the us  in france  in canada  in belgium  in the netherlands  in asia and in poland 
as of december   the company had of remaining valuation allowance against its us deferred tax assets including for state tax loss carryforwards and for capital loss carryforwards 
the state tax loss carryforwards expire as follows in through  in through  and thereafter 
the capital loss carryforwards expire in and future realization of the company s of net us deferred tax assets will require approximately billion of aggregated us taxable income 
at december   the company s net deferred tax assets in france consist of of deferred tax assets  including of tax loss carryforwards that do not expire  of deferred tax liabilities and of valuation allowances 
the company is unable to conclude at this time that it is more likely than not that it will realize any additional deferred tax benefits in france  primarily due to a restructuring of the company s operations which will reduce its profits in france 
it is possible that the company may be required to increase this valuation allowance at some future time if its income projections are later revised downwards 
it is also possible that the company will release additional portions of its french valuation allowance in future periods if its income projections are revised upwards 
as of december   the company has a full valuation allowance of against its net deferred tax assets in canada 
the net deferred tax assets of include of tax loss carryforwards that expire in to the canadian operations remain in a three year cumulative loss position and had a significant loss in due to low operating margins and plant closing costs 
the company does not believe it has sufficient positive evidence at this time to release any of the valuation allowance in canada  but it is possible that some or all of its canadian valuation allowance will be reversed in the future if the results of operations improve 
during the third quarter of  the company released of valuation allowance for a belgian subsidiary based on projections of future taxable income 
the subsidiary generated positive income in and and is projecting positive income in future years sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets 
the deferred tax assets are primarily tax loss carryforwards that do not expire 
the company continues to maintain a valuation allowance of for deferred tax assets in a dormant entity in belgium that the company does not believe at this time it will be able to utilize

the subsidiary generated positive income in and and is projecting positive income in future years sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets 
the company continues to maintain a valuation allowance of for tax loss carryforwards that expire in and that the company does not believe at this time it will be able to utilize 
the remaining valuation allowances of in asia and in poland are also in entities where the company does not believe it has sufficient positive evidence at this time to release any of the valuation allowances  but it is possible some or all of the valuation allowances will be released in the future 
unrecognized tax positions the company recognizes the impact of a tax position if  in the company s opinion  it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of that position 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the determination of whether the impact should be recognized  and the measurement of the impact  can require significant judgment and the company s estimate may differ from actual settlement amounts 
see note w to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company s tax positions 
pension and postretirement benefits accounting for pensions and postretirement benefit plans requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding numerous factors  including discount rates  rates of return on plan assets  compensation increases  health care cost increases  mortality and employee turnover 
actual results may differ from the company s actuarial assumptions  which may have an impact on the amount of reported expense or liability for pensions or postretirement benefits 
the rate of return assumptions are reviewed at each measurement date based on the pension plans investment policies  current asset allocations and an analysis of the historical returns of the capital markets 
the us plan s assumed asset rate of return of was based on a calculation using underlying assumed rates of return of for equity securities and alternative investments  and for debt securities and real estate 
an assumed rate of was used for equity securities and alternative investments based on the total return of the s p for the year period ended december  the company believes that the equity securities included in the s p are representative of the equity securities and alternative investments held by its us plan  and that years provides a sufficient time horizon as a basis for estimating future returns 
the company used a assumed return for debt securities  consistent with the us plan discount rate and the return on aa corporate bonds with duration equal to the plan s liabilities 
the underlying debt securities in the plan are primarily invested in various corporate and government agency securities and are benchmarked against returns on aa corporate bonds 
the uk plan s assumed asset rate of return of was based on a calculation using underlying assumed rates of return of for equity securities and alternative investments  and for debt securities and real estate 
equity securities in the uk plan as of december  were allocated approximately to us securities  to uk securities  to securities in european countries other than the uk  and to securities in other countries 
the assumed rate of for equity securities and alternative investments represents the weighted average year return of equity securities in these markets 
the company believes that the equity securities included in the related market indexes are representative of the equity securities and alternative investments held by its uk plan  and that years provides a sufficient time horizon as a basis for estimating future returns 
a change in the expected rates of return would change pension expense by approximately 
table of contents crown holdings  inc discount rates were selected using a method that matches projected payouts from the plans with zero coupon aa bond yield curves in the respective currencies 
the yield curve in the united states was constructed from the underlying bond price and yield data collected as of the plans measurement date and are represented by a series of annualized  individual discount rates with durations ranging from six months to thirty years 
each discount rate in the curve was derived from an equal weighting of the aa bond universe  apportioned into distinct maturity groups 
these individual discount rates were then converted into a single equivalent discount rate 
to assure that the resulting rates can be achieved by the plan  only bonds with sufficient capacity that satisfy certain criteria and are expected to remain available through the period of maturity of the plan benefits were used to develop the discount rate 
for the other countries independently published aa corporate bond yield curves were used 
a change in the discount rates from those used at december  would change pension expense by approximately and postretirement expense by approximately see note v to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on pension and postretirement benefit obligations and assumptions 
as of december   the company had pre tax unrecognized net losses in other comprehensive income of  related to its pension plans and related to its other postretirement benefit plans 
unrecognized gains and losses arise each year primarily due to changes in discount rates  differences in actual plan asset returns compared to expected returns  and changes in actuarial assumptions such as mortality 
for example  as disclosed in note v to the consolidated financial statements  the unrecognized net loss in the company s pension plans included a current year loss of consisting of a gain of due to actual asset returns of compared to expected returns of  offset by losses of primarily due to lower discount rates at the end of compared to unrecognized gains and losses are accumulated in other comprehensive income and the portion in each plan that exceeds of the greater of that plan s assets or projected benefit obligation is amortized to income over future periods 
the company s pension expense for the year ended december  included charges of for the amortization of unrecognized net losses  and the company estimates charges of in unrecognized net losses of  in the pension plans as of december  include in the uk defined benefit plan  in the u 
s defined benefit plan  in the canadian defined benefit plans  and in other plans 
amortizable losses in the uk plan are being recognized over years  representing the average expected life of inactive employees as over of the plan participants are inactive and the fund is closed to new participants 
amortizable losses in the us plan are being recognized over the average remaining service life of active participants of years 
amortizable losses in the canadian plans are being recognized over the average remaining service life of active participants of years 
an increase of in the number of years used to amortize unrecognized losses in each plan would decrease estimated charges for by a decrease of in the number of years would increase the estimated charge for by unrecognized net losses of in the company s other postretirement benefit plans as of december   primarily included in the us plans  with the amortizable portion being recognized over the average remaining service life of active participants of years 
the company s other postretirement benefits expense for the year ended december  included charges of for the amortization of unrecognized net losses  and the company estimates charges of in an increase of in the number of years used to amortize the unrecognized losses in each plan would decrease the estimated charge for by a decrease of in the number of years would increase the estimated charge for by stock based compensation calculation of the estimated fair value of stock option awards requires the use of assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables  including the expected term of the options  the annual risk free interest rate over the options expected term  the expected annual dividend yield on the underlying stock over the options expected term  and the expected stock price volatility over the options expected term 
the company generally bases its assumptions of option term and expected price volatility on historical data  but also considers other factors  such as vesting or expiration provisions in new awards that are inconsistent with past awards  that would make the historical data unreliable as a basis for future assumptions 
estimates of the fair value of stock options are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by employees who receive stock option awards  and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by the company
