you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which apply only as of the date of this annual report on form k 
except as required by law  we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements to reflect new information  events or circumstances after the date of this report  or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview we develop  produce  market and distribute premium beverages  including the following product lines and extensions jones soda  a premium carbonated soft drink  jones zilch tm  with zero calories and an extension of the jones soda product line  whoopass energy drink  an energy supplement drink  and whoopass zero energy drink  with zero sugar and an extension of the whoopass energy drink product line 
we sell and distribute our products primarily throughout the united states us and canada through our network of independent distributors  which we refer to as our direct store delivery dsd channel  and directly to national retail accounts  which we refer to as our direct to retail dtr channel 
additionally  in limited circumstances we sell concentrate for distribution or production of our products  which we refer to as our concentrate soda channel 
we do not directly manufacture our products but instead outsource the manufacturing process to third party contract manufacturers 
in december  we introduced our new packaging for our core glass bottles  the first time our packaging had been completely refreshed in almost years 
the new look is distinctly jones soda  updated with higher resolution printing designed to provide improved shelf presence for our brand 
we believe the new packaging highlights our portfolio of flavors while also delivering a cohesive  sustainable brand message to our consumers 
our products are sold in states in the us and nine provinces in canada  primarily in convenience stores  grocery stores  delicatessens  and sandwich shops  as well as through our national accounts with several large retailers 
we also sell various products on line  which we refer to as our interactive channel  including soda with customized labels  wearables  candy and other items 
our distribution landscape is evolving with over of our core case sales sold through our dsd channel in versus approximately in we are strategically building our international  national and regional retailer network by focusing on the distribution system that what will provide us the best top line driver for our products and optimize availability of our products 
we have focused our sales and marketing resources on the expansion and penetration of our products through our independent distributor network and national and regional retail accounts in our core markets throughout the us and canada 
in addition  we are expanding our international business outside of north america and have secured distribution with independent distributors in ireland  the united kingdom and australia 
during the second quarter of  walmart authorized us to retail our products in walmart s us based stores 
under the authorization  we have been allocated three shelf facings for a custom assorted pack of jones soda 
the pack includes two bottles each of our most popular flavors green apple  berry 
table of contents lemonade and cream soda 
this authorization provides us with the opportunity to expand our retail outlet distribution  making our core products more accessible to new and existing consumers 
our existing distribution network provides coverage to approximately of walmart s stores  and we are actively working with our distribution partners as well as expanding our distribution network to make our product available in all of walmart s approximately  us based stores 
as of the date of this report  we estimate that we are servicing over of walmart stores and plan to service of these stores before the first anniversary of this important authorization 
our business strategy is to increase sales by expanding distribution of our products in new and existing markets primarily within north america 
our business strategy focuses on expanding points of distribution of jones soda throughout the entire us in the grocery  mass and club channels  growing our convenience and gas c g distribution behind whoopass energy drink  expanding our sku offerings and space in the grocery stores where we are already present  developing innovative beverage brands that will allow us to capture share in the growing natural carbonated drink segment  and initiating relationships in additional international regions that index high on carbonated soft drink consumption 
in order to compete effectively in the beverage industry  we believe that we must convince independent distributors that jones soda and whoopass energy drink are leading brands in the premium soda and energy drink segments of the sparkling beverage category 
we believe our story is compelling as we perform well compared to our direct competitors in the premium soda segment in sales per point of distribution 
additionally  as a means of maintaining and expanding our distribution network  we introduce new products and product extensions  and when warranted  new brands 
during  we re launched our whoopass energy drink and have plans in to launch a new  more natural and lower calorie product in the natural sparkling beverage market 
although we believe that we will be able to continue to create competitive and relevant brands to satisfy consumers changing preferences  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so or that other companies will not be more successful in this regard over the long term 
we discontinued our jones organics tm and jones naturals brands in the first quarter of following the loss of dtr customers that accounted for a significant portion of our sales of those products and due to the costs of maintaining inventory for low volume products and our decision to transition out of underperforming product lines 
in addition  we determined during the fourth quarter of that we would begin transitioning out of underperforming product lines  jones c and jones gaba  to focus our sales and marketing resources on our core jones soda glass bottle business and our newly re launched whoopass energy drink 
in june  we entered into an equity line of credit arrangement equity line with glengrove small cap value  ltd glengrove  pursuant to which glengrove committed to purchase  upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the purchase agreement establishing the facility  up to million worth of shares of our common stock  subject to a maximum aggregate limit of  common shares 
the facility provided that we may  from time to time  over the month term of the facility and at our sole discretion  present glengrove with draw down notices to purchase our common stock at a price equal to the daily volume weighted average price of our common stock on each date during the draw down period on which shares are purchased  less a discount of 
during  we completed draw downs and sales under the facility of an aggregate of  shares for net proceeds of approximately million 
on february   we completed our final draw down and sale of  shares for net proceeds of approximately million 
we sold to glengrove a total of  shares  which is the maximum number of shares issuable under the terms of the equity line and the equity line by its terms automatically has terminated 
see notes and to the financial statements 

table of contents taking into account the net proceeds from our february draw down under the equity line  we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs at least into the first half of our current operating plan does not require us to obtain additional financing  however  this will depend on our ability to meet our sales volume goals and otherwise execute on our operating plan 
we believe it is imperative to meet these objectives and continue to expand our distribution network and increase sales volume in order to lessen our reliance on external financing in the future 
in the event we require additional financing to support our working capital needs  we believe we have various debt and equity financing alternatives available to us 
however  these alternatives may require significant cash payments for interest and other costs or could be highly dilutive to our existing shareholders 
we continue to monitor whether credit facilities may be available to us on acceptable terms 
there can be no assurance that any new debt or equity financing arrangement will be available to us when needed on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  there can be no assurance that these financing alternatives would provide us with sufficient funds to meet our long term capital requirements 
if necessary  we may explore strategic transactions in the best interest of the company and our shareholders  which may include  without limitation  public or private offerings of debt or equity financings  joint ventures with one or more strategic partners  strategic acquisitions and other strategic alternatives  but there can be no assurance that we will enter into any agreements or transactions the uncertainties relating to our ability to successfully execute our operating plan  combined with our inability to implement further meaningful cost containment measures that do not jeopardize our growth plans and the difficult financing environment  continue to raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern see liquidity and capital resources 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue for the year ended december   revenue was approximately million  a decrease of million  or from million in revenue for the year ended december  the decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to a decrease in total case sales compared to the prior year of to million cases  which included a decrease in cases sales through our dsd and dtr channels 
case sales through our dsd channel declined by  cases from levels and included a decrease of  cases due to the transitioning out of underperforming product lines  including jones c and jones gaba  as we focus our sales and marketing resources on our core jones soda glass bottle business and our newly re launched whoopass energy drink 
the balance of the decline in dsd case sales compared to is comprised primarily of a decrease in case sales of jones soda glass bottles and occurred primarily in the first half of the year 
we believe this was due to continued reduced demand resulting from the impact of the economic downturn in and on consumer spending levels  to inefficiencies in our distributor network as well as a lack of disciplined focus on our core product 
however  we believe that the decline in case sales has slowed as a result of our efforts  beginning in the latter part of  to reinforce and expand our distributor network by partnering with new distributors and replacing underperforming distributors in addition to the transition out of several of our product lines in the fourth quarter of as we focus on our jones soda glass bottle business and our newly re launched whoopass energy drink 
with respect to our dtr channel  the loss of significant dtr customers in early contributed to the decline of  case sales in that channel during compared to case sales of concentrate decreased to  cases  a decrease of  compared to as part of management s strategic refocus  we intend to continue to emphasize our higher margin core products  including our jones soda glass bottle business as well as our newly re launched whoopass energy drink  with less emphasis on our concentrate soda channel  which is a lower margin business for us 
however  we believe our efforts with respect to expanding our distribution network will contribute to our sales through our dsd and dtr channels in future periods 
for the year ended december   promotion allowances and slotting fees  which are a reduction to revenue  totaled million  a decrease of million  or  from million a year ago 
the decrease 
table of contents in promotion allowances and slotting fees was primarily attributable to a decrease in promotion allowances in our dtr channel and to a lesser extent  a decrease in our dsd channel due to pricing strategies that lowered the use of promotion allowances in exchange for lower delivered pricing 
this strategy was changed during the fourth quarter and as such  we anticipate an overall increase in our promotional allowance and slotting fee costs in gross profit year ended december  change dollars in thousands gross profit of revenue for the year ended december   gross profit increased by approximately  or  to million as compared to million in gross profit for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of lower gross profit in the prior year resulting from a million charge  consisting of a million write down of excess gaba inventory and a  impairment of equipment located at a co packer relating to our concentrate soda channel 
additionally  the reduction in promotion allowances and slotting fees  and a significant reduction in storage costs per case due to improved inventory management  contributed to the increase in gross profit 
offsetting the increase was the impact of a  write down of excess gaba in for the year ended december   gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to compared to for the year ended december  the change in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was primarily the result of the charges incurred in  which negatively impacted gross profit for that year as noted above 
specifically  the percentages reflect reductions of for and for due to the inventory write downs in each year as well as impairment charges for licensing revenue licensing revenue decreased  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december   and consisted primarily of our exclusive licensing arrangements with big sky brands for jones soda flavor booster hard candy 
we believe licensing revenue was down due to the negative impact on sales resulting from the economic downturn 
we do not expect licensing revenue to represent a material portion of our overall revenues in promotion and selling expenses promotion and selling expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million  a decrease of million  or  from million for the year ended december  promotion and selling expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to for the year ended december   from in the decrease in promotion and selling expenses was primarily due to a decrease in selling expenses year over year of million  to million  or of revenue 
this decrease in resulted primarily from the effects of decreases in sales personnel in conjunction with the strategic refocus and cost containment efforts taken during  which included reductions in workforce 
also contributing to the decrease in promotion and selling expenses was a million decrease in trade promotion and marketing expenses from million to million  or of revenue for  due in part to our cost containment efforts  including the reduction of agency fees and sponsorships 
we anticipate promotion and selling expenses to begin to increase in future quarters and plan to spend approximately million for marketing during the anticipated increase is due in part to the added sales and marketing personnel brought on during the third quarter of to support our strategy of securing and growing larger distributor and national retail accounts  as well as growing our jones soda glass bottle business  our newly re launched whoopass energy drink  and our planned launch in of a natural sparkling beverage 

table of contents general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of  or  compared to million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to for the year ended december  from in the same period of the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in professional fees and a reduction in salaries and benefits resulting from a decrease in headcount primarily as a result of the strategic refocus and cost containment efforts 
offsetting these decreases was an increase in bad debt expense due in part to adjustments in the prior year period that reduced the allowance for doubtful accounts 
income tax benefit expense  net provision for income taxes for the years ended december  and was a benefit of  and an expense of  respectively 
the tax provision relates primarily to the tax provision on income from our canadian operations and reflects a non recurring credit for due to a tax refund allowed 
no tax benefit is recorded for the loss in our us operations as we have recorded a full valuation allowance on our us net deferred tax assets 
we expect to continue to record a full valuation allowance on our us net deferred tax assets until we sustain an appropriate level of taxable income through improved us operations 
our effective tax rate is based on recurring factors  including the forecasted mix of income before taxes in various jurisdictions  estimated permanent differences and the recording of a full valuation allowance on our us net deferred tax assets 
net loss net loss for the year ended december  decreased to million from a net loss of million for the year ended december  this was primarily due to a decrease in promotion and selling expense of million and general and administrative expense of  as a result of decreases in salaries and benefits primarily due to headcount reductions and our cost containment efforts as well as a tax refund allowed resulting from our canadian operations 
also contributing to the reduction in net loss was an increase in gross profit of  for the reasons outlined above under gross profit 
liquidity and capital resources as of december  and  we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and million  respectively  and working capital of million and million  respectively 
cash used in operations during fiscal years and totaled million and million  respectively 
cash provided by operations was  during the quarter ended december  our cash flows vary throughout the year based on seasonality 
we traditionally use more cash in the first half of the year as we build inventory to support our historically seasonally stronger shipping months of april through september  and expect cash used by operating activities to decrease in the second half of the year as we collect receivables generated during our stronger shipping months 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by investing activities totaled approximately  due primarily to redemption of the restricted certificate of deposit in conjunction with the repayment of the note payable we issued in to consolidate our capital leases into one promissory note for a lower interest rate 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by investing activities totaled approximately  due primarily to the sale of short term investments  partially offset by the purchase of the certificate of deposit required to secure our promissory note 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december   totaled approximately million  due to the proceeds from the draw downs on our equity line  offset by the repayment of the note payable 
this compares to net cash used by financing activities for the year ended december   which totaled approximately  due to the repayment of capital lease obligations offset by the proceeds from the note payable resulting from the consolidation of our capital leases into one promissory note for a lower interest rate 
we incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december   which included charges of  relating to a further write down of our gaba inventory see note in item of this report 
our accumulated deficit increased to million as of december  compared to the prior year s deficit of million 

table of contents in june  we entered into an equity line of credit arrangement equity line with glengrove small cap value  ltd glengrove  pursuant to which glengrove committed to purchase  upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the purchase agreement establishing the facility  up to million worth of shares of our common stock  subject to a maximum aggregate limit of  common shares 
the facility provided that we may  from time to time  over the month term of the facility and at our sole discretion  present glengrove with draw down notices to purchase our common stock at a price equal to the daily volume weighted average price of our common stock on each date during the draw down period on which shares are purchased  less a discount of 
during  we completed draw downs and sales under the facility of an aggregate of  shares for net proceeds of approximately million 
on february   we completed our final draw down and sale of  shares for net proceeds of approximately million 
we sold to glengrove a total of  shares  which is the maximum number of shares issuable under the terms of the equity line and the equity line by its terms automatically has terminated 
see notes and 
taking into account the net proceeds through our final draw down under the equity line in february  we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs at least into the first half of this will depend  however  on our ability to successfully execute our operating plan  which is based on our realigned higher margin product portfolio  including our jones soda glass bottle business and our newly re launched whoopass energy drink 
during  we discontinued four of our product lines to focus our efforts in the sparkling beverage category 
to that end  we plan to introduce a new product offering during to enhance our sparkling beverage portfolio  however  the introduction of new products involves a number of risks  and there can be no assurance that we will achieve the sales levels we expect or that justify the additional costs associated with new product introductions 
we also plan to continue our efforts to reinforce and expand our distributor network by partnering with new distributors and replacing underperforming distributors 
it is critical that we meet our volume projections and continue to increase volume going forward  as our operating plan already reflects prior significant general and administrative cost containment measures  leaving us little room for further reductions in such costs 
our operating plan factors in the use of cash to meet our contractual obligations 
a substantial portion of these contractual obligations consists of obligations to purchase raw materials  including sugar and glass under our supply agreements 
we enter into these supply agreements in order to fix the cost of these key raw materials  which we expect will be used in the ordinary course of our business 
our contractual obligations also relate to payments for sponsorships  but it is our intent to renegotiate key remaining sponsorship arrangements to reduce our payment obligations 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to modify these sponsorship arrangements in a timely manner to reduce our payment obligations or make any other changes to the terms of our sponsorship arrangements 
we intend to continually monitor and adjust our business plan as necessary to respond to developments in our business  our markets and the broader economy 
our current operating plan does not require us to obtain additional financing  however  this will depend on our ability to meet our sales volume goals and otherwise execute on our operating plan 
we believe it is imperative to meet these objectives and continue to expand our distribution network and increase sales volume in order to lessen our reliance on external financing in the future 
in the event we require additional financing to support our working capital needs  we believe we have various debt and equity financing alternatives available to us 
however  these alternatives may require significant cash payments for interest and other costs or could be highly dilutive to our existing shareholders 
we continue to monitor whether credit facilities may be available to us on acceptable terms 
there can be no assurance that any new debt or equity financing arrangement will be available to us when needed on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  there can be no assurance that these financing alternatives would provide us with sufficient funds to meet our long term capital requirements 
if necessary  we may explore strategic transactions in the best interest of the company and our shareholders  which may include  without limitation  public or private offerings of debt or equity financings  joint ventures with one or more strategic partners  strategic acquisitions and other strategic alternatives  but there can be no assurance that we will enter into any agreements or transactions 
the uncertainties relating to our ability to successfully execute our operating plan  combined with our inability to implement further meaningful cost containment measures that do not jeopardize our growth plans and the difficult financing environment  continue to raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue
