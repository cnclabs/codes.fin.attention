business operations evaluation and reengineering after the disposition of our pharmacy business  we began an ongoing evaluation of our sleep related business operations in order to generate significant organic revenue growth  expand operating margins  improve and accelerate cash flow  and increase net income and shareholder value 

table of contents significant organic revenue growth 
management believes that we can achieve significant organic revenue growth by pursuing the following initiatives independent sleep care centers 
set specific volume goals by month in for each of our facilities 
we are designing and implementing an incentive pay structure for our sales force to reward them for achieving and surpassing the volume goals 
furthermore  we will enhance our existing monitoring process to enable management to follow volume by location on a daily  weekly and monthly basis to facilitate meeting our volume goals 
we are evaluating and will subsequently reengineer our scheduling process in order to schedule patients faster  minimize no shows and last minute cancellations  maximize operating efficiencies by improving tech to patient ratio and maximizing the use of our existing capacity 
we feel our reengineered process will increase the rate at which we convert positively diagnosed sleep study patients to therapy services and increase the rate at which we convert therapy service patients to re supply patients which builds our recurring revenue patient base 
hospital sleep diagnostic program management agreements 
we continue to identify new hospital based sleep labs and execute management agreements with the facilities that have existing diagnostic sleep operations 
we believe that working with facilities that have existing operations ensures that the agreements will be immediately accretive to our earnings 
we have set specific volume goals by month in for each of our management agreements for we are designing and implementing an incentive pay structure for our sales force to reward them for achieving and surpassing volume goals 
in addition  we plan to make joint presentations with hospital administration to hospital s physician staff delineating the benefits of the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders particularly obstructive sleep apnea 
we believe this will increase the rate at which we convert positively diagnosed sleep study patients to therapy services and increase the rate at which we convert therapy service patients to re supply patients which builds our recurring revenue patient base 
expand operating margins  increase net income and enhance shareholder value 
management believes that we can achieve expansion of our operating margins  improved net income and increased shareholder value by pursuing the following initiatives evaluate  minimize and leverage our existing corporate and support services 
we plan to evaluate and right size our finance  billing  scheduling  human resources  re supply service  sales and marketing departments in terms of structure  staffing requirements  facilities operated and information system integration 
we will also evaluate and reengineer our purchasing function to ensure that we are paying the best prices available for our medical and business supplies and services 
we plan to consider entering into outsourcing partnerships for certain functions re supply fulfillment and shipping  group purchasing organization 
improve and accelerate cash flow 
management believes that we can achieve improved and accelerated cash flow by pursuing the following initiatives network migration 
during  we will complete our migration from an out of network provider to an in network provider in all locations where it makes sense from a cost benefit analysis perspective 
we believe that we will more than offset the lower allowable amounts offered to in network providers by  lowering our cost to collect  lowering our bad debt write offs and accelerating our payment timeframes by being in network 
additionally  we believe that by lowering patient out of pocket costs by being in network and we will also be able to increase the volume of patients serviced at our independent sleep care centers 

table of contents reengineer scheduling and billing functions 
we will evaluate and will subsequently reengineer our scheduling and billing functions to reduce the time between when our service or supplies are provided and when we receive payment for those services and supplies the billing cycle 
this will be accomplished by enhancing our scheduling process to ensure that all required documentation is gathered prior to services being rendered or supplies being shipped thereby reducing significantly the number of claims that have to be reworked by the billing department prior to initial billing or after denial by the payor 
we will also review and update our policy related to the payment of patient deductible and coinsurance amounts prior to services being rendered or supplies being shipped in order to significantly condense the billing cycle and reduce our bad debt write offs 
acquisitions growth strategy we plan to grow our business via organic growth related to our independent sleep care centers  hospital sleep diagnostic programs both increased volumes related to existing management agreements and the execution of new management agreements  therapy services and recurring re supply fulfillment

texas labs june nocturna sleep center  llc nocturna   april roll up of noncontrolling interests in certain sms sleep centers minority all of the acquisitions were asset purchases  other than the acquisitions of somnicare  inc  somnitech  inc  avastra easter sleep centers and nocturna sleep center  llc  which were entity purchases 
acquisition goodwill in connection with the acquisitions during  our sms operating segment recorded goodwill of  and intangible assets of  the intangible assets of  recorded during consisted of customer relationships with indefinite lives of  customer relationships of  amortizable over to years  trademarks having a value of  amortizable over years  covenants not to compete of  amortizable over the period of the covenants not to compete  to years and payor contracts of  amortizable over years 

table of contents goodwill and other indefinite lived assets are not amortized  but are subject to impairment reviews annually  or more frequent if necessary 
we are required to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the related operating unit below its carrying amount 
these circumstances may include without limitation a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  unanticipated competition  or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
in evaluating whether goodwill is impaired  we must compare the fair value of the operating unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the operating units carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value of the operating unit will be estimated using a combination of the income  or discounted cash flows  approach and the market approach that utilize comparable companies data 
if the carrying amount of the operating unit ie  sleep center exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of an operating unit to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of the operating unit goodwill  the fair value of the operating unit will be allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that operating unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of an operating unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities will be the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss will be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
based on our i assessment of current and expected future economic conditions  ii trends  strategies and forecasted cash flows at each business unit and iii assumptions similar to those that market participants would make in valuing our business units  we determined that the carrying value of goodwill related to our sleep centers located in oklahoma  nevada and texas exceeded their fair value 
in addition  we determined the carrying value our intangible assets associated with eastern and certain other intangibles exceeded their fair value 
accordingly  we recorded a noncash impairment charge  in december  of million and million  respectively  on goodwill and other intangible assets 
our evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets completed during december resulted in no impairment losses

as a result  an impairment charge of  was recorded 
net other expense represents interest expense on borrowings reduced by interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents

financial commitments we do not have any material capital commitments during the next months  but we do have contractual commitments of approximately million for payments on our indebtedness and for operating lease payments 
included in this amount is million related to the classification of our credit facility as current for financial statement purposes 
although we have not entered into any definitive arrangements for obtaining additional capital resources  either through long term lending arrangements or equity offering  we continue to explore various capital resource alternatives to replace our long term bank indebtedness 
our future commitments under contractual obligations by expected maturity date at december  are as follows years total long term debt operating leases operating leases  discontinued operations includes principal and interest obligations 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we had no material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of regulation s k as of december  and critical accounting policies the consolidated condensed financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and include amounts based on management s prudent judgments and estimates 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
to the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results  however  adjustments to the statement of earnings and corresponding balance sheet accounts would be necessary 
these adjustments would be made in future statements 
some of the more significant estimates include revenue recognition  allowance for contractual adjustments and doubtful accounts  and goodwill and intangible asset impairment 
we use the following methods to determine our estimates revenue recognition sleep center services and product sales are recognized in the period in which services and related products are provided to customers and are recorded at net realizable amounts estimated to be paid by customers and third party payers 
insurance benefits are assigned to us and  accordingly  we bill on behalf of our customers 
for the business acquired from somnicare  inc and somnitech  inc collectively referred to as somni in  we estimate the net realizable amount based primarily on the contracted rates stated in the contracts we have with various payors 
we have used this method to determine the net revenue for the somni business since the date of the acquisition and do not anticipate any future changes to this process 
in our historic business  the business has been predominantly out of network and as a result  we have not had contract rates to use for determining net revenue for a majority of our payors 
for this portion of the business  we perform a quarterly analysis of actual reimbursement from each third party payor for the most recent months 
we conduct this analysis for each of our operating locations separately to ensure differences in payment rates from various markets are identified in the analysis 
in the analysis  we calculate the percentage actually paid by each third party payor of the amount billed to determine the applicable amount of net revenue for each payor at each location 
the key assumption in this process is that actual reimbursement history is a reasonable predictor of the future out of network reimbursement for each payor at each facility 
historically  we consistently used this process to estimate net revenue at the time of service other than a change in fiscal to using months of payment history 
prior to that time  we used nine months of payment history for its quarterly analysis 
although the impact on the calculation was negligible  we determined a month review eliminates potential seasonal fluctuations and provides a broader sample of payments for the calculation 
during the fourth quarter of  we migrated much of our historic sleep diagnostic business to an in network position 
as a result  commencing with the fourth quarter of  the revenue from our historic sleep diagnostic business was determined using the process utilized in the somni business 
for our therapy business  we expect to transition to this same process in the first or second quarter of this change in process and assumptions for our historic business is not expected to have a material impact on future operating results 
for certain sleep therapy and other equipment sales  reimbursement from third party payers occurs over a period of time  typically to months 
we recognize revenue on these sales as payments are earned over the payment period stipulated by the third party payor 
we have established an allowance to account for contractual adjustments that result from differences between the amount billed and the expected realizable amount 
actual adjustments that result from differences between the payment amount received and the expected realizable amount are recorded against the allowance for contractual adjustments and are typically identified and ultimately recorded at the point of cash application or when otherwise determined pursuant to our collection procedures 
revenues are reported net of such adjustments 

table of contents due to the nature of the healthcare industry and the reimbursement environment in which we operate  certain estimates are required to record net revenues and accounts receivable at their net realizable values at the time products or services are provided 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available  which could have a material impact on our operating results and cash flows in subsequent periods 
specifically  the complexity of many third party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payers may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded 
the patient and their third party insurance provider typically share in the payment for our products and services 
the amount patients are responsible for includes co payments  deductibles  and amounts not covered due to the provider being out of network 
due to uncertainties surrounding deductible levels and the number of out of network patients  we are not certain of the full amount of patient responsibility at the time of service 
starting in  we implemented a process to estimate amounts due from patients prior to service and increase collection of those amounts prior to service 
remaining amounts due from patients are then billed following completion of service 
cost of services and sales cost of services includes technician labor required to perform sleep diagnostics  fees associated with interpreting the results of the sleep study and disposable supplies used in providing sleep diagnostics 
cost of sales includes the acquisition cost of sleep therapy products sold 
costs of services are recorded in the time period the related service is provided 
cost of sales is recorded in the same time period that the related revenue is recognized 
if the sale is paid for over a specified period  the product cost associated with that sale is recognized over that same period 
if the product is paid for in one period  the cost of sale is recorded in the period the product was sold 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for contractual adjustments and doubtful accounts 
the majority of our accounts receivable is due from private insurance carriers  medicare and medicaid and other third party payors  as well as from customers under co insurance and deductible provisions 
third party reimbursement is a complicated process that involves submission of claims to multiple payers  each having its own claims requirements 
adding to this complexity  a significant portion of our business has historically been out of network with several payors  which means we do not have defined contracted reimbursement rates with these payors 
for this reason  our systems reported revenue at a higher gross billed amount  which we adjusted to an expected net amount based on historic payments 
this process continues in our historic sleep therapy business  but was changed in the fourth quarter of for our historic sleep diagnostic business 
as a result  the reserve for contractual allowance has been reduced as our systems now report a larger portion of our business at estimated net contract rates 
as we continue to move more of our business to in network contracting  the level of reserve related to contractual allowances is expected to decrease 
in some cases  the ultimate collection of accounts receivable subsequent to the service dates may not be known for several months 
as these accounts age  the risk of collection increases and the resulting reserves for bad debt expense to reflect this longer payment cycle 
we have established an allowance to account for contractual adjustments that result from differences between the amounts billed to customers and third party payers and the expected realizable amounts 
the percentage and amounts used to record the allowance for doubtful accounts are supported by various methods including current and historical cash collections  contractual adjustments  and aging of accounts receivable 
we offer payment plans to patients for amounts due from them for the sales and services we provide 
for patients with a balance of or less  we allow a maximum of six months for the patient to pay the amount due 
for patients with a balance over  we allow a maximum of months to pay the full amount due 
the minimum monthly payment amount for both plans is per month 

table of contents accounts are written off as bad debt using a specific identification method 
for amounts due from patients  we utilize a collections process that includes distributing monthly account statements 
for patients that are not on a payment plan  collection efforts including collection letters and collection calls begin at days from the initial statement 
if the patient is on a payment program  these efforts begin days after the patient fails to make a planned payment 
for our diagnostic patients  we submit patient receivables to an outside collection agency if the patient has failed to pay days following service or  if the patient is on a payment plan  they have failed to make two consecutive payments 
for our therapy patients  patient receivables are submitted to an outside collection agency if payment has not been received between and days following service depending on the service provided and circumstances of the receivable or  if the patient is on a payment plan  they have failed to make two consecutive payments 
it is our policy to write off as bad debt all patient receivables at the time they are submitted to an outside collection agency 
if funds are recovered by our collection agency  the amounts previously written off are reversed as a recovery of bad debt 
for amounts due from third party payors  it is our policy to write off an account receivable to bad debt based on the specific circumstances related to that claim resulting in a determination that there is no further recourse for collection of a denied claim from the denying payor 
included in accounts receivable are earned but unbilled receivables 
unbilled accounts receivable represent charges for services delivered to customers for which invoices have not yet been generated by the billing system 
prior to the delivery of services or equipment and supplies to customers  we perform certain certification and approval procedures to ensure collection is reasonably assured and that unbilled accounts receivable is recorded at net amounts expected to be paid by customers and third party payers 
billing delays  ranging from several weeks to several months  can occur due to delays in obtaining certain required payer specific documentation from internal and external sources  interim transactions occurring between cycle billing dates established for each customer within the billing system and new sleep centers awaiting assignment of new provider enrollment identification numbers 
in the event that a third party payer does not accept the claim for payment  the customer is ultimately responsible 
a summary of the days sales outstanding dso and management s expectations for the years ended december  and follows actual expected actual expected sleep diagnostic business to to sleep therapy business to to the primary reason for the decrease in expected dso for sleep therapy business from to days at december  to to days at december  is the change in accounting method during for equipment sales that are paid for over period of time see change in accounting method below 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired business 
goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment reviews  or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate there may be an impairment of goodwill 
intangible assets other than goodwill which include customer relationships  customer files  covenants not to compete  trademarks and payor contracts are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
the remaining lives range from three to fifteen years 
we evaluate the recoverability of identifiable intangible asset whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an intangible asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
change in accounting method on january   we elected to change our method of revenue recognition for sleep therapy equipment sales that are paid for over time rental equipment to recognize the revenue for rental equipment over the life of the rental period which typically ranges from to months 
prior to the business acquisitions made in the rd quarter of  we recognized the total amount of revenue for entire rental equipment period at the inception of the rental period with an offsetting entry for estimated returns 
the entities that were acquired in recorded revenue for rental equipment consistent with method being adopted 
recording revenue for rental equipment over the life of the rental period will provide more accurate interim information as this method relies less on estimates than the previous method in which potential rental returns had to be estimated 
we have determined that it is impracticable to determine the cumulative effect of applying this change retrospectively because historical transactional level records are no longer available in a manner that would allow for the appropriate calculations for the historical periods presented 
as a result  we will apply the change in revenue recognition for rental equipment on a prospective basis 
as a result of the accounting change  our accumulated deficit increased  as of january   from  as originally reported  to 
table of contents material weakness internal controls over financial reporting during the sale of substantially all of the assets of apothecaryrx  we incurred significant charges related to the accounts receivable and inventory balances at apothecaryrx 
in addition  we noted additional control deficiencies that in aggregate with the material special charges incurred at our subsidiary apothecaryrx have caused us to conclude that we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting 
a material weakness is a deficiency  or a combination of control deficiencies  in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
although the accounts receivable trends and the inventory physical counts related to the apothecaryrx throughout prior periods did not generate unusual results or cause us to question the validity of the accounts to receivable or inventory balances  we feel that the significant charges recorded as a result of adjusting the inventory and accounts receivable amounts to their net realizable value subsequent to the sale of the apothecaryrx represent a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting 
since the operations of apothecaryrx were sold  no remediation efforts are needed related to those specific control deficiencies 
however  we are evaluating the circumstances and potential changes to entity wide controls to address the other identified control deficiencies 
recently adopted and recently issued accounting guidance adopted guidance effective january   we adopted changes issued by the fasb on january   for a scope clarification to the fasb s previously issued guidance on accounting for noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
these changes clarify the accounting and reporting guidance for noncontrolling interests and changes in ownership interests of a consolidated subsidiary 
an entity is required to deconsolidate a subsidiary when the entity ceases to have a controlling financial interest in the subsidiary 
upon deconsolidation of a subsidiary  an entity recognizes a gain or loss on the transaction and measures any retained investment in the subsidiary at fair value 
the gain or loss includes any gain or loss associated with the difference between the fair value of the retained investment in the subsidiary and its carrying amount at the date the subsidiary is deconsolidated 
in contrast  an entity is required to account for a decrease in its ownership interest of a subsidiary that does not result in a change of control of the subsidiary as an equity transaction 
the adoption of these changes had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
effective january   we adopted changes issued by the fasb on january   to disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
specifically  the changes require a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers 
the changes also clarify existing disclosure requirements related to how assets and liabilities should be grouped by class and valuation techniques used for recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
the adoption of these changes had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
effective january   we adopted changes issued by the fasb on february   to accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or available to be issued  otherwise known as subsequent events 
specifically  these changes clarified that an entity that is required to file or furnish its financial statements with the sec is not required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated 
other than the elimination of disclosing the date through which management has performed its evaluation for subsequent events  the adoption of these changes had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents issued guidance in july  the fasb issued changes to the required disclosures about the nature of the credit risk in an entity s financing receivables  how that risk is incorporated into the allowance for credit losses  and the reasons for any changes in the allowance 
disclosure is required to be disaggregated at the level at which an entity calculates its allowance for credit losses 
this change is effective us beginning june  the adoption of this accounting standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and disclosures 
in december  the fasb issued changes as to when a company should perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
the amendments in this change modify step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
the qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance  which requires that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the amendments in this change are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is not permitted 
this change is effective for us beginning january  and is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and disclosures 
in december  the fasb issued changes to the disclosure requirements for business combinations 
the changes require a public entity to disclose pro forma information for business combinations that occurred in the current reporting period 
the disclosures include pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined business combinations that occurred during the year had been as of the beginning of the annual reporting period 
if comparative financial statements are presented  the pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity for the comparable prior reporting period should be reported as though the acquisition date for all business combinations that occurred during the current year had been as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period 
the amendments in this update are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  effective for us beginning january  the adoption of this accounting standard is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows and disclosures 
in october  the fasb issued changes to revenue recognition for multiple deliverable arrangements 
these changes require separation of consideration received in such arrangements by establishing a selling price hierarchy not the same as fair value for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which will be based on available information in the following order vendor specific objective evidence  third party evidence  or estimated selling price  eliminate the residual method of allocation and require that the consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method  which allocates any discount in the arrangement to each deliverable on the basis of each deliverable s selling price  require that a vendor determine its best estimate of selling price in a manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis  and expand the disclosures related to multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
these changes become effective for us on january  management has determined that the adoption of these changes will not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements  as we do not currently have any such arrangements with our customers 
in january  the fasb issued changes to disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
specifically  the changes require a reporting entity to disclose  in the reconciliation of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level  separate information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements that is  on a gross basis rather than as one net number 
these changes become effective for us beginning january  other than the additional disclosure requirements  management has determined these changes will not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements
