item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
the electric utility segment consists of kcp l  a regulated utility  and  since the july   acquisition date of gmo  gmo s regulated utility operations which include its missouri public service and st 
joseph light power divisions 
electric utility serves approximately  customers located in western missouri and eastern kansas 
customers include approximately  residences   commercial firms  and  industrials  municipalities and other electric utilities 
electric utility s retail revenues averaged approximately of its total operating revenues over the last three years 
wholesale firm power  bulk power sales and miscellaneous electric revenues accounted for the remainder of electric utility s revenues 
electric utility is significantly impacted by seasonality with approximately one third of its retail revenues recorded in the third quarter 
electric utility s total electric revenues were of great plains energy s revenues over the last three years 
electric utility s net income accounted for approximately  and of great plains energy s income from continuing operations in  and  respectively 
regulation kcp l and gmo are regulated by the public service commission of the state of missouri mpsc  and kcp l is also regulated by the state corporation commission of the state of kansas kcc  with respect to retail rates  certain accounting matters  standards of service and  in certain cases  the issuance of securities  certification of facilities and service territories 
kcp l and gmo are also subject to regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  with respect to transmission  wholesale sales and rates  and other matters  the southwest power pool  inc spp and the north american electric reliability corporation nerc 
kcp l has a ownership interest in the wolf creek generating station wolf creek  which is subject to regulation by the nuclear regulatory commission nrc  with respect to licensing  operations and safety related requirements 
missouri and kansas jurisdictional retail revenues averaged approximately and  respectively  of electric utility s total retail revenues over the last two years 
see item md a  critical accounting policies section and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning regulatory matters 
competition missouri and kansas continue on the fully integrated utility model and no legislation authorizing retail choice has been introduced in missouri or kansas for several years 
as a result  electric utility does not compete with others to supply and deliver electricity in its franchised service territory  although other sources of energy can provide alternatives to electric utility customers 
if missouri or kansas were to pass and implement legislation authorizing or mandating retail choice  electric utility may no longer be able to apply regulated utility accounting principles to deregulated portions of its operations and may be required to write off certain regulatory assets and liabilities 
electric utility competes in the wholesale market to sell power in circumstances when the power it generates is not required for customers in its service territory 
in this regard  electric utility competes with owners of other generating stations and other power suppliers  principally utilities in its region  on the basis of availability and price 
electric utility s wholesale revenues averaged approximately of its total revenues over the last three years 
power supply electric utility has over  mws of generating capacity 
the projected peak summer demand for is  mw 
electric utility expects to meet its projected capacity requirements through with its generation assets and capacity purchases 
kcp l and gmo are members of the spp 
spp is a regional transmission organization rto mandated by ferc to ensure reliable supply of power  adequate transmission infrastructure and competitive wholesale prices of electricity 
as members of the spp  kcp l and gmo are required to maintain a capacity margin of at least of their projected peak summer demand 
this net positive supply of capacity and energy is maintained through their generation assets and capacity  power purchase agreements and peak demand reduction programs 
the capacity margin is designed to ensure the reliability of electric energy in the spp region in the event of operational failure of power generating units utilized by the members of the spp 
fuel the principal fuel sources for electric utility s electric generation are coal and nuclear fuel 
it is expected  with normal weather  that approximately of generation will come from these sources with the remainder provided by wind  natural gas and oil 
the actual and estimated fuel mix and delivered cost in cents per net kwh generated are in the following table 
fuel cost in cents per fuel mix a net kwh generated estimated actual estimated actual fuel coal nuclear natural gas and oil wind total generation a fuel mix based on percent of net mwhs generated 
gmo s retail rates and kcp l s retail rates in kansas contain certain fuel recovery mechanisms 
kcp l s missouri retail rates do not contain a fuel recovery mechanism 
to the extent the price of fuel or purchased power increases significantly  or if electric utility s lower cost units do not meet anticipated availability levels  great plains energy s net income may be adversely affected unless and until the increased cost could be reflected in kcp l s missouri retail rates 
coal during  electric utility s generating units  including jointly owned units  are projected to burn approximately million tons of coal 
kcp l and gmo have entered into coal purchase contracts with various suppliers in wyoming powder river basin prb  the nation principal supply region of low sulfur coal  and with local suppliers 
the coal to be provided under these contracts will satisfy approximately of the projected coal requirements for and approximately for  for and for the remainder of the coal requirements will be fulfilled through additional contracts or spot market purchases 
kcp l and gmo have entered into coal contracts over time at higher average prices affecting coal costs for and beyond 
kcp l and gmo have also entered into rail transportation contracts with various railroads to transport coal from the prb to their generating units 
the transportation services to be provided under these contracts will satisfy almost all of the projected transportation requirements for through kcp l and gmo entered into new rail transportation contracts at the end of to replace expiring long term contracts 
the contract rates adjust for changes in railroad costs 
rail transportation costs will be significantly higher under these new contracts 
nuclear fuel kcp l owns of wolf creek nuclear operating corporation wcnoc  the operating company for wolf creek  which is electric utility s only nuclear generating unit 
wolf creek purchases uranium and has it processed for use as fuel in its reactor 
this process involves conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride  enrichment of uranium hexafluoride and fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies 
the owners of wolf creek have on hand or under contract all of the uranium and conversion services needed to operate wolf creek through march and approximately after that date through march the owners also have under contract of the uranium enrichment and fabrication required to operate wolf creek through march see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding nuclear plant 
natural gas at december   kcp l had hedged approximately  and of its  and  respectively  projected natural gas usage for generation requirements to serve retail load and firm mwh sales 
at december   gmo had hedged approximately  and of its  and  respectively  expected on peak natural gas usage and natural gas equivalent purchased power 
purchased capacity and power kcp l and gmo have distinct rate and dispatching areas 
as a result  kcp l and gmo do not joint dispatch their respective generation 
gmo has long term purchased capacity and power agreements for approximately mw  which expire in through kcp l purchases power to meet its customers needs when it does not have sufficient available generation or when the cost of purchased power is less than kcp l s cost of generation or to satisfy firm power commitments 
management believes electric utility will be able to obtain enough power to meet its future demands due to the coordination of planning and operations in the spp region  however  price and availability of power purchases may be impacted during periods of high demand 
electric utility s purchased power  as a percentage of mwh requirements  averaged approximately  and for  and  respectively 
environmental matters see note to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding environmental matters 
kansas city power light company kcp l  headquartered in kansas city  missouri  is an integrated  regulated electric utility that engages in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity 
kcp l serves approximately  customers located in western missouri and eastern kansas 
customers include approximately  residences   commercial firms  and  industrials  municipalities and other electric utilities 
kcp l s retail revenues averaged approximately of its total operating revenues over the last three years 
wholesale firm power  bulk power sales and miscellaneous electric revenues accounted for the remainder of kcp l s revenues 
kcp l is significantly impacted by seasonality with approximately one third of its retail revenues recorded in the third quarter 
missouri and kansas jurisdictional retail revenues averaged approximately and  respectively  of total retail revenues over the last three years 
great plains energy and kcp l employees at december   great plains energy and kcp l had  employees  including  represented by three local unions of the international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew 
kcp l has labor agreements with local  representing clerical employees expires march   with local  representing transmission and distribution workers expires january   and with local  representing power plant workers expires february

risk factors actual results in future periods for great plains energy and kcp l could differ materially from historical results and the forward looking statements contained in this report 
the companies business is influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict  involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and are often beyond their control 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that the companies management currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect the companies 
this information  as well as the other information included in this report and in the other documents filed with the sec  should be carefully considered before making an investment in the securities of great plains energy or kcp l 
risk factors of kcp l are also risk factors of great plains energy 
utility regulatory risks complex utility regulation could adversely affect the companies results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
the companies are subject to  or affected by  extensive federal and state utility regulation  including by the mpsc  kcc  ferc  nrc  spp and nerc 
the companies must address in their business planning and management of operations the effects of existing and proposed laws and regulations and potential changes in the regulatory framework  including initiatives by federal and state legislatures  rtos  utility regulators and taxing authorities 
failure of the companies to obtain adequate rates or regulatory approvals in a timely manner  new or changed laws  regulations  standards  interpretations or other legal requirements  and increased compliance costs and potential non compliance consequences may materially affect the companies results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
certain of these risks are addressed in greater detail below 
the outcome of retail rate proceedings could have a material impact on the business and is largely outside the companies control 
the rates that kcp l and gmo are allowed to charge their customers are the single most important item influencing the companies results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
these rates are subject to the determination  in large part  of governmental entities outside of the companies control  including the mpsc  kcc and ferc 
the utility rate setting principle generally applicable to kcp l and gmo is that rates should provide a reasonable opportunity to recover expenses and investment prudently incurred to provide utility service plus a reasonable return on such investment 
various expenses incurred by kcp l and gmo have been excluded from rates by the mpsc and kcc in past rate cases as not being prudently incurred or not providing utility customer benefit  and there is a risk that certain expenses incurred in the future may not be recovered in rates 
the mpsc and kcc have also excluded from rates from time to time all or a portion of the capital cost of various facilities as not being prudently incurred or not being useful in providing utility service 
for example  kcc s november rate order for kcp l excluded a portion of the capital costs of the iatan no 
environment project and iatan no 
from kcp l s kansas jurisdictional rate base 
in march  kcp l entered into a collaboration agreement with the sierra club and the concerned citizens of platte county that provides for increases in kcp l s wind generation capacity and energy efficiency initiatives  reductions in certain emission permit levels at its iatan and lacygne generating stations  and projects to offset certain co emissions 
the wind generation  energy efficiency and emission permit reductions are conditioned on regulatory approval 
in addition to these commitments  as discussed in the environmental risks and financial risks sections below  the companies capital expenditures are expected to be substantial over the next several years for other environmental and other projects  and there is a risk that a portion of the capital costs could be excluded from rates in future rate cases 
the companies are also exposed to cost recovery shortfalls due to the inherent regulatory lag in the rate setting process  especially during periods of significant cost inflation or declining retail usage  as kcp l s and gmo s utility rates are generally based on historical information and are not subject to adjustment other than principally for fuel and purchased power for kcp l in kansas and for gmo between rate cases 
these and other factors may result in under recovery of costs  failure to earn the authorized return on investment  or both 
there are mandatory renewable energy standards in missouri and kansas 
there is the potential for future federal or state mandatory energy efficiency requirements 
kcp l agreed to implement various energy efficiency programs as part of the collaboration agreement and the comprehensive energy plan 
kcp l and gmo have implemented certain energy efficiency programs 
the companies currently recover energy efficiency program expenses on a deferred basis with no recovery mechanism for associated lost revenues 
the mpsc order approving the gmo acquisition provides that the transaction costs will not be recovered through utility rates  and that the missouri jurisdictional portion of transition costs will be eligible for recovery through utility rates only to the extent the costs are offset by benefits resulting from the acquisition 
these costs continue to be deferred until the mpsc authorizes their rate recovery 
the kcc order approving the gmo acquisition limited kcp l s recovery of transition costs through kansas rates to million over a five year period  starting in december failure to timely recover the full investment costs of capital projects  or the impact of renewable energy and energy efficiency programs  or other utility costs and expenses due to regulatory disallowances  regulatory lag or other factors could lead to lowered credit ratings  reduced access to capital markets  increased financing costs  lower flexibility due to constrained financial resources and increased collateral security requirements  or reductions or delays in planned capital expenditures 
in response to competitive  economic  political  legislative  public perception including  but not limited to  the companies environmental reputation and regulatory pressures  the companies may be subject to rate moratoriums  rate refunds  limits on rate increases  lower allowed returns on investment or rate reductions  including phase in plans designed to spread the impact of rate increases over an extended period of time for the benefit of customers 
regulatory requirements regarding utility operations may increase costs and may expose the companies to compliance penalties or adverse rate consequences 
the nrc extensively regulates nuclear power plants  including wolf creek 
the ferc  nerc and spp have implemented and enforce an extensive set of transmission system reliability  cyber security and critical infrastructure protection standards that apply to public utilities  including kcp l and gmo 
the mpsc and kcc have the authority to implement utility operational standards and requirements  such as vegetation management standards  facilities inspection requirements and quality of service standards  and kcp l agreed to quality of service standards in kansas in connection with the gmo acquisition 
in addition  the companies are also subject to health  safety and other requirements enacted by the occupational safety and health administration  the department of transportation  the department of labor and other federal and state agencies 
the costs of existing  new or modified regulations  standards and other requirements could have an adverse effect on the companies results of operations  financial position and cash flows as a result of increased operations or maintenance and capital expenditures for new facilities or to repair or improve existing facilities 
in addition  failure to meet quality of service  reliability  cyber security  critical infrastructure protection  operational or other standards and requirements could expose the companies to penalties  additional compliance costs  or adverse rate consequences 
environmental risks the companies are subject to current and potential environmental requirements and the incurrence of environmental liabilities  any or all of which may adversely affect their business and financial results 
the companies are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental laws  regulations and permit requirements relating to air and water quality  waste management and disposal  natural resources and health and safety 
in addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations and remediation costs for historical and pre existing conditions  these laws and regulations authorize the imposition of substantial penalties for noncompliance  including fines  injunctive relief and other sanctions 
there is also a risk that new environmental laws and regulations  new judicial interpretations of environmental laws and regulations  or the requirements in new or renewed environmental permits could adversely affect the companies operations 
in addition  there is also a risk of lawsuits brought by third parties alleging violations of environmental commitments or requirements  creation of a public nuisance or other matters  and seeking injunctions or monetary or other damages and certain federal courts have held that state and local governments and private parties have standing to bring climate change tort suits seeking company specific emission reductions and damages 
environmental permits are subject to periodic renewal  which may result in more stringent permit conditions and limits 
new facilities  or modifications of existing facilities  may require new environmental permits or amendments to existing permits 
delays in the environmental permitting process  public opposition and challenges  denials of permit applications  limits or conditions imposed in permits and the associated uncertainty may materially adversely affect the cost and timing of the projects  and thus materially adversely affect the companies results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
kcp l and gmo would seek recovery of capital costs and expenses for environmental compliance and remediation through rate increases  however  there can be no assurance that such rate increases would be granted 
as discussed above  kcp l and gmo may be subject to material adverse rate treatment in response to competitive  economic  political  legislative  public perception of the companies environmental reputation and regulatory pressures 
the costs of compliance or noncompliance with these environmental requirements  or remediation costs  or adverse outcomes of lawsuits  or failure to timely recover environmental costs  could have a material adverse effect on the companies results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
certain of these matters are discussed in more detail below 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding certain significant environmental matters 
air and climate change the companies believe it is likely that additional federal or relevant regional  state or local laws or regulations could be enacted to address global climate change 
at the international level  while the united states is not a current party to the kyoto protocol  it has agreed to undertake certain voluntary actions under the non binding copenhagen accord and pursuant to subsequent international discussions relating to climate change  including the establishment of a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
international agreements legally binding on the united states may be reached in the future 
such laws or regulations could require the control or reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases  such as co  which are created in the combustion of fossil fuels 
these requirements could include  among other things  taxes or fees on fossil fuels or emissions  cap and trade programs  and clean or renewable energy standards 
the companies current generation capacity is primarily coal fired  and is estimated to produce about one ton of co per mwh  or about million and million tons per year for great plains energy and kcp l  respectively 
missouri law requires at least of the electricity provided by certain utilities  including kcp l and gmo  to come from renewable resources by  increasing to by kansas law requires certain utilities  including kcp l  to have renewable energy generation capacity equal to at least of their three year average kansas peak retail demand by  increasing to by and by management believes that national renewable energy standards are also likely 
the timing  provisions and impact of such requirements  including the cost to obtain and install new equipment to achieve compliance  cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
such requirements could have a significant financial and operational impact on the companies 
the environmental protection agency epa has enacted various regulations regarding the reporting and permitting of greenhouse gases  and has proposed other permitting regulations  under the existing clean air act 
these existing and proposed rules establish new thresholds for greenhouse gas emissions  defining when clean air act permits under the new source performance standards  new source review and title v operating permits programs would be required for new or existing industrial facilities and when the installation of best available control technology would be required 
most of the companies generating facilities would be affected by these existing and proposed rules 
additional federal and or state legislation or regulation respecting greenhouse gas emissions may be proposed or enacted in the near future 
further  pursuant to the collaboration agreement  kcp l agreed to pursue a set of initiatives including energy efficiency  additional wind generation  lower emission permit levels at its iatan and lacygne stations and other initiatives designed to offset co emissions 
requirements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may cause the companies to incur significant costs relating to their ongoing operations through additional environmental control equipment  retiring and replacing existing generation  or selecting more costly generation alternatives  to procure emission allowance credits  or due to the imposition of taxes  fees or other governmental charges as a result of such emissions 
rules issued by the epa regarding emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants  nox  so and particulates are also in a state of flux 
such rules have been overturned by the courts and remanded to the epa to be revised consistent with the court orders 
the epa is expected to develop proposed standards in  based on maximum achievable control technology mact  for mercury and potentially other hazardous air pollutant emissions 
in addition  the epa has notified kcp l that mact determinations and schedules of compliance are required for kcp l s iatan no 
and hawthorn no 
generating units 
the missouri and kansas state environmental agencies have submitted to the epa their determinations that the kansas city area is an ozone nonattainment area  and must submit by implementation plans outlining how the area will meet the standards 
additionally  the epa has proposed to strengthen the national ambient air quality standard naaqs for ozone and has strengthened the naaqs for so the companies current estimates of capital expenditures exclusive of allowance for funds used during construction afudc and property taxes to comply with the currently effective clean air interstate rule cair and with the best available retrofit technology bart rule is approximately billion 
if cair is replaced by the proposed transport rule  the companies do not expect the required capital expenditures to exceed that amount 
however  it is unknown what requirements and standards will be imposed in the future and when the companies may have to comply  the effects of the mact determinations and schedules of compliance  or what costs may ultimately be required 
water the clean water act and associated regulations enacted by the epa form a comprehensive program to preserve water quality 
all of the companies generating facilities  and certain of their other facilities  are subject to the clean water act 
previously issued epa regulations regarding protection of aquatic life from being killed or injured by cooling water intake structures have been suspended  and the epa is engaged in further rulemaking on this matter 
at this time  the companies are unable to predict how the epa will respond or how that response will impact the companies operations 
kcp l holds a permit from the missouri department of natural resources mdnr authorizing kcp l to  among other things  withdraw water from the missouri river for cooling purposes and return the heated water to the missouri river 
kcp l has applied for a renewal of this permit and the epa has submitted an interim objection letter regarding the allowable amount of heat that can be contained in the returned water 
until this matter is resolved  kcp l continues to operate under its current permit 
kcp l cannot predict the outcome of this matter  however  while less significant outcomes are possible  this matter may require kcp l to reduce its generation at hawthorn station  install cooling towers or both  any of which could have a significant adverse impact on kcp l 
the outcome could also affect the terms of water permit renewals at kcp l s iatan station and at gmo s sibley and lake road stations 
additionally  the epa in september announced plans to revise the existing standards for waste water discharges from coal fired power plants 
until a rule is proposed and finalized  the financial and operational impacts cannot be determined 
further  the possible effects of climate change  including potentially increased temperatures and reduced precipitation  could make it more difficult and costly to comply with the final permit requirements 
solid waste solid and hazardous waste generation  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal is regulated at the federal and state levels under various laws and regulations 
the companies principally use coal in generating electricity and dispose of coal combustion residuals ccrs in both on site facilities and facilities owned by third parties 
in response to an incident at a tennessee valley authority coal combustion product containment area  the epa has proposed regulations regarding the handling and disposal of ccrs  which include alternative proposals to regulate ccrs as special or hazardous wastes or as non hazardous wastes 
if enacted  any new laws and regulations  especially if ccrs are classified as hazardous waste  could have a material adverse effect on the companies results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
remediation under current law  the companies are also generally responsible for any liabilities associated with the environmental condition of their properties  and other properties at which the companies arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances  including properties that they have previously owned or operated  such as manufactured gas plants mgp  regardless of whether they were responsible for the contamination or whether the liabilities arose before  during or after the time they owned or operated the properties or arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances 
in addition  the epa has given advance notice of a proposed rulemaking to impose financial assurance requirements for various classes of facilities  including electric generation  transmission and distribution  that produce  transport  treat  store or dispose of certain hazardous substances 
due to all of the above  the companies projected capital and other expenditures for environmental compliance are subject to significant uncertainties  including the timing of implementation of any new or modified environmental requirements  the emissions limits imposed by such requirements and the types and costs of the compliance alternatives selected by the companies 
as a result  costs to comply with environmental requirements cannot be estimated with certainty  and actual costs could be significantly higher than projections 
other new environmental laws and regulations affecting the operations of the companies may be adopted  and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to the companies or their facilities  any of which may materially adversely affect the companies business  adversely affect the companies ability to continue operating its power plants as currently done and substantially increase their environmental expenditures or liabilities in the future 
financial risks financial market disruptions and declines in credit ratings may increase financing costs and or limit access to the credit markets  which may adversely affect liquidity and results 
the companies capital requirements are expected to be substantial over the next several years 
the companies rely on access to short term money markets  revolving credit facilities provided by financial institutions and long term capital markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by cash flows from operations 
the companies also rely on bank provided credit facilities for credit support  such as letters of credit  to support operations 
the amount of credit support required for operations varies with a number of factors  including the amount and price of wholesale power purchased or sold 
great plains energy  kcp l  gmo and certain of their securities are rated by moody investors service and standard poor 
these ratings impact the companies cost of funds and great plains energy s ability to provide credit support for its subsidiaries 
the interest rates on borrowings under the companies revolving credit agreements and on a substantial portion of great plains energy s and gmo s debt are subject to increase as their respective credit ratings decrease 
the companies have agreed to not seek rate recovery of gmo interest costs in excess of equivalent investment grade debt  and the mpsc approval of the gmo acquisition is conditioned on the requirement that any post acquisition financial effects of a credit downgrade of great plains energy  kcp l or gmo occurring as a result of the acquisition would be borne by shareholders and not utility customers 
the amount of collateral or other credit support required under power supply and certain other agreements is also dependent on credit ratings 
the capital and credit markets experienced unprecedented levels of volatility and disruption in recent years 
though market conditions have stabilized  there is no assurance that conditions will not deteriorate in the future 
adverse market conditions or decreases in great plains energy s  kcp l s or gmo s credit ratings could have material adverse effects on the companies 
these effects could include  among others reduced access to capital and increased cost of funds  dilution resulting from equity issuances at reduced prices  changes in the type and or increases in the amount of collateral or other credit support obligations required to be posted with contractual counterparties  increased nuclear decommissioning trust and pension and other post retirement benefit plan funding requirements  rate case disallowance of kcp l s or gmo s costs of capital  reductions in or delays of capital expenditures  or reductions in great plains energy s ability to provide credit support for its subsidiaries 
any of these results could adversely affect the companies results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
in addition  market disruption and volatility could have an adverse impact on the companies lenders  suppliers and other counterparties or customers  causing them to fail to meet their obligations 
a sustained decline in great plains energy s stock price below book value may result in goodwill impairments that could adversely affect great plains energy s results of operations and financial position  as well as credit facility covenants 
the gmo acquisition resulted in great plains energy recording million in goodwill 
accounting rules require goodwill to be tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs indicating the possibility that an impairment exists 
great plains energy s stock traded at a price below carrying value throughout if the stock price were to decline substantially further from its current level in relation to carrying value  accounting rules may require great plains energy to conduct additional goodwill impairment tests 
there is no assurance that the results of these additional tests will not require great plains energy to recognize an impairment of goodwill 
an impairment of goodwill would reduce net income and shareholders equity  may adversely affect great plains energy s results of operations and financial position  and in certain circumstances could result in a breach of the debt to total capitalization covenants in great plains energy s and gmo s revolving credit agreements 
great plains energy has guaranteed substantially all of the outstanding debt of gmo and payments under these guarantees may adversely affect great plains energy s liquidity 
in connection with the gmo acquisition  great plains energy issued guarantees covering substantially all of the outstanding debt of gmo and has guaranteed gmo s current million revolving credit facility 
the guarantees were a factor in gmo receiving investment grade ratings and the guarantees obligate great plains energy to pay amounts owed by gmo directly to the holders of the guaranteed debt in the event gmo defaults on its payment obligations 
great plains energy may also guarantee debt that gmo may issue in the future 
any guarantee payments could adversely affect great plains energy s liquidity 
the inability of great plains energy s subsidiaries to provide sufficient dividends to great plains energy  or the inability otherwise of great plains energy to pay dividends to its shareholders and meet its financial obligations would have an adverse effect 
great plains energy is a holding company with no significant operations of its own 
the primary source of funds for payment of dividends to its shareholders and its other financial obligations is dividends paid to it by its subsidiaries  particularly kcp l and gmo 
the ability of great plains energy s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions  and accordingly  great plains energy s ability to pay dividends on its common stock and meet its financial obligations principally depends on the actual and projected earnings and cash flow  capital requirements and general financial position of its subsidiaries  as well as on regulatory factors  financial covenants  general business conditions and other matters 
in addition  great plains energy  kcp l and gmo are subject to certain corporate and regulatory restrictions and financial covenants that could affect their ability to pay dividends 
great plains energy s articles of incorporation restrict the payment of common stock dividends in the event common equity is or less of total capitalization 
in addition  if preferred stock dividends are not declared and paid when scheduled  great plains energy could not declare or pay common stock dividends or purchase any common shares 
if the unpaid preferred stock dividends equal four or more full quarterly dividends  the preferred shareholders  voting as a single class  could elect the smallest number of directors necessary to constitute a majority of the full great plains energy board of directors 
certain conditions in the mpsc and kcc orders authorizing the holding company structure require great plains energy and kcp l to maintain consolidated common equity of at least and  respectively  of total capitalization including only the amount of short term debt in excess of the amount of construction work in progress 
under the federal power act  kcp l and gmo generally can pay dividends only out of retained earnings 
the revolving credit agreements of great plains energy  kcp l and gmo contain a covenant requiring each company to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization ratio of not more than to 
in addition  great plains energy is prohibited from paying dividends on its common and preferred stock in the event its equity unit contract payments or interest payments on the debt underlying the equity units are deferred until such deferrals have been paid 
while these corporate and regulatory restrictions and financial covenants are not expected to affect the companies ability to pay dividends at the current level in the foreseeable future  there is no assurance that adverse financial results would not trigger such restrictions or covenants and reduce or eliminate the companies ability to pay dividends 
market performance  increased retirements and retirement plan regulations could significantly impact retirement plan funding requirements and associated cash needs and expenses 
substantially all of the companies and wolf creek nuclear operating corporation s employees participate in defined benefit retirement and post retirement plans 
former employees also have accrued benefits in defined benefit retirement and post retirement plans 
the costs of these plans depend on a number of factors  including the rates of return on plan assets  the level and nature of the provided benefits  discount rates  the interest rates used to measure required minimum funding levels  changes in benefit design  changes in laws or regulations  and the companies required or voluntary contributions to the plans 
the companies currently have substantial unfunded liabilities under these plans 
also  if the rate of retirements exceeds planned levels  or if these plans experience adverse market returns on investments  or if interest rates materially fall  the companies contributions to the plans could rise substantially over historical levels 
in addition  changes in accounting rules and assumptions related to future costs  returns on investments  interest rates and other actuarial assumptions  including projected retirements  could have a significant impact on the companies results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
the use of derivative contracts in the normal course of business could result in losses that could negatively impact the companies results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
the companies use derivative instruments  such as swaps  options  futures and forwards  to manage commodity and financial risks 
losses could be recognized as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts  if a counterparty fails to perform  or if the underlying transactions which the derivative instruments are intended to hedge fail to materialize 
in the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources  the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management s judgment or use of estimates 
as a result  changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts 
as a service provider to gmo  kcp l may have exposure to gmo s financial performance and operations 
gmo has no employees of its own 
kcp l employees operate and manage gmo s properties  and kcp l charges gmo for the cost of these services 
these arrangements may pose risks to kcp l  including possible claims arising from actions of kcp l employees in operating gmo s properties and providing other services to gmo 
kcp l s claims for reimbursement for services provided to gmo are unsecured and rank equally with other unsecured obligations of gmo 
kcp l s ability to be reimbursed for the costs incurred for the benefit of gmo depends on the financial ability of gmo to make such payments 
customer and weather related risks changes in customer electricity consumption due to sustained financial market disruptions  downturns or sluggishness in the economy  technological advances  or otherwise may adversely affect the companies results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
the results of operations  financial position and cash flows of the companies can be materially affected by changes in customer electricity consumption 
the companies estimate customer electricity consumption based on historical trends to procure fuel and purchased power 
sustained downturns or sluggishness in the economy generally affect the markets in which the companies operate 
additionally  technological advances or other energy conservation measures could reduce customer electricity consumption 
weather is a major driver of the companies results of operations  financial position and cash flow 
weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and affect the price of energy commodities 
great plains energy and kcp l are significantly impacted by seasonality  with approximately one third of their retail electric revenues recorded in the third quarter 
unusually mild winter or summer weather can adversely affect sales 
in addition  severe weather  including but not limited to tornados  snow  rain and ice storms can be destructive causing outages and property damage that can potentially result in additional expenses  lower revenues and additional capital restoration costs 
some of the companies stations use water from the missouri river for cooling purposes 
low water and flow levels  which have been experienced in past years  can increase maintenance costs at these stations and  if these levels were to get low enough  could require modifications to plant operations 
conversely  missouri river flooding has occurred at various times in past years  which has affected plant operations 
the possible effects of climate change such as increased temperatures  increased occurrence of severe weather or reduced precipitation  among other possible results could potentially increase the volatility of demand and prices for energy commodities  the frequency and impact of severe weather  increase the frequency of flooding or decrease water and flow levels 
operational risks operations risks may adversely affect the companies results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
the operation of the companies electric generation  transmission  distribution and information systems involves many risks  including breakdown or failure of equipment  processes and personnel performance  problems that delay or increase the cost of returning facilities to service after outages  operating limitations that may be imposed by equipment conditions  environmental  safety or other regulatory requirements  fuel supply or fuel transportation reductions or interruptions  transmission scheduling constraints  and catastrophic events such as fires  explosions  terrorism  cyber threats  severe weather or other similar occurrences 
an equipment or system outage or constraint can  among other things in the case of generation equipment  affect operating costs  increase capital requirements and costs  increase purchased power volumes and costs and reduce wholesale sales opportunities  in the case of transmission equipment  affect operating costs  increase capital requirements and costs  require changes in the source of generation and affect wholesale sales opportunities and the ability to meet regulatory reliability and security requirements  in the case of distribution systems  affect revenues and operating costs  increase capital requirements and costs  and affect the ability to meet regulatory service metrics and customer expectations  and in the case of information systems  affect the control and operations of generation  transmission  distribution and other business operations and processes  increase operating costs  increase capital requirements and costs  and affect the ability to meet regulatory reliability and security requirements and customer expectations 
with the exception of hawthorn no 
 which was substantially rebuilt in  and iatan no 
 which was completed in  all of kcp l s coal fired generating units and its nuclear generating unit were constructed prior to all of gmo s coal fired generating units were constructed prior to the age of these generating units increases the risk of unplanned outages  reduced generation output and higher maintenance expense 
training  preventive maintenance and other programs have been implemented  but there is no assurance that these programs will prevent or minimize future breakdowns or failures of the companies generation facilities or increased maintenance expense 
the companies currently have general liability and property insurance in place to cover their facilities in amounts that management considers appropriate 
these policies  however  do not cover the companies transmission or distribution systems  and the cost of repairing damage to these systems may adversely affect the companies results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage 
insurance coverage may not be available in the future at reasonable costs or on commercially reasonable terms  and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of  or any damage to  any of the companies facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage 
these and other operating events may reduce the companies revenues  increase their costs  or both  and may materially affect their results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
the cost and schedule of construction projects may materially change and expected performance may not be achieved 
great plains energy s and kcp l s businesses are capital intensive  and require significant capital investments to maintain existing facilities  for projected environmental projects and to add new facilities 
the risks of any construction project include the possibilities that actual costs may exceed estimated costs due to inflation or other factors  delays may occur in obtaining permits and materials  suppliers and contractors may not perform as required under their contracts  there may be inadequate availability or increased cost of equipment  materials or qualified craft labor  the scope  cost and timing of projects may change due to new or changed environmental requirements or other factors  and other events beyond the companies control may occur that may materially affect the schedule  cost and performance of these projects 
these and other risks could materially increase the estimated costs of construction projects  delay the in service dates of projects  adversely affect the performance of the projects  and or require the companies to purchase additional electricity to supply their respective retail customers until the projects are completed 
the companies currently are not permitted to start recovering the costs of these projects in rates until they are completed and put into service 
thus  these risks may significantly affect the companies results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
failure of one or more generation plant co owners to pay their share of construction or operations and maintenance costs could increase the companies costs and capital requirements 
kcp l owns of wolf creek  of lacygne station  of iatan no 
and of iatan no 
gmo owns of both iatan units and of jeffrey energy center 
the remaining portions of these facilities are owned by other utilities that are contractually obligated to pay their proportionate share of capital and other costs 
while the ownership agreements provide that a defaulting co owner s share of the electricity generated can be sold by the non defaulting co owners  there is no assurance that the revenues received will recover the increased costs borne by the non defaulting co owners 
occurrence of these or other events could materially increase the companies costs and capital requirements 
commodity price risks changes in commodity prices could have an adverse effect on the companies results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
the companies engage in the wholesale and retail marketing of electricity and are exposed to risks associated with the price of electricity 
to the extent that exposure to the price of electricity is not successfully hedged  the companies could experience losses associated with the changing market price for electricity 
increases in fuel  fuel transportation and purchased power prices could have an adverse impact on the companies costs 
kcp l s kansas retail rates contain an energy cost adjustment mechanism 
kcp l s missouri retail rates do not contain a similar provision 
gmo s retail electric and steam rates contain a fuel adjustment mechanism under which most  but not all  of the difference between actual fuel and purchased power costs and the amount of fuel and purchased power costs provided in base rates is passed along to gmo s customers 
as a result  the companies are exposed to varying degrees of risk from changes in the market prices of fuel for generation of electricity and purchased power 
changes in the companies fuel mix due to electricity demand  plant availability  transportation issues  fuel prices  fuel availability and other factors can also adversely affect the companies fuel and purchased power costs 
the companies do not hedge their respective entire exposure from fuel and transportation price volatility 
consequently  the companies results of operations  financial position and cash flows may be materially impacted by changes in these prices unless and until increased costs are recovered in kcp l s missouri retail rates 
wholesale electricity sales affect revenues  creating earnings volatility 
the levels of the companies wholesale sales depend on the wholesale market price  transmission availability and the availability of generation for wholesale sales  among other factors 
a substantial portion of wholesale sales are made in the spot market  and thus the companies have immediate exposure to wholesale price changes 
wholesale power prices can be volatile and generally increase in times of high regional demand and high natural gas prices 
while an allocated portion of wholesale sales are reflected in kcp l s kansas energy cost adjustment and gmo s fuel adjustment mechanisms  kcp l s missouri rates are set on an estimated amount of wholesale sales 
kcp l will not recover any shortfall in non firm wholesale electric sales margin from the level included in missouri rates and any amount above the level reflected in missouri retail rates will be returned to missouri retail customers in a future rate case 
declines in wholesale market price  availability of generation  transmission constraints in the wholesale markets  or low wholesale demand could reduce the companies wholesale sales 
kcp l is exposed to risks associated with the ownership and operation of a nuclear generating unit  which could result in an adverse effect on the companies business and financial results 
kcp l owns of wolf creek 
the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities  including wolf creek 
in the event of non compliance  the nrc has the authority to impose fines  shut down the facilities  or both  depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation  until compliance is achieved 
any revised safety requirements promulgated by the nrc could result in substantial capital expenditures at wolf creek 
wolf creek has the lowest fuel cost per mwh of any of kcp l generating units 
an extended outage of wolf creek  whether resulting from nrc action  an incident at the plant or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on kcp l results of operations  financial position and cash flows in the event kcp l incurs higher replacement power and other costs that are not recovered through rates or insurance 
if a long term outage occurred  the state regulatory commissions could reduce rates by excluding the wolf creek investment from rate base 
as discussed in operational risks  above  wolf creek was constructed prior to  and the age of wolf creek increases the risk of unplanned outages and higher maintenance costs 
ownership and operation of a nuclear generating unit exposes kcp l to risks regarding decommissioning costs at the end of the unit life 
kcp l contributes annually based on estimated decommissioning costs to a tax qualified trust fund to be used to decommission wolf creek 
the funding level assumes a projected level of return on trust assets 
if the actual return on trust assets is below the projected level or actual decommissioning costs are higher than estimated  kcp l could be responsible for the balance of funds required and may not be allowed to recover the balance through rates 
kcp l is also exposed to other risks associated with the ownership and operation of a nuclear generating unit  including  but not limited to  potential liability associated with the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of a nuclear generating unit and the storage  handling  disposal and potential release by accident  through third party actions or otherwise of radioactive materials 
under the structure for insurance among owners of nuclear generating units  kcp l is also liable for potential retrospective premium assessments subject to a cap per incident at any commercial reactor in the country and losses in excess of insurance coverage 
litigation risks the outcome of legal proceedings cannot be predicted 
an adverse finding could have a material adverse effect on the companies results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
the companies are party to various material litigation and regulatory matters arising out of their business operations 
the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined  nor  in many cases  can the liability that could potentially result from a negative outcome in each case presently be reasonably estimated 
the liability that the companies may ultimately incur with respect to any of these cases in the event of a negative outcome may be in excess of amounts currently reserved and insured against with respect to such matters

electric utility s retail electricity rates are below the national average of investor owned utilities 
earnings overview great plains energy s earnings available for common shareholders increased to million or per share from million or per share in primarily driven by an increase in gross margin due to new retail rates and favorable weather 
gross margin is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
see the explanation of gross margin and the reconciliation to gaap operating revenues under great plains energy s results of operations for further information 
partially offsetting the increase in gross margin was higher operations and maintenance expense driven by planned plant outages  increased depreciation and amortization expense due to additional regulatory amortization pursuant to kcp l s rate cases and depreciation from placing in service the iatan no 
environmental equipment in and iatan no 
in kansas jurisdiction only  increased general taxes and a decrease in the equity component of afudc

kansas regulatory proceedings in december  kcp l filed a request with kcc to increase retail electric annual revenues by million 
the request was subsequently adjusted by kcp l during the rate case proceedings to million as the net result of updates to the case 
the request included costs related to iatan no 
 a new coal fired generation unit  upgrades to the transmission and distribution system to improve reliability and overall increased costs of service 
in november  kcc issued its order  effective december   authorizing an increase in annual revenues of million  a return on equity of  an equity ratio of approximately and a kansas jurisdictional rate base of billion 
the annual revenue increase was subsequently adjusted by kcc in a january reconsideration order to million 
in february  kcc issued an order granting kcp l and another party to the case their respective petitions for reconsideration regarding rate case expenses 
the million annual revenue increase is considered as interim subject to refund or true up pending the outcome of the reconsideration proceedings regarding rate case expenses 
also in february  kcp l and another party to the case filed petitions for judicial review with the court of appeals of the state of kansas  which are stayed until conclusion of the reconsideration proceedings 
the rates authorized by kcc will be effective unless and until modified by kcc or stayed by a court 
accounting rules state that when it becomes probable that part of the cost of a recently completed plant will be disallowed for rate making purposes and a reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made  the estimated amount of the probable disallowance shall be deducted from the reported cost of the plant and recognized as a loss 
as a result of disallowances in the kcc order  kcp l recognized kansas jurisdictional losses of million for construction costs related to iatan no 
and million for construction costs related to the iatan no 
environmental project 
management determined it is probable that the mpsc would disallow these costs as well in kcp l s and gmo s pending rate cases 
therefore  kcp l s missouri jurisdictional portion and gmo s portion of these costs were recognized as a loss in addition to the kcp l kansas jurisdictional portion resulting in a million pre tax loss representing kcp l s and gmo s combined share for construction costs incurred through december missouri regulatory proceedings the following table summarizes pending requests for retail rate increases with the mpsc

any authorized changes to retail rates are expected to be effective in may for kcp l and june for gmo 
b the requested increase was adjusted by kcp l in a february   filing with the mpsc to million mainly due to lower fuel and purchased power costs  as there is no fuel recovery mechanism  and increased deferred income taxes from bonus depreciation 
the lower fuel and purchased power costs were driven by more favorable coal transportation costs and lower actual fuel and purchased power costs than the amounts included in the june   initial request

in september  gmo received an order from the mpsc approving construction accounting for the iatan no 
project from the iatan no 
in service date to the effective date of new rates in the current rate case 
the effect of the order is to defer gmo s share of iatan no

in november  the mpsc staff filed its construction audit and prudence review regarding construction expenditures through june   for iatan no 
and the iatan no

the mpsc staff recommended disallowances of approximately million and million of the total costs incurred through june   for iatan no 
and the iatan no 
environmental project  respectively  representing all audited expenditures above the associated december control budget estimates of approximately billion and million 
the mpsc staff also filed testimony in kcp l s and gmo s rate cases in november the mpsc staff s testimony recommended a return on equity range of to and revenue increase decrease ranges of approximately million to million for kcp l  approximately million to million for gmo s missouri public service division  and approximately million to million for gmo s st

joseph light power division 
the revenue recommendations reflect the mpsc staff s proposed construction cost disallowances of all audited expenditures as of october   above the control budget estimates  among other differences from kcp l s and gmo s requests 
hearings were held beginning in late january for kcp l and ran through mid february for gmo 
the mpsc staff will file reconciliations of the differences between its february   recommendations and kcp l s and gmo s february   recommendations with hearings scheduled for march  new rates are expected to go into effect in may for kcp l and june for gmo 
transmission investment opportunities in september  gmo accepted a notification to construct from spp for the missouri portion of a mile  kv transmission line in gmo s service territory from sibley  missouri to nebraska city  nebraska 
construction of the line is expected to occur over to  with an estimated cost of about million for gmo s portion of the line 
this line is one of a number of priority projects that the spp has developed as part of its transmission expansion plans for the region 
in june  ferc approved the spp s proposed cost allocation method for these projects 
kcp l has also accepted a notification to construct from spp for a mile  kv transmission line  with estimated construction costs of million and an expected in service date  from kcp l s iatan generating station to kcp l s nashua substation 
gmo and kcp l have the obligation to build their separate lines  which may be done solely or with other entities  unless the obligation is transferred to another qualified transmission owner 
gmo and kcp l have not determined which of these alternative courses of action to pursue 
spp retains the authority to revise or withdraw existing notifications to construct for transmission projects based upon emerging transmission plans and the associated needs for specific projects

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been used could have a material impact on great plains energy s results of operations and financial position 
management has identified the following accounting policies as critical to the understanding of great plains energy s results of operations and financial position 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the great plains energy board of directors board 
pensions great plains energy and kcp l incur significant costs in providing non contributory defined pension benefits 
the costs are measured using actuarial valuations that are dependent upon numerous factors derived from actual plan experience and assumptions of future plan experience 
pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age  life expectancies  compensation levels and employment periods  earnings on plan assets  the level of contributions made to the plan  and plan amendments 
in addition  pension costs are also affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs 
the assumed rate of return on plan assets was developed based on the weighted average of long term returns forecast for the expected portfolio mix of investments held by the plan 
the assumed discount rate was selected based on the prevailing market rate of fixed income debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the benefit obligation 
these assumptions  updated annually at the measurement date  are based on management s best estimates and judgment  however  material changes may occur if these assumptions differ from actual events 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and net costs 
the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a increase or a decrease in key actuarial assumptions 
each sensitivity reflects the impact of the change based on a change in that assumption only 
impact on impact on projected change in benefit pension actuarial assumption assumption obligation expense millions discount rate increase rate of return on plan assets increase discount rate decrease rate of return on plan assets decrease pension expense for kcp l is recorded in accordance with rate orders from the mpsc and kcc 
the orders allow the difference between pension costs under gaap and pension costs for ratemaking to be recorded as a regulatory asset or liability with future ratemaking recovery or refunds  as appropriate 
kcp l recorded pension expense of million after allocations to the other joint owners of generating facilities and capitalized amounts in accordance with the mpsc and kcc rate orders 
gmo records pension expense in accordance with rate orders from the mpsc 
the difference between this expense and gaap expense is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the accounting for pensions 
the company projected weighted average long term rate of return on plan assets is  a decrease from the reduction in the rate of return is expected to increase gaap pension expense approximately million 
market conditions and interest rates significantly affect the future assets and liabilities of the plan 
it is difficult to predict future pension costs  changes in pension liability and cash funding requirements due to volatile market conditions 
regulatory matters great plains energy and kcp l have recorded assets and liabilities on their consolidated balance sheets resulting from the effects of the ratemaking process  which would not otherwise be recorded under gaap 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that are probable of recovery from future revenues 
regulatory liabilities represent future reductions in revenues or refunds to customers 
management regularly assesses whether regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as decisions by the mpsc  kcc or ferc in electric utility s rate case filings  decisions in other regulatory proceedings  including decisions related to other companies that establish precedent on matters applicable to electric utility  and changes in laws and regulations 
if recovery or refund of regulatory assets or liabilities is not approved by regulators or is no longer deemed probable  these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in the current period results of operations 
electric utility s continued ability to meet the criteria for recording regulatory assets and liabilities may be affected in the future by restructuring and deregulation in the electric industry or changes in accounting rules 
in the event that the criteria no longer applied to all or a portion of electric utility s operations  the related regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless an appropriate regulatory recovery mechanism is provided 
additionally  these factors could result in an impairment on utility plant assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
impairments of assets  intangible assets and goodwill long lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization are required to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable as prescribed under gaap 
accounting rules require goodwill to be tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs indicating the possibility that an impairment exists 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill  to identify potential impairment 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  the second step of the test is performed  consisting of assignment of the reporting unit s fair value to its assets and liabilities to determine an implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine the impairment loss  if any  to be recognized in the financial statements 
great plains energy s regulated electric utility operations are considered one reporting unit for assessment of impairment  as they are included within the same operating segment and have similar economic characteristics 
great plains energy s stock traded at a price below carrying value throughout if the stock price were to decline substantially further from its current level in relation to carrying value  accounting rules may require great plains energy to conduct additional goodwill impairment tests 
there is no assurance that the results of these additional tests will not require great plains energy to recognize an impairment of goodwill 
the annual impairment test for the million of gmo acquisition goodwill was conducted on september  fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount by over million  including goodwill  therefore  there was no impairment of goodwill 
the determination of fair value of the reporting unit consisted of two valuation techniques an income approach consisting of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach consisting of a determination of reporting unit invested capital using market multiples derived from the historical revenue  ebitda and net utility asset values and market prices of stock of electric and gas company regulated peers 
the results of the two techniques were evaluated and weighted to determine a point within the range that management considered representative of fair value for the reporting unit  which involves a significant amount of management judgment 
the discounted cash flow analysis is most significantly impacted by two assumptions estimated future cash flows and the discount rate applied to those cash flows 
management determined the appropriate discount rate to be based on the reporting unit s weighted average cost of capital wacc 
the wacc takes into account both the cost of equity and after tax cost of debt 
estimated future cash flows are based on great plains energy s internal business plan  which assumes the occurrence of certain events in the future  such as the outcome of future rate filings  future approved rates of return on equity  anticipated earnings returns related to future capital investments  continued recovery of cost of service and the renewal of certain contracts 
management also makes assumptions regarding the run rate of operations  maintenance and general and administrative costs based on the expected outcome of the aforementioned events 
should the actual outcome of some or all of these assumptions differ significantly from the current assumptions  revisions to current cash flow assumptions could cause the fair value of great plains energy s reporting unit under the income approach to be significantly different in future periods and could result in a future impairment charge to goodwill 
the market approach analysis is most significantly impacted by management s selection of relevant electric and gas company regulated peers as well as the determination of an appropriate control premium to be added to the calculated invested capital of the reporting unit  as control premiums associated with a controlling interest are not reflected in the quoted market price of a single share of stock 
management determined an appropriate control premium by using an average of control premiums for recent acquisitions in the industry 
changes in results of peer companies  selection of different peer companies and future acquisitions with significantly different control premiums could result in a significantly different fair value of great plains energy s reporting unit 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset liability approach 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred investment tax credits are amortized ratably over the life of the related property 
deferred tax assets are also recorded for net operating loss  capital loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the company is required to estimate the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
this process requires management to make assessments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact 
the company records valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
additionally  the company establishes reserves for uncertain tax positions based upon management s judgment regarding potential future challenges to those positions 
the accounting estimates related to the liability for uncertain tax positions require management to make judgments regarding the sustainability of each uncertain tax position based on its technical merits 
if it is determined that it is more likely than not a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits  the impact of the position is recorded in the company s consolidated financial statements at the largest amount that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
these estimates are updated at each reporting date based on the facts  circumstances and information available 
management is also required to assess at each reporting date whether it is reasonably possible that any significant increases or decreases to the unrecognized tax benefits will occur during the next twelve months

gross margin gross margin is a financial measure that is not calculated in accordance with gaap 
gross margin  as used by great plains energy and kcp l  is defined as operating revenues less fuel  purchased power and transmission of electricity by others 
expenses for fuel  purchased power and transmission of electricity by others  offset by wholesale sales margin  are subject to recovery through cost adjustment mechanisms  except for kcp l s missouri retail operations 
as a result  operating revenues increase or decrease in relation to a significant portion of these expenses 
management believes that gross margin provides a more meaningful basis for evaluating electric utility s operations across periods than operating revenues because gross margin excludes the revenue effect of fluctuations in these expenses 
gross margin is used internally to measure performance against budget and in reports for management and the board 
the companies definition of gross margin may differ from similar terms used by other companies

bulk power sales  the major component of wholesale sales  vary with system requirements  generating unit and purchased power availability  fuel costs and requirements of other electric systems 
electric utility s revenues contain certain fuel recovery mechanisms as follows kcp l s kansas retail rates contain an eca tariff 
the eca tariff reflects the projected annual amount of fuel  purchased power  emission allowances  transmission costs and asset based off system sales margin 
these projected amounts are subject to quarterly re forecasts 
any difference between the eca revenue collected and the actual eca amounts for a given year which may be positive or negative is recorded as an increase to or reduction of retail revenues and deferred as a regulatory asset or liability to be recovered from or refunded to kansas retail customers over twelve months beginning april of the succeeding year 
gmo s electric retail rates contain an fac tariff under which of the difference between actual fuel cost  purchased power costs and off system sales margin and the amount provided in base rates for these costs is passed along to gmo s customers 
the fac cycle consists of an accumulation period of six months beginning in june and december with fac rate approval requested every six months for a twelve month recovery period 
the fac is recorded as an increase to or reduction of retail revenues and deferred as a regulatory asset or liability to be recovered from or refunded to gmo s electric retail customers 
gmo s steam rates contain a qca under which of the difference between actual fuel costs and base fuel costs is passed along to gmo s steam customers 
the qca is recorded as an increase to or reduction of other revenues and deferred as a regulatory asset or liability to be recovered from or refunded to gmo s steam customers 
kcp l s missouri retail rates do not contain a fuel recovery mechanism  meaning that changes in fuel and purchased power costs will not be reflected in rates until new rates are authorized by the mpsc creating a regulatory lag between the time costs change and when they are reflected in rates 
this regulatory lag applies to all costs not included in fuel recovery mechanisms as described above 
in the current rising cost environment  regulatory lag can be expected to have an adverse impact  which could be material  on great plains energy s results of operations 
additionally  kcp l s retail rates in missouri reflect a set level of non firm wholesale electric sales margin 
kcp l will not recover any shortfall in non firm wholesale electric sales margin from the level included in missouri retail rates and any amount of margin above the level reflected in missouri retail rates will be returned to kcp l missouri retail customers in a future rate case 
electric utility s gross margin increased million in compared to primarily due to the increase in retail revenues driven by new retail rates effective august  and september   for kansas and missouri  respectively  and favorable weather 
retail mwhs sold in increased due to favorable weather  with a increase in heating degree days and a increase in cooling degree days 
cooling degree days were above normal based on a year average 
wholesale mwhs sold increased due to a increase in generation resulting in more mwhs available for sale  partially offset by the higher retail load requirements 
the increase in generation was primarily a result of iatan no 
being placed in service during and iatan no 
being off line from january through mid april to complete an environmental upgrade and unit overhaul  with the expenditures being capitalized and therefore not impacting operating and maintenance expenses 
the coal base load equivalent availability factor increased to in compared to for electric utility s gross margin increased million in compared to driven by the inclusion of gmo for a full year and an increase in retail revenues due to new retail rates effective august   and september   for kansas and missouri  respectively 
the increase to retail revenues was partially offset by a decline in weather normalized customer usage driven by weakened economic conditions and unfavorable summer weather in  with a decrease in cooling degree days 
cooling degree days were below normal based on a year average 
the following table provides cooling degree days cdd and heating degree days hdd for the last three years at the kansas city international airport 
cdd and hdd are used to reflect the demand for energy to cool or heat homes and buildings 
change change cdd hdd electric utility other operating expenses including utility operating and maintenance expenses  general taxes and other electric utility s other operating expenses increased million in compared to plant operating and maintenance expenses increased million in compared to primarily driven by planned plant outages  including the impact of outages in that included capitalizable improvements and therefore did not impact operating and maintenance expenses  partially offset by million expensed in september after kcp l exercised its option to terminate an agreement for the construction of a wind project 
the accounting effects of the kcc rate order increased other operating expenses million in general taxes increased million in compared to driven by increased gross receipts taxes on increased retail revenues and increased property taxes 
accounting rules state that when it becomes probable that part of the cost of a recently completed plant will be disallowed for rate making purposes and a reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made  the estimated amount of the probable disallowance shall be deducted from the reported cost of the plant and recognized as a loss 
as a result of disallowances in the kcc order  kcp l recognized kansas jurisdictional losses of million for construction costs related to iatan no 
and million for construction costs related to the iatan no 
environmental project 
management determined it is probable that the mpsc would disallow these costs as well in kcp l s and gmo s pending rate cases 
therefore  kcp l s missouri jurisdictional portion and gmo s portion of these costs were recognized as a loss in addition to the kcp l kansas jurisdictional portion resulting in a million pre tax loss representing kcp l s and gmo s combined share for construction costs incurred through december electric utility s other operating expenses increased million in compared to driven by the inclusion of gmo for a full year  increased employee related costs and a million payment to terminate an agreement for the construction of a wind project 
these increases were partially offset by increased use of internal labor on capital projects as a result of more efficient operations as well as spending reductions and the impact of realized synergies from the gmo acquisition 
electric utility depreciation and amortization electric utility s depreciation and amortization costs increased million in compared to primarily due to million of additional regulatory amortization pursuant to kcp l s rate cases 
the remaining increase was due to placing in service the iatan no 
environmental equipment during and commencement of depreciation on iatan no 
during kansas jurisdiction only  as well as normal depreciation activity for other capital additions 
electric utility s depreciation and amortization costs increased million in compared to driven by the inclusion of gmo for a full year  million of additional regulatory amortization pursuant to kcp l s rate cases  the impact of placing iatan no

electric utility interest charges electric utility s interest charges decreased million in compared to primarily due to the deferral to a regulatory asset of construction accounting carrying costs for iatan no 
 iatan no 
and common facilities and the maturity of million of gmo s senior notes in december these decreases were partially offset by a decrease in the debt component of afudc resulting from a lower average construction work in progress balance due to kcp l s comprehensive energy plan projects being placed in service  interest for a full year on kcp l s million of mortgage bonds series a issued in march and interest on an intercompany note from great plains energy to gmo issued in august electric utility s interest charges increased million in compared to driven by the inclusion of gmo for a full year  interest on kcp l s million of mortgage bonds series a issued in march and interest for a full year on million of unsecured senior notes issued in march these increases were partially offset at kcp l by decreased commercial paper outstanding  decreased rates on commercial paper and an increase in the debt component of afudc resulting from a higher average construction work in progress balance due to kcp l s comprehensive energy plan projects 
electric utility income tax expense electric utility s income tax expense increased million in compared to due to increased pre tax income and a million increase in income tax expense for the cumulative change in tax treatment of the medicare part d subsidy under the federal health care reform legislation signed into law in electric utility s income tax expense decreased million in compared to due to an increase in kcp l s deferred tax balances in of million as a result of an increase in the composite tax rate reflecting the sale of strategic energy 
additionally  reflected million of allocated tax benefits from holding company losses 
the tax sharing agreement between great plains energy and its subsidiaries was modified on july  as part of the new agreement  parent company tax benefits are no longer allocated to kcp l or other subsidiaries 
the inclusion of gmo for a full year in also partially offset the decrease in income tax expense 
great plains energy significant balance sheet changes december  compared to december  great plains energy s accounts receivable pledged as collateral and collateralized note payable of million reflects the adoption on january   of new accounting rules for transfers of financial assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
great plains energy s refundable income taxes decreased million primarily due to income tax refunds received 
great plains energy s deferred income taxes current assets decreased million primarily due to a reclassification to deferred income taxes long term driven by a change in the expected timing of utilizing net operating loss benefits as a result of bonus depreciation available in great plains energy s assets held for sale decreased million due to the sale of two properties with book values of million and the reclassification of the remaining properties with book values of million to other investments and other assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information

 spearville wind energy facility and the iatan no 
environmental project and certain iatan facility common costs  respectively  in addition to normal plant activity 
great plains energy s construction work in progress decreased billion primarily due to projects placed in service as described above  in addition to normal plant activity 
great plains energy s affordable housing limited partnerships decreased million primarily due to the write down of these investments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
great plains energy s notes payable decreased million primarily due to repayment with proceeds from the issuance of million of senior notes  partially offset by a million payment for the settlement of forward starting swaps fss and additional borrowings to support other normal operating activities 
great plains energy s commercial paper increased million primarily due to increased borrowings driven by the timing of cash payments 
great plains energy s accounts payable decreased million primarily due to the timing of cash payments  including payments related to kcp l s comprehensive energy plan 
great plains energy s derivative instruments current liabilities increased million primarily due to mark to market losses on great plains energy s fss  which is offset in oci 
great plains energy s deferred income taxes long term increased million primarily due to a million increase in temporary differences mostly as a result of bonus depreciation  partially offset by a reclassification with deferred income taxes current assets described above 
great plains energy s long term debt decreased million primarily to reflect gmo s million senior notes  million senior notes and kcp l s million senior notes as current maturities 
current maturities of long term debt increased similarly 
partially offsetting the decrease in long term debt was great plains energy s issuance of million of senior notes in august capital requirements and liquidity great plains energy operates through its subsidiaries and has no material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries 
great plains energy s ability to make payments on its debt securities and its ability to pay dividends is dependent on its receipt of dividends or other distributions from its subsidiaries  proceeds from the issuance of its securities and borrowing under its revolving credit facility 
great plains energy s capital requirements are principally comprised of debt maturities and electric utility s construction and other capital expenditures 
these items as well as additional cash and capital requirements are discussed below 
great plains energy liquid resources at december   consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and million of unused bank lines of credit 
the unused lines consisted of million from great plains energy revolving credit facility  million from kcp l credit facilities and million from gmo s revolving credit facility 
at february   great plains energy s unused bank lines of credit decreased million from the amount at december   primarily due to the repayment of gmo s million of senior notes that matured in february  in addition to the timing of cash payments driven by normal business cycles and operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these credit facilities 
generally  great plains energy uses these liquid resources to meet its day to day cash flow requirements  and from time to time issues equity and or long term debt to repay short term debt or increase cash balances 
great plains energy intends to meet day to day cash flow requirements including interest payments  retirement of maturing debt  construction requirements  dividends and pension benefit plan funding requirements with a combination of internally generated funds and proceeds from the issuance of equity securities  equity linked securities and or short term and long term debt 
great plains energy s intention to meet a portion of these requirements with internally generated funds may be impacted by the effect of inflation on operating expenses  the level of retail mwh sales  regulatory actions  compliance with environmental regulations and the availability of generating units 
in addition  great plains energy may issue equity  equity linked securities and or debt to finance growth 
at december   great plains energy s long term debt maturities in and were million and million  respectively 
in february  repayment of gmo s million of senior notes that matured in february reduced the long term debt maturities to million 
great plains energy is evaluating alternatives to refinance the remaining long term debt  including issuing new long term debt 
based on current market conditions and great plains energy s unused bank lines of credit  great plains energy expects to have the ability to access the markets to complete the necessary refinancing 
cash flows from operating activities great plains energy generated positive cash flows from operating activities for the periods presented 
the increase in cash flows from operating activities for great plains energy in compared to is primarily due to an increase in net income  an increase in deferred income taxes from utilizing bonus depreciation  which defers the cash payment for taxes on current year income  and a decrease in cash flows for accounts payable due to the completion of significant construction projects 
on january   great plains energy adopted new accounting rules for transfers of financial assets  which resulted in the recognition of million of accounts receivables pledged as collateral and a corresponding short term collateralized note payable on great plains energy s balance sheet at december  see note for additional information 
as a result  cash flows from operating activities were reduced by million and cash flow from financing activities were raised by million with no impact to the net change in cash in additionally  cash flows from operating activities in reflect the payment of million for the settlement of fss upon the issuance of million of mortgage bonds series a 
other changes in working capital are detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the individual components of working capital vary with normal business cycles and operations 
the decrease in cash flows from operating activities for great plains energy in compared to is primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable due to the timing of cash payments and completing significant construction projects and the payment of million for the settlement of fss upon the issuance of million of mortgage bonds series a in partially offsetting these decreases was kcp l s payment of million for the settlement of three treasury locks t locks 
additionally  cash flows from operating activities include strategic energy 
great plains energy sold strategic energy in other changes in working capital are detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the individual components of working capital vary with normal business cycles and operations 
cash flows from investing activities great plains energy s cash used for investing activities varies with the timing of utility capital expenditures and purchases of investments and nonutility property 
investing activities are offset by the proceeds from the sale of properties and insurance recoveries 
great plains energy s utility capital expenditures decreased million in compared to due to a decrease in cash utility capital expenditures primarily related to the iatan no 
environmental project  iatan no 
and spearville wind energy facility 
great plains energy s utility capital expenditures decreased million in compared to due to a decrease in kcp l s cash utility capital expenditures primarily related to the iatan no 
environmental project and iatan no 
in  great plains energy completed the sale of strategic energy and received gross cash proceeds of million 
at the time of the sale  strategic energy had million of cash  resulting in proceeds from the sale of strategic energy  net of cash sold of million 
on july   great plains energy closed its acquisition of gmo 
great plains energy paid cash consideration of billion 
at the time of the acquisition  gmo had approximately billion of cash from the sale of its electric and gas utility assets in colorado  kansas  nebraska and iowa to black hills 
cash flows from financing activities great plains energy s cash flows from financing activities in reflect the issuance  at a discount  of million of senior notes that mature in great plains energy used the proceeds to make a three year intercompany loan to gmo with gmo using the proceeds to repay short term borrowings 
also reflected is the million impact of the short term collateralized note payable described above under cash flows from operating activities 
great plains energy s cash flows from financing activities in reflect gross proceeds of million from the issuance of million shares of common stock at per share and gross proceeds of million from the issuance of million equity units 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the equity units 
also reflected in the cash flows from financing activities in is kcp l s issuance  at a discount  of million of mortgage bonds series a that mature in additionally  great plains energy sold million shares of common stock for million in gross proceeds under a sales agency financing agreement with bny mellon capital markets  llc bnymcm 
great plains energy paid million in for fees related to all issuances of debt and common stock 
the proceeds from these issuances were used primarily to repay short term borrowings 
great plains energy s cash flows from financing activities in reflect kcp l s issuance of million of unsecured senior notes that mature in the proceeds were used to repay short term borrowings 
gmo repaid million on a credit agreement that was terminated in and subsequently borrowed million under its new revolving credit facility 
additionally  gmo terminated various other credit agreements and paid million of termination fees 
impact of credit ratings on liquidity the ratings of great plains energy s  kcp l s and gmo s securities by the credit rating agencies impact their liquidity  including the cost of borrowings under their revolving credit agreements and in the capital markets 
the companies view maintenance of strong credit ratings as extremely important to their access to and cost of debt financing and to that end maintain an active and ongoing dialogue with the agencies with respect to results of operations  financial position  and future prospects 
while a decrease in these credit ratings would not cause any acceleration of great plains energy s  kcp l s or gmo s debt  it could increase interest charges under great plains energy s senior notes due  gmo s senior notes due  gmo s senior notes due and great plains energy s  kcp l s and gmo s revolving credit agreements 
a decrease in credit ratings could also have  among other things  an adverse impact  which could be material  on great plains energy s  kcp l s and gmo s access to capital  the cost of funds  the ability to recover actual interest costs in state regulatory proceedings  the type and amounts of collateral required under supply agreements and great plains energy s ability to provide credit support for its subsidiaries 
at december   the major credit rating agencies rated great plains energy s and kcp l s securities as detailed in the following table

see explanation of gross margin under great plains energy results of operations 
mwh sales change change retail mwh sales thousands residential commercial industrial other retail mwh sales total retail wholesale mwh sales total mwh sales kcp l s gross margin increased million in compared to primarily due to the increase in retail revenues driven by new retail rates effective august   and september   for kansas and missouri  respectively  and favorable weather 
kcp l s retail mwhs sold in increased due to favorable weather  with a increase in heating degree days and a increase in cooling degree days 
cooling degree days were above normal based on a year average 
wholesale mwhs sold increased due to a increase in generation resulting in more mwhs available for sale  partially offset by the higher retail load requirements 
the increase in generation was a result of iatan no 
being placed in service during and iatan no 
being off line from january through mid april to complete an environmental upgrade and unit overhaul  with the expenditures being capitalized and therefore not impacting operating and maintenance expenses 
as a result  kcp l s coal base load equivalent availability factor increased to in compared to in kcp l s gross margin increased million in compared to primarily due to new retail rates effective august   and september   for kansas and missouri  respectively  partially offset by a decline in weather normalized customer usage driven by weakened economic conditions and unfavorable summer weather in  with a decrease in cooling degree days 
cooling degrees days were below normal based on a year average 
kcp l other operating expenses including operating and maintenance expenses  general taxes and other kcp l s other operating expenses increased million in compared to plant operating and maintenance expenses increased million in compared to primarily driven by planned plant outages  including the impact of outages in that included capitalizable improvements and therefore did not impact operating and maintenance expenses  partially offset by million expensed in september after kcp l exercised its option to terminate an agreement for the construction of a wind project 
the accounting effects of the kcc rate order increased other operating expenses million in general taxes increased million in compared to driven by increased gross receipts taxes on increased retail revenues and increased property taxes 
accounting rules state that when it becomes probable that part of the cost of a recently completed plant will be disallowed for rate making purposes and a reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made  the estimated amount of the probable disallowance shall be deducted from the reported cost of the plant and recognized as a loss 
as a result of disallowances in the kcc order  kcp l recognized kansas jurisdictional losses of million for construction costs related to iatan no 
and million for construction costs related to the iatan no 
environmental project 
management determined it is probable that the mpsc would disallow these costs as well in kcp l s pending rate case 
therefore  kcp l s missouri jurisdictional portion of these costs was recognized as a loss in addition to the kcp l kansas jurisdictional portion resulting in a million loss for kcp l s construction costs incurred through december  kcp l s other operating expenses increased million in compared to primarily due to increased employee related costs and million expensed in september after kcp l exercised its option to terminate an agreement for the construction of a wind project 
these increases were partially offset by increased use of internal labor on capital projects as a result of more efficient operations as well as spending reductions and realized synergies from the gmo acquisition 
kcp l depreciation and amortization kcp l s depreciation and amortization costs increased million in compared to primarily due to million of additional regulatory amortization pursuant to kcp l s rate cases 
the remaining increase was due to placing in service the iatan no 
environmental equipment during and commencement of depreciation on iatan no 
during kansas jurisdiction only  as well as normal depreciation activity for other capital additions 
kcp l s depreciation and amortization costs increased million in compared to primarily due to million of additional regulatory amortization pursuant to kcp l s rate cases  placing the iatan no 
environmental project in service during and normal depreciation activity for other capital additions 
kcp l non operating income and expenses kcp l s non operating income and expenses decreased million in compared to primarily due to a decrease in the equity component of afudc resulting from a lower average construction work in progress balance due to kcp l s comprehensive energy plan projects being placed in service 
kcp l s non operating income and expenses increased million in compared to primarily due to an increase in the equity component of afudc resulting from a higher average construction work in progress balance due to kcp l s comprehensive energy plan projects 
kcp l interest charges kcp l s interest charges increased million in compared to primarily due to interest for a full year on million of mortgage bonds series a issued in march and a decrease in the debt component of afudc resulting from a lower average construction work in progress balance due to kcp l s comprehensive energy plan projects being placed in service  mostly offset by the deferral to a regulatory asset of construction accounting carrying costs for iatan no 
 iatan no 
and common facilities 
kcp l s interest charges increased million in compared to primarily due to interest on million of mortgage bonds series a issued in march and interest for a full year on million of unsecured senior notes issued in march  partially offset by decreased commercial paper outstanding  decreased rates on commercial paper and an increase in the debt component of afudc resulting from a higher construction work in progress balance due to comprehensive energy plan projects 
kcp l income tax expense kcp l s income tax expense increased million in compared to primarily due to increased pre tax income and a million increase in income tax expense for the cumulative change in tax treatment of the medicare part d subsidy under the federal health care reform legislation signed into law in the first quarter of kcp l s income tax expense decreased million in compared to primarily due to an increase in deferred tax balances in of million as a result of an increase in the composite tax rate reflecting great plains energy s sale of strategic energy 
additionally  reflected million of allocated tax benefits from holding company losses 
the tax sharing agreement between great plains energy and its subsidiaries was modified on july  as part of the new agreement  parent company tax benefits are no longer allocated to kcp l or other subsidiaries 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  great plains energy and kcp l face risks that are either non financial or non quantifiable 
such risks principally include business  legal  operations and credit risks and are not represented in the following analysis 
see item a 
risk factors and item md a for further discussion of risk factors 
great plains energy and kcp l are exposed to market risks associated with commodity price and supply  interest rates and equity prices 
management has established risk management policies and strategies to reduce the potentially adverse effects the volatility of the markets may have on its operating results 
during the ordinary course of business  under the direction and control of an internal risk management committee  great plains energy s and kcp l s hedging strategies are reviewed to determine the hedging approach deemed appropriate based upon the circumstances of each situation 
though management believes its risk management practices are effective  it is not possible to identify and eliminate all risk 
great plains energy and kcp l could experience losses  which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position  due to many factors  including unexpectedly large or rapid movements or disruptions in the energy markets  from regulatory driven market rule changes and or bankruptcy or non performance of customers or counterparties  and or failure of underlying transactions that have been hedged to materialize 
hedging strategies derivative instruments are frequently utilized to execute risk management and hedging strategies 
derivative instruments  such as futures  forward contracts  swaps or options  derive their value from underlying assets  indices  reference rates or a combination of these factors 
these derivative instruments include negotiated contracts  which are referred to as over the counter derivatives  and instruments listed and traded on an exchange 
interest rate risk great plains energy and kcp l manage interest expense and short and long term liquidity through a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
generally  the amount of each type of debt is managed through market issuance  but interest rate swap and cap agreements with highly rated financial institutions may also be used to achieve the desired combination 
at december   less than of great plains energy s long term debt was variable rate debt 
kcp l had no variable rate long term debt at december  interest rates impact the fair value of long term debt 
a change in interest rates would impact great plains energy and kcp l to the extent they redeemed any of their outstanding long term debt 
great plains energy s and kcp l s book values of long term debt were below fair value by and  respectively  at december  great plains energy had million of notes payable outstanding at december  the principal amount of the notes payable  which will vary during the year  drives great plains energy s notes payable interest expense 
assuming that million of notes payable was outstanding for all of  a hypothetical increase in interest rates associated with short term variable rate debt would result in an immaterial increase in interest expense for kcp l had million of commercial paper outstanding at december  the principal amount of the commercial paper  which will vary during the year  drives kcp l s commercial paper interest expense 
assuming that million of commercial paper was outstanding for all of  a hypothetical increase in commercial paper rates would result in an immaterial increase in interest expense for assuming that million of commercial paper was outstanding for all of  a hypothetical basis point increase in commercial paper rates would result in a million increase in interest expense for commodity risk great plains energy and kcp l engage in the wholesale and retail marketing of electricity and are exposed to risk associated with the price of electricity 
exposure to these risks is affected by a number of factors including the quantity and availability of fuel used for generation and the quantity of electricity customers consume 
customers electricity usage could also vary from year to year based on the weather or other factors 
quantities of fossil fuel used for generation vary from year to year based on the availability  price and deliverability of a given fuel type as well as planned and scheduled outages at facilities that use fossil fuels 
kcp l wholesale operations include the physical delivery and marketing of power obtained through its generation capacity 
kcp l also enters into additional power purchase transactions with the objective of obtaining the most economical energy to meet its physical delivery obligations to customers 
kcp l is required to maintain a capacity margin of at least of its peak summer demand 
this net positive supply of capacity and energy is maintained through kcp l s generation assets and capacity and power purchase agreements to protect kcp l from the potential operational failure of one of its power generating units 
kcp l continually evaluates the need for additional risk mitigation measures in order to minimize its financial exposure to  among other things  spikes in wholesale power prices during periods of high demand 
kcp l sales include the sales of electricity to its retail customers and bulk power sales of electricity in the wholesale market 
kcp l continually evaluates its system requirements  the availability of generating units  availability and cost of fuel supply  the availability and cost of purchased power and the requirements of other electric systems  therefore  the impact of the hypothetical amounts that follow could be significantly reduced depending on the system requirements and market prices at the time of the increases 
a hypothetical increase in the market price of power could result in a million decrease in operating income for related to purchased power 
in  approximately of kcp l s net mwhs generated are expected to be coal fired 
kcp l currently has of its coal requirements for under contract 
a hypothetical increase in the market price of coal could result in less than a million increase in fuel expense for kcp l has also implemented price risk mitigation measures to reduce its exposure to high natural gas prices 
a hypothetical increase in natural gas and oil market prices could result in an increase of million in fuel expense for at december   kcp l had hedged approximately  and of its  and  respectively  projected natural gas usage for generation requirements to serve retail load and firm mwh sales 
kcp l s kansas eca allows for the recovery of increased fuel and purchased power costs from kansas retail customers 
kcp l s missouri retail rates do not contain a fuel recovery mechanism  meaning that changes in fuel costs create a regulatory lag 
in the gmo regulated electric operations in  approximately of the power sold was generated and the remaining was purchased through long term contracts or in the open market 
gmo has an fac that allows gmo to adjust retail electric rates based on of the difference between actual fuel and purchased power costs and the amount of fuel and purchased power costs provided in base rates 
several measures have been taken to mitigate commodity price risk exposure in gmo s electric utility operations 
one of these measures is contracting for a diverse supply of coal to meet and of its and  respectively  native load fuel requirements of coal fired generation 
the price risk associated with natural gas and on peak spot market purchased power requirements is also mitigated through a hedging plan using new york mercantile exchange nymex futures contracts and options 
a hypothetical increase in natural gas market prices could result in an increase of million in fuel expense for at december   gmo had financial contracts in place to hedge approximately  and of expected on peak natural gas and natural gas equivalent purchased power price exposure for  and  respectively 
the mark to market value of these contracts at december   was a liability of million 
credit risk mps merchant mps merchant is exposed to credit risk 
credit risk is measured by the loss that would be recorded if counterparties failed to perform pursuant to the terms of the contractual obligations less the value of any collateral held 
mps merchant s counterparties are not externally rated 
credit exposure to counterparties at december   was million 
investment risk kcp l maintains trust funds  as required by the nrc  to fund its share of decommissioning the wolf creek nuclear power plant 
as of december   these funds were invested primarily in domestic equity securities and fixed income securities and are reflected at fair value on kcp l s balance sheets 
the mix of securities is designed to provide returns to be used to fund decommissioning and to compensate for inflationary increases in decommissioning costs  however  the equity securities in the trusts are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and the value of fixed rate fixed income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates resulting in a hypothetical decrease in the value of the fixed income securities would have resulted in a million reduction in the value of the decommissioning trust funds at december  a hypothetical decrease in equity prices would have resulted in an million reduction in the fair value of the equity securities at december  kcp l exposure to investment risk associated with the decommissioning trust funds is in large part mitigated due to the fact that kcp l is currently allowed to recover its decommissioning costs in its rates 
if the actual return on trust assets is below the anticipated level  kcp l could be responsible for the balance of funds required to decommission wolf creek  however  while there can be no assurances  management believes a rate increase would be allowed to recover decommissioning costs over the remaining life of the unit
