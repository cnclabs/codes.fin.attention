the orlando lease was historically accounted for as an operating lease 
pursuant to the terms of the lease  on october   we were required to provide notice to the lessor of our intention to either purchase the property for or arrange to have the office complex sold to a third party the terms of the lease provided the lessor with a residual value guarantee from us of up to 
although continuing to pursue a refinancing of the orlando lease  on october   we effectively elected the purchase option under the required notification provision of the lease agreement 
the election to purchase is considered a contract modification requiring reassessment of the classification of the lease under applicable accounting principles 
because of our effective election of the purchase option in october  the lease should have been classified as a capital lease instead of an operating lease at that time 
the impact of the reclassification as a capital lease on previously issued financial statements is not material 
as the change in accounting treatment did not involve additional cash outflows other than the payment related to the residual value guarantee referred to below  this did not impact capital expenditures or cash flows during on june   we refinanced this lease agreement 
as part of the refinancing  we paid approximately to reduce the principal under the prior facility related to the residual value guarantee provision referenced above  such amount having been previously accrued

market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
our risk management strategy includes the use of derivative instruments to reduce the effects on our operating results and cash flows from fluctuations caused by volatility in currency exchange and interest rates 
in using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates and interest rates  we expose ourselves to counterparty credit risk 
we manage exposure to counterparty credit risk by entering into derivative financial instruments with investment grade rated institutions that can be expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements and by diversifying the number of financial institutions with which we enter into such agreements 
interest rate risk at december   we had in outstanding variable rate borrowings and in outstanding fixed rate borrowings 
the carrying amount of our variable borrowings reflects fair value due to their short term and variable interest rate features 
our variable interest rate debt had an effective interest rate of during the year ended december  based upon our exposure to variable rate borrowings  a one percentage point change in the weighted average interest rate would change our annual interest expense by approximately we sometimes use interest rate swaps to hedge our interest rate exposure 
these instruments are hedges of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability 
these contracts are entered into to protect against the risk that the eventual cash flows resulting from such transactions will be adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
there were no outstanding interest rate swaps covering interest rate exposure at december  foreign currency exchange rate risk we serve many of our us based clients using contact center capacity in the philippines  india and canada 
although the contracts with these clients are typically priced in us dollars  a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts are denominated in philippine pesos php  indian rupees inr or canadian dollars cad  which represents a foreign exchange exposure

the potential loss in fair value at december  for such contracts resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in all foreign currency exchange rates is approximately this loss would be substantially mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures 
other foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency 
we periodically enter into forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges 
the purpose of these derivative instruments is to protect the company against foreign currency exposure pertaining to receivables  payables and intercompany transactions that are denominated in currencies different from the functional currencies of the company or the respective subsidiaries

goodwill the company has recorded on its consolidated balance sheet goodwill of and at december  and december   respectively 
the december  balance is after a goodwill impairment charge related to relationship technology management rtm reporting unit  which is within the customer management segment 
the rtm reporting unit is comprised primarily of intervoice  which was acquired in september the impairment charge for the company s rtm reporting unit was the result of a change in the strategic plan for the unit  which was finalized in the fourth quarter of  reflecting the output of the company s annual strategic business planning process 
as a result of declining revenue during the preceding months  lower future revenue projections and transaction valuation multiples lower than those supported at the time of the intervoice acquisition in  the fair value of the reporting unit was determined to be less than carrying value 
goodwill is allocated to the reporting units at the date the goodwill is initially recorded 
once goodwill has been allocated to the reporting units  it generally no longer retains its identification with a particular acquisition  but instead becomes identified with a reporting unit as a whole 
as a result  all of the fair value of each reporting unit is available to support the value of goodwill allocated to the unit 
as of december   the company operated in two core business segments as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level  one level below the business segment 
as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we test goodwill for impairment annually as of october and at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable  such as a significant adverse change in the business climate  a decision to sell or dispose of all or a significant portion of a reporting unit or a significant decline in the company s stock price 
for  the company tested goodwill for the following reporting units customer management live agents  customer management rtm rtm  and information management 
in  the information management reporting unit was tested on a disaggregated basis as the information management north america and information management international reporting units 
as a result of changes in the organizational and financial reporting structure of the company  these reporting units have now been combined 
under us gaap  the impairment test for goodwill involves a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit step 
if the fair value of the reporting units is in excess of the carrying value  the related goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no further analysis is necessary 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  there is an indication of potential impairment and a second step of testing is performed to measure the amount of the impairment  if any  for that reporting unit 
when required  the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination  which is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one over the fair value of the nets assets and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit were being acquired 
any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill will be recorded as an impairment loss 
an impairment charge recognized cannot exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to a reporting unit and cannot be reversed subsequently even if the fair value of the reporting unit recovers 
fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a combination of the market approach and the income approach 
under the market approach  fair value is based on actual stock prices or transaction prices of comparable companies 
the market approach requires significant judgment regarding the selection of comparable companies 
under the income approach  fair value is dependent on the present value of net cash flows to be derived from the ownership 
the income approach requires significant judgment including estimates about future cash flows and discount rates 
the forecasted cash flows are based upon the company s long term strategic business plan  and a terminal value is used to estimate the operating segment s cash flows beyond this plan 
the discount rate represents the weighted average cost of capital  which is an estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt market participants of a business enterprise 
both the market and income approaches require the use of significant judgments  including judgments about appropriate discount rates  perpetual growth rates and the timing of expected future cash flows 
discount rate assumptions are based upon an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows  and were concluded to be for all of the company s reporting units for sensitivity analyses were performed around discount rates and growth rates  including terminal growth rates  in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values 
a combination of methodologies is used and weighted appropriately for reporting units with significant adverse changes in business climate 
management may engage an independent valuation specialist to assist in the company s valuation process 
convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued amounts in millions except per share amounts based on the results of step for the rtm reporting unit  there was an indication of impairment as the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit 
accordingly  the second step of testing was performed for rtm 
based on the results of the second step  the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge net of tax in the fourth quarter of  included in the asset impairment caption in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the remaining goodwill balance allocated to the rtm reporting unit at december  is the results of step for customer management live agents and information management reporting units indicated there was no goodwill impairment 
a basis point increase in the discount rate and decrease in the expected future cash flows would not change the results of step we believe we make every reasonable effort to ensure that we accurately estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
however  future changes in the assumptions used to make these estimates  including future sales and margin trends  market conditions and cash flow could result in an impairment loss 
the company compared and assessed the total fair values of the reporting units to its market capitalization at the annual assessment date to determine if the fair values are reasonable compared to external market indicators 
the fair value of the company s reporting units reasonably approximates total market capitalization adjusted for a reasonable implied control premium 
other intangible assets at december   we had a carrying value of of other intangible assets  net of amortization  consisting of in software  which is classified in property  plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets  in trademarks related to the intervoice acquisition and in customer relationships 
as amortizable intangible assets  the company evaluates the intangible assets for recoverability on an annual basis or if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amounts  in accordance with asc  impairment or disposal of long lived assets asc  by comparing estimates of undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying values of the related assets 
the goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of was an impairment indicator  however  testing resulted in no impairment to the other intangible assets 
property  plant and equipment the cost of property  plant and equipment is depreciated by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the company reviews property  plant and equipment asset groups for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company monitors these changes and events on at least a quarterly basis 
examples of events or changes in circumstances could include  but are not limited to  a prolonged economic downturn  current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of an asset group  or a current expectation that an asset group will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
recoverability is based upon projections of anticipated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the use and eventual disposal of the property  plant and equipment asset groups  as well as specific appraisals in certain instances 
reviews occur at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of cash flows associated with other property  plant and equipment asset groups 
if the future undiscounted cash flows result in a value that is less than the carrying value  then the long lived asset is considered impaired and a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value 
various factors that the company uses in determining the impact of these assessments include the expected useful lives of long lived assets and our ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such asset groups  and are affected primarily by changes in the expected use of the assets  changes in technology or development of alternative assets  changes in economic conditions  changes in convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents operating performance and changes in expected future cash flows 
because judgment is involved in determining the fair value of property  plant and equipment asset groups  there is risk that the carrying value of these assets may require adjustment in future periods 
during the fourth quarter of  we committed to a plan to sell certain facilities included in the rtm reporting unit 
accordingly  the property met the criteria to be classified as held for sale and was required to be measured at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less costs to sell 
we determined the fair value was less than its carrying amount  therefore we recognized an impairment loss of after tax included in the asset impairment caption in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
income taxes the provision for income taxes includes income taxes paid  currently payable or receivable  and those deferred 
under us gaap  the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence 
this evidence includes historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
projected future taxable income is based on expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned 
the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences is based on current tax law and the company s tax methods of accounting 
the company also reviews its tax activities and evaluates uncertain tax positions using a two step approach 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit  which is the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the company s policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense 
significant judgment is required in determining our liability for uncertain tax positions 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be significantly different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
we believe that we make a reasonable effort to ensure accuracy in our judgments and estimates 
restructuring charges we recognize liabilities for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
during the last three years  we recorded restructuring charges related to reductions in headcount and facility closures 
as of december   we had a restructuring accrual of  of which relates to facility closure costs that will be paid over several years until the leases expire 
the accrual is equal to the future costs associated with the abandoned facilities  net of the proceeds from any probable future sublease agreements 
we have used estimates  based on consultation with real estate advisors  to estimate the proceeds from any future sublease agreements 
we will continue to evaluate our estimates in recording the facilities abandonment charge 
as a result  there may be additional charges or reversals in the future

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued amounts in millions except per share amounts revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are discussed in detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
a portion of our revenues is derived from transactions that require a significant level of judgment 
this includes percentage of completion we recognize some software license and related professional and consulting revenues using the percentage of completion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs at completion 
this method of accounting relies on estimates of total expected contract revenues and costs 
this method is used because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
because the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  which are assessed continually during the term of the contracts  recognized revenues are subject to revisions as the contracts progress to completion 
revisions in estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 
accordingly  favorable changes in estimates result in additional revenue recognition  and unfavorable changes in estimates result in the reversal of previously recognized revenues 
when estimates indicate a loss under a contract  a provision for such loss is recorded as a component of cost of providing services and products sold 
as work progresses under a loss contract  revenues continue to be recognized  and a portion of the contract loss incurred in each period is charged to the contract loss reserve 
license arrangements the accounting for our license and support and maintenance arrangements can be complex and requires a significant amount of judgment 
some of the factors that we must assess include the separate elements of the arrangement  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the various undelivered elements of the arrangement  whether the software fees are fixed or determinable  whether the fees are considered collectible and whether services included in the arrangement represent significant production  customization or modification of the software 
multiple element outsourcing arrangements we deliver multiple services under our client arrangements and we must assess these multiple element arrangements to determine whether they can be separated into more than one unit of accounting 
the authoritative guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables establishes the following criteria  all of which must be met  in order for a deliverable to qualify as a separate unit of accounting the delivered items have value to the client on a stand alone basis 
there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items  delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the company 
if these criteria are met  each of the contractual services included in the contract is treated as a separate unit of accounting and revenue is recognized as we deliver each of the contractual services 
if these criteria are not met  all of the services included are accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
revenue is then recognized either using a proportional performance method such as recognizing revenue based on transactional services delivered or on a straight line basis once we begin to deliver the final service 
the assessments of these areas require us to make a significant number of judgments 
the judgments made in these areas could have a significant effect on revenues recognized in any period by changing the amount and or the timing of the revenue recognized 
we believe that we make a reasonable effort to ensure accuracy in our judgment and estimates 
convergys corporation annual report

these estimates are in the areas of measuring our obligations related to our defined benefit plans  self insurance accruals and assessing recoverability of intangible assets
