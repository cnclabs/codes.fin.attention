item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
you should review the risk factors section of this annual report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements described in the following discussion and analysis 
overview we are an advanced electronic materials provider that develops  manufactures and sells monocrystalline sapphire and other innovative crystalline products for light emitting diodes leds  radio frequency integrated circuits rfics  blue laser diodes  optoelectronics and other optical applications 
the emergence of sapphire in commercial volumes at competitive prices has enabled the development of new technologies such as high brightness hb white  blue and green leds and highly integrated rfics 
we apply our proprietary crystal growth technology to produce high quality sapphire products efficiently to supply our end markets  and we work closely with our customers to meet their quality and delivery needs 
we are a vertically integrated manufacturer of high quality sapphire substrates and optical windows that are used in a variety of high growth  high volume end market applications 
our largest product line is two inch to six inch sapphire cores and wafers for use in leds and blue laser diodes for solid state lighting and electronic applications 
for the led market we sell two inch to four inch material primarily in core form and six and eight inch material primarily in polished wafer form 
eight inch wafers are sold primarily for research and development efforts at this time 
in addition  we sell six inch sapphire wafers that are used for silicon on sapphire sos rfics  as well as products for military  aerospace  sensor and other applications 
we have also extended our technology  which gives us the ability to produce cores and wafers of up to twelve inches in diameter to support next generation led and sos rfic production 
we have also developed the ability to produce large diameter circular and rectangular sapphire windows for use in various optical window applications 
our revenue consists of sales of sapphire materials sold in core  as cut  as ground and polished wafer forms in two  three  four  six and eight inch diameters as well as optical materials sold as blanks or polished windows 
in  our sales have been focused on core and large diameter polished wafers where our profit margins are higher 
products are made to varying specifications  such as crystal planar orientations and thicknesses 
our revenue in the fourth quarter of and through most of was significantly impacted by the global recession 
much of the sapphire we sell into the marketplace goes into led lighting for consumer electronics 
consumer spending on these products declined during the recession  which decreased demand for our products 
toward the end of  and throughout demand for sapphire strengthened as consumers resumed spending on consumer electronics  driven  in part  by the introduction of new products such as led backlit lcd televisions 
in addition  general lighting applications for leds continued to expand 
we expect continued strong demand throughout we sell our products on a global basis 
the asian  north american and european markets accounted for  and  respectively  of our revenue for the year ended december    and  respectively  of our revenue for the year ended december   and  and  respectively  for the year ended december  revenue declined in all markets in primarily due to the recession 
in addition  our north american revenue in was impacted by lower orders in the period from our key customer in the sos rfic market due to a build up of inventory at that customer 
demand from the led market was very strong in  particularly in asia where there is a high concentration of customers that support the led market 

table of contents we currently depend on a small number of suppliers for certain raw materials  components  services and equipment  including key materials such as aluminum oxide and certain furnace components 
if the supply of these components were to be disrupted or terminated  or if these suppliers were unable to supply the quantities of raw materials required  we may have difficulty in finding or may be unable to find alternative sources for these items 
as a result  we may be unable to meet the demand for our products  which could have a material adverse impact on us 
we provide direct sales from our bensenville  illinois offices 
substantially all of our revenue is generated by our direct sales force and we expect this to continue in the future 
we manufacture and ship our products from our facilities in the chicago metropolitan area and from our facility in penang  malaysia 
we have approximately  square feet of manufacturing and office space in franklin park and bensenville  illinois 
in  we completed construction of a  square foot facility in penang  malaysia  which will process sapphire grown by us in our illinois facilities into finished cores and wafers 
this facility is processing cores and some wafer production came on line at the end of the fourth quarter of we also acquired in april a  square foot building in batavia  illinois to expand our crystal growth operations 
this facility also began operations in the fourth quarter of financial operations revenue 
our revenue consists of sales of sapphire materials sold in core  as cut  as ground and polished forms in two  three  four  six and eight inch diameters as well as optical materials sold as blanks or polished windows 
products are made to varying specifications  such as crystal planar orientations and thicknesses 
we have focused on increasing sales of larger diameter substrates  which we define as three inch or greater in diameter  as they generally yield higher gross margins 
average selling prices for our products declined significantly in late and early due to weak demand 
sales decreased across all product lines for the year ended december   due primarily to the global recession 
demand began to improve in the second half of and continued to improve throughout due to the strong demand from the led market 
sales increased significantly across most product lines and diameters for the year ended december   as demand for our products increased due to improved market and pricing environment 
historically  a significant portion of our revenue has been derived from sales to relatively few customers 
for the year ended december   we had three customers that accounted for approximately   and of our revenue 
for the year ended december   we had three customers that accounted for approximately   and of our revenue 
for the year ended december   we had four customers that accounted for approximately   and of our revenue 
other than as discussed above  none of our customers accounted for more than of our revenue for such periods 
although we are attempting to diversify and expand our customer base  we expect our revenue to continue to be concentrated among a small number of customers 
we expect that our significant customers may change from period to period 
we recognize revenue upon shipment to our customers 
delays in product orders or changes to the timing of shipments could cause our quarterly revenue to vary significantly 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from customers outside of the us the majority of our sales are to the asian market and we expect that region to continue to be a major source of revenue for us 
all of our revenue and corresponding accounts receivable are denominated in us dollars 
cost of goods sold 
our cost of goods sold consists primarily of manufacturing materials  labor  manufacturing related overhead such as utilities  depreciation and rent  provisions for excess and obsolete inventory reserves  freight and warranties 
we manufacture our products at our franklin park  bensenville and batavia  illinois and penang  malaysia manufacturing facilities based on customer orders 
we purchase materials and supplies to support such demand 
we are subject to variations in the cost of raw materials and consumables from period to period because we do not have long term fixed price agreements with most of our suppliers 
for the years ended december   and  utility costs represented approximately  and 
table of contents of our cost of goods sold  respectively 
we mitigate the potential impact of fluctuations in energy costs by entering into long term purchase agreements 
once our current agreements expire  if electricity prices increase significantly  we may not be able to pass these price increases through to our customers on a timely basis  if at all  which could adversely affect our gross margins and results of operations 
gross profit 
with the return of demand for sapphire and the resulting increase in average selling prices in late  we returned to a gross profit in the fourth quarter of demand and pricing continued to increase throughout significantly increasing gross profit 
our gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including average sales prices of our products  product mix  our ability to reduce manufacturing costs and fluctuations in the cost of electricity  raw materials and other supplies 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses g a consist primarily of salaries and associated costs for employees in finance  human resources  information technology and administrative activities  charges for outside accounting  legal  insurance fees and stock based compensation 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and associated costs for employees engaged in sales activities  commissions paid to third party representatives  product samples  charges for participation in trade shows and travel 
research and development expenses 
research and development r d expenses include costs related to engineering personnel  materials and other product development related costs 
r d is expensed as incurred 
we believe our r d expenses will generally increase as we continue to develop new products 
other income expense 
other income expense consists of interest income and expense and gains and losses on investments and currency translation 
we repaid most of our outstanding indebtedness with a portion of the proceeds from our initial public offering in november and repaid the remainder in february provision for income tax 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method whereby the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book value and the tax basis of assets and liabilities are recognized as deferred tax assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recognized 
a full valuation allowance is provided as management cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
at december   we had million in net operating loss carryforwards nols 
we have updated our analysis of ownership changes that limit the utilization of the net operating losses 
this analysis shows an ownership change  but we believe that we are not restricted in our ability to use the full amount of the nols 
as of december   no tax benefit has been recognized for these loss carryforwards 
we expect to maintain a full valuation allowance on our remaining net deferred tax assets until an appropriate level of profitability that generates taxable income is sustained or until we are able to develop tax strategies that would enable us to conclude that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets will be realizable 
it is possible that we will release the valuation allowance within the next twelve months 
any reversal of the valuation allowances will favorably impact our results of operations in the period of the reversal 
in addition  federal and certain state and non us income taxes attributable to the fiscal year s pre tax income will be provided for in the period of the reversal and in subsequent periods  which will reduce net income 
the illinois state legislature has suspended the use of net operating loss carryforwards for taxable years ending after december  and before december  and has increased the corporate income tax rate 
consequently  we expect to record income taxes in which will reduce net income 
stock based compensation 
the majority of our stock based compensation relates primarily to administrative personnel and is accounted for as a general and administrative expense 
for the years ended december   and  our stock based compensation expense was million   and  respectively

table of contents comparison of years ended december  and revenue 
revenue was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
we experienced a significant increase in revenue across most product lines and diameters due to increased demand for our products due to an improved market and pricing environment 
revenue from the sales of core products for the year ended december  increased by million  of which million was attributed to volume and million was attributed to increased pricing 
revenue from the sales of polished products for the year ended december  increased by million  of which million was related to an increase in volume  and million was attributed to pricing 
of that increase in revenue from the sales of polished products for the year ended december   million was attributed to the increase in the sale of our led substrate products and million was attributed to the increase in the sale of our sos rfic products 
revenue for the sale of our as cut and as ground products decreased million  attributed to focusing production on higher margin core and polished wafer products 
we also experienced an increase in revenue from the sale of our optical products for the year ended december   of million 
we expect demand for our products to remain strong for  however we believe it is unlikely that pricing for our products will continue to rise as they did in gross profit loss 
gross profit loss was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the increase in gross profit is primarily attributable to higher revenue of million and better utilization of equipment and staff  which led to improved operating leverage and throughput 
in addition  sales of larger diameter products  which generally had a higher gross profit margin  increased by million 
general and administrative expenses 
g a expenses were million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
the increase was primarily due to an increase of employee compensation costs of million  of which million was from performance based bonus costs as no bonus was earned in and million from annual salary increases and expenses associated with issuance and exercise of employee stock options 
our bad debt expense increased by  as compared to due to the considerable increase in sales volume in and due to lower than normal bad debt expense in as we were able to reduce our reserve as our customer s improved economic condition reduced the uncertainty regarding our customer s ability to pay an over day past due receivable 
we also experienced an increase in expenses of  from additional recruiting  training  travel  information technology and other miscellaneous expenses related to the startup of the malaysian facility 
in addition  franchise taxes increased by  primarily due to higher stock share count 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   an increase of  the increase in sales and marketing expenses is primarily attributable to additional employee compensation costs from additional sales hires to support expansion  annual salary increases and employee stock options expense 
research and development expenses 
r d expenses were million for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december   an increase of  the increase is attributable to higher employee compensation costs and an increase in spending on research projects 
other income 
other income was  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december   a decrease in other income of  the decrease was primarily due to a  decrease in interest income as a result of lower interest rates as well as a  loss on currency translation not incurred in comparison of years ended december  and revenue 
revenue was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
the impact of the worldwide economic crisis 
table of contents resulted in lower revenue across all product lines for the year ended december  revenue from the sale of our led substrate products for the year ended december  decreased million 
an million decrease in revenue due to lower average selling prices as a result of reduced demand was partially offset by an increase in volume of million 
the sos rfic business was also impacted by the downturn in the consumer electronics market 
in addition  revenue from this market was impacted by lower orders in from our key sos rfic customer due to a build up of inventory at that customer 
revenue for the sos rfic business decreased  or million  of which million was attributable to a decrease in volume and  was attributable to a decrease in pricing 
we completed an r d contract in and  as a result  our revenue from research and development was million lower in than it was in the prior year 
revenue from our optical products was lower in by million as the market for sapphire used for sensor and instrumentation applications was also affected by the economic slowdown 
demand for our products began to improve in the second half of and our average selling prices began to increase in the fourth quarter of fourth quarter total revenue increased from the fourth quarter as the market began to rebound significantly 
gross profit loss 
gross profit loss was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
the revenue decline of million in was partially offset by a reduction in manufacturing expenses of million 
we also experienced lower contract revenue of million in which had little or no direct costs 
with the decrease in orders we also experienced lower utilization of equipment and staff which resulted in underabsorbed manufacturing costs of million 
the remaining decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to lower average selling prices 
in the fourth quarter  we achieved a positive gross profit margin of general and administrative expenses 
g a expenses were million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
the decrease was primarily due an adjustment to our bad debt reserve of million 
we were able to reduce our reserve in as our customer s improved economic condition reduced the uncertainty regarding our customer s ability to pay us 
we also experienced a decrease of  of costs associated with a follow on public offering incurred in which did not occur in  and a  decrease in bonuses as no bonus expense was incurred in the decreases were offset by  in increased legal costs   in increased salary and stock compensation expenses  and  in higher business insurance premiums 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december   an increase of  the increase in sales and marketing expenses is primarily attributable to additional payroll expenses of  which includes a salesperson in the japan sales office that opened in  as well as  in costs associated with operating the sales office in japan 
research and development expenses 
r d expenses were  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december   a decrease of  the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in payroll costs of  offset by an increase of  in materials purchased for research projects and other costs 
other income 
other income was  for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   a decrease in other income of million 
the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in interest income as a result of lower investment principal and lower average returns 
liquidity and capital resources we historically funded our operations using a combination of issuances of common stock and preferred stock  a working capital line of credit  term loans and cash generated from our operations 

table of contents as of december   we had cash and short term investments totaling million  including cash of million held in deposits at major banks  million invested in money market funds and short term investments in commercial paper  corporate bonds  and us treasury securities of million 
our long term investment consists of a million investment in peregrine semiconductor  corp 
one of our customers series d preferred stock 
in february  we began experiencing failed auctions of our entire auction rate securities portfolio  resulting in our inability to sell these securities in the short term 
we held put options associated with an agreement with ubs  ag related to all of our auction rate securities purchased through them 
we had the option to sell these securities to ubs  ag at par value from june  through july  we exercised these put options on june  with settlement on july  for a payment equal to full par value of the auction rate securities 
our right to sell the auction rate securities to ubs  ag commencing on june   represented put options for a payment equal to the par value of the auction rate securities 
during the years ended december    and  we recorded a realized loss gain of   and  respectively  representing the changes in fair value of the put options 
we also recorded during the years ended december    and  a realized gain loss of   and  respectively  representing the changes in fair value of the auction rate securities 
both the gain and loss from recording the change in fair value of the put options and auction rate securities were recorded in gain loss on investments in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company s investment policy no longer allows auction rate securities as an approved investment 
cash flows from operating activities year ended december  in thousands net income loss non cash items depreciation and amortization stock based compensation and other  net total non cash items working capital accounts receivable accounts payable other accruals inventories prepaid expenses and other current assets total working capital items net cash provided by used in operating activities cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  during such period  we generated net income of million  which included non cash charges of million  including depreciation expense of million and stock based compensation expense of million 
cash from net working capital decreased million  which was comprised of an increase in accounts receivable of million due to higher sales and volumes  an increase in accounts payable of million due to increased manufacturing production and timing of payments  an increase in other accruals of million consisting primarily of an increase in deposits of million from customer prepayments  and an increase in accrued payroll of million from increased headcount and bonus accrual 
there was also an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million due to an increase in purchases of furnace construction and replacement parts for both the illinois and malaysia facilities  and an increase in inventory of million  of which million was attributed to an increase in the stock of raw material 

table of contents cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  during such period  we generated a net loss of million  which included non cash charges of million  including depreciation expense of million and stock based compensation expense of  during such period  cash from net working capital increased by  which was composed of an increase in accounts receivable of million due to higher sales in the fourth quarter  an increase of accrued other liabilities of  primarily due to the amount owed on land purchased in malaysia  a decrease in inventory of million due to sales product mix requirements  a decrease in spare parts of million due to the increased usage of furnace material inventory  a decrease in accounts payable of  due to timing of ordering and payments and a decrease in accrued payroll of  attributable to the decrease in performance based bonus expenses offset by the increase in headcount 
cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  during such period  we generated net income of million  which included non cash charges of million  including depreciation expense of million  net loss on disposal of equipment of million  and stock based compensation expense of  we experienced an increase during such period in inventory of million due primarily to an increase in safety stocks of raw material and sapphire boule inventory of million and an increase of million in other work in process and finished goods inventory 
there is no shelf life to our raw material and essentially all of our products can be manufactured from any one boule 
therefore  building a safety stock of this inventory enables us to quickly respond to an increase in demand from our customers 
we also experienced an increase in spare parts of million due to an increase in furnace material inventory used to support a larger number of furnaces  deferred revenue decreased by  due to recognition of revenue deferred on a research and development project  accrued payroll decreased by  on a lower performance based bonus accrual and other accrued liabilities decreased by  due to timing of payments 
cash flows used in investing activities net cash provided by used in investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  we used approximately million on building and equipment for our new crystal growth facility in batavia  illinois  and approximately million on building and equipping of our new post crystal growth facility in malaysia 
we used proceeds from our common stock offering completed on june  of approximately million to purchase investment securities 
this was partially offset by sales of investments of million which were used to fund operations and capital spending 
in  we used approximately million to purchase components to construct additional crystal growth furnaces  approximately  to expand and upgrade our bensenville  illinois facility and  for other upgrades in our fabrication  slicing  and polishing operations 
we also used  to purchase land in malaysia to continue to expand our capacity 
we purchased additional investments of  using investment earnings proceeds 
this was offset by proceeds from sales of investments of million 
in  we used approximately million to purchase components used to construct additional crystal growth furnaces  approximately million for infrastructure changes needed to expand operations in our bensenville  illinois facility and approximately million to purchase various equipment used to expand our production capacity in support of our sales growth 
we purchased additional investments of million using investment earnings proceeds 
this was partially offset by proceeds from sales of investments of million 
we are continuing to equip our new our crystal growth facility in illinois and post crystal growth facility in malaysia 
it is difficult to predict the timing of capital expenditures on these projects  but we anticipate spending an additional to million completing these two new facilities in and we estimate our total capital expenditures to be between million and million

however  we may secure debt or additional equity financing over the next year to provide additional liquidity 
our cash needs include cash required to fund our operations  taking into account the capital needed to fund our planned expansions in the us and asia 
if the assumptions underlying our business plan regarding future revenues and expenses change  or if unexpected opportunities or needs arise  we may seek to raise additional cash by selling equity or convertible debt securities 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted  and these newly issued securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders 
if we obtain debt financing  a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness  and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations 
if we are unable to obtain financing on terms favorable to us  we may be unable to successfully execute our business plan 
contractual obligations the contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments at december  changes in our business needs as well as actions by third parties and other factors may cause these estimates to change 
because these estimates are complex and necessarily subjective  our actual payments in future periods are likely to vary from those presented in the table 
the following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations at december  payments due in total less than year years years more than years in millions operating lease obligations purchase order obligations building construction obligations total contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements during  and  we did not engage in any off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any interest in entities referred to as variable interest entities  which includes special purpose entities and other structured finance entities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the risk of loss related to changes in market prices  including interest rates  of financial instruments that may adversely impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange risk 
as a result of our global operations we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect our results and financial position 
primary exposures are 
table of contents related to the us dollar versus the malaysian ringgit 
to date  substantially all of our international sales have been transacted in us dollars 
while we continue to monitor this exchange risk  we are not currently entered into any foreign currency hedging transactions 
interest rate risk 
we do not have any long term borrowings 
our investments consist of cash  cash equivalents  commercial paper  corporate bonds  and us treasury securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
we do not enter into investments for speculative purposes 
our investments are exposed to market risk due to a fluctuation in interest rates  which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments 
due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio  we do not believe an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio  and therefore we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected by a sudden change in market interest rates 
inflation 
our operations have not been  and we do not expect them to be  materially affected by inflation 
however  historically  the prices we charge our customers are market driven  and therefore we may not be able to increase our prices to offset any increase in our material or labor costs 
our inability or failure to do so could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
although these estimates are based on our present best knowledge of the future impact on the company of current events and actions  actual results may differ from these estimates  assumptions and judgments 
we consider to be critical those accounting policies that require our most subjective or complex judgments  which often result from a need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain  and that are among the most important of our accounting policies in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies  including the more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements 
foreign currency translation and transactions 
rubicon worldwide llc s assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at exchange rates existing at the respective balance sheet dates and capital accounts at historical exchange rates 
the results of operations are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates during the respective period 
translation adjustments resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates for rubicon worldwide llc are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity 
we have determined that the functional currency of rubicon sapphire technology malaysia sdn bhd is the us dollar 
rubicon sapphire technology malaysia sdn bhd s assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using the remeasurement method 
non monetary assets are translated at historical exchange rates and monetary assets are translated at exchange rates existing at the respective balance sheet dates 
translation adjustments for rubicon sapphire technology malaysia sdn bhd are included in determining net income loss for the period 
the results of operations are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates during the respective period 
we record these gains and losses in other income expense 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are generated from the effects of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in a currency other than our functional currency  which is the us dollar 
gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are generally required to be recognized in the determination of net income loss for the period 
we record these gains and losses in other income expense 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from sales of products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
we require evidence of a purchase order with the customer specifying the terms and specifications of the product to be delivered  typically in the form of a signed contract  quotation or purchase order from the customer 
title has passed and the product has been delivered 
title passage and product delivery generally occur when the product is delivered to a common carrier 
the price is fixed or determinable 
all terms are fixed in the signed quotation or purchase order received from the customer 
the purchase orders do not contain rights of cancellation  return  exchanges or refunds 
collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
our standard arrangement with customers includes day payment terms 
customers are subject to a credit review process that evaluates each customer s financial position and its ability to pay 
we determine collectability by considering the length of time the customer has been in business and our history of collections with that customer 
if it is determined that collection is not probable  no product is shipped and no revenue is recognized unless cash is received in advance 
all of our revenue is denominated in us dollars 
inventory 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
market is determined based on net realizable value 
costs for raw materials  work in process and finished goods are based on actual costs on a first in  first out basis 
we establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based on customer required specifications 
we evaluate the ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors  including forecasted sales  estimated current and future market value and changes in customers product specifications 
inventory reserves decreased in by  primarily on disposal of obsolete inventory  resetting of standard costs on certain inventory items to net realizable value and ability to sell previously determined excess quantities 
our method of estimating excess and obsolete inventory has remained consistent for all periods presented 
however  if our recognition of excess or obsolete inventory is  or if our estimates of our inventory s potential utility become  less favorable than currently expected  additional inventory reserves may be required 
we determine our normal operating capacity and record as expense costs attributable to lower utilization of equipment and staff 
during the beginning of and for all of  we determined we were not operating at capacity and recorded as expense costs associated with lower utilization of equipment and staff of  and million  respectively 
with the improved demand and pricing of our products  we believe that it is unlikely that significant adjustments for lower utilization of equipment and staff will occur in investments 
we invest available cash primarily in investment grade commercial paper  corporate notes and government securities 
investments classified as available for sale securities are carried at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
investments in trading securities are reported at fair value  with both realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in other income expense  in the consolidated statements of operations 
investments in which we have the ability and intent  if necessary  to liquidate in order to support our current operations are classified as short term 
our long term investments at december  consist of a million investment in peregrine semiconductor  corp 
a customer series d preferred shares 
we review our available for sale securities investments at the end of each quarter for other than temporary declines in fair value based on the specific identification method 
we consider various factors in determining whether an impairment is other than temporary  including the severity and duration of the impairment  changes in underlying credit ratings  forecasted recovery  our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value and the probability that the scheduled cash payments will continue to be made 
when we conclude that an other than temporary impairment has resulted  the 
table of contents difference between the fair value and carrying value is written off and recorded as a charge on the consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   no impairment was recorded 
in october  we entered into an agreement that provided us with the right  but not the obligation  to sell all our auction rate securities to ubs  ag for par value during the period from june  to july  the ars put options 
the ars put options provided us with the opportunity to recover the estimated unrealized loss on our ars investments 
we recorded the fair value of the ars put options upon receipt 
we exercised these put options on june  with a settlement date of july  at december  we have no auction rate securities or put options in our investment portfolio 
we valued the auction rate securities and ars put options using a discounted cash flow model that weights various factors including interest rates and expected holding period 
unrealized gains and losses related to the ars put options were recognized in earnings 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based on an assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts 
the determination of risk for collection is assessed on a customer by customer basis considering our historical experience and future orders with the customer  changes in payment patterns  and recent information we have about the current status of our accounts receivable balances 
if we determine that a specific customer is a risk for collection  we provide a specific allowance for credit losses to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
we believe that based on the customers to whom we sell and the nature of our agreements with them  our estimates are reasonable 
our method of estimating collectability has remained consistent for all periods presented and with past collections experience 
stock based compensation 
we expense stock options based upon the fair market value on the date of grant 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model will be affected by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rates  forfeitures and expected dividends 
the expected term represents the weighted average period that our stock options are expected to be outstanding and is based upon the vesting term of our options  a review of a peer group of companies  and expected exercise behavior 
until november  we were operating as a private company  and as a result  we were unable to use our actual price volatility data 
therefore  we estimate the volatility of our common stock based on volatility of similar entities over the expected term of our stock options 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the option pricing model on us treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and  therefore  use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the current forfeiture rate of was based on our past history of pre vesting forfeitures and the forfeiture rate has remained constant 
we allocate stock based compensation costs using a straight line method which amortizes the fair value of each option on a straight line basis over the service period 
based on the variables affecting the valuation of our common stock and the method used for allocating compensation costs  we recognized million in stock based compensation expense during the year ended december  all option grants made during and were granted at an exercise price per share equal to the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
therefore  there is no intrinsic value because the exercise price per share of each option was equal to the fair value of the common stock on the date of grant 
based on the fair market value of the common stock at december   the intrinsic value for the options outstanding was  and the intrinsic value for the options exercisable was  at december   the intrinsic value for the options outstanding was  and the intrinsic value for

income tax valuation allowance 
evaluating the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets often requires significant judgment and extensive analysis of all the positive and negative evidence available to determine whether all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
a valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not a probability level of more than percent that they will not be realized 
in general  realization refers to the incremental benefit achieved through the reduction in future taxes payable or an increase in future taxes refundable from the deferred tax assets  assuming that the underlying deductible differences and carryforwards are the last items to enter into the determination of future taxable income 
in determining our valuation allowance  we consider the source of taxable income including taxable income in prior carryback years  future reversals of existing temporary differences  the required use of tax planning strategies  and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
we lack a consistent earnings history  including three years of cumulative losses 
in addition  pricing of our products has fluctuated wildly during our history and we will likely see continued price volatility 
while we generated pre tax earnings in  there is risk in meeting our financial goals 
we therefore concluded that a full valuation allowance should be maintained 
we will continue in to evaluate the evidence to determine whether all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
it is possible that we will release the valuation allowance within the next twelve months  which will favorably impact our results of operations in the period of the reversal
