results overview we saw continued growth during the fiscal year ended march   with product revenue growth of and overall revenue growth of compared to the prior fiscal year driven by strength in our enterprise and service provider sectors 
new business bookings increased by when compared to the prior fiscal year 
as 
table of contents the year progressed  we drove a return to growth in our broader enterprise sector that finished the year with a increase in new business bookings 
within the enterprise sector  financial services was strong with new business bookings up as financials recovered from the economic downturn 
new business from our service provider sector increased  which we expect to accelerate in fiscal as we support expanding g  lte network rollouts 
gross margin for fiscal year was  up one percentage point from fiscal year we did this in part through a shift towards higher margin products 
while operating expenses increased on higher sales and marketing expenses and incentive compensation  we improved our operating margin to for fiscal year  compared to for fiscal year net income and diluted net income per share increased and  respectively  in fiscal year through gross margin improvements compared to fiscal year we also achieved strong cash flow with cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities increasing to million at march  this represents an increase of million over the previous fiscal year ended march  use of non gaap financial measures from time to time in press releases regarding quarterly earnings  presentations and other communications  we may provide financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
recent non gaap financial measures have included non gaap revenue  income from operations  net income and net income per diluted share  each of which were adjusted from amounts determined based on gaap to exclude the effect of purchase accounting adjustments to acquired deferred revenue resulting from our acquisitions  and to eliminate the revenue impact of recently adopted accounting guidance  and to remove share based compensation expenses  certain business development expenses  integration expenses and the amortization of acquired intangible assets  net of related income tax effects 
management regularly uses supplemental non gaap financial measures internally to understand  manage and evaluate its business and to make operating decisions 
these non gaap measures are among the primary factors that management uses in planning and forecasting future periods 
management believes these non gaap financial measures enhance the reader s overall understanding of netscout s current financial performance and its prospects for the future by providing a higher degree of transparency for certain financial measures and providing a level of disclosure that helps investors understand how netscout plans and measures its business 
we believe that providing these non gaap measures affords investors a view of our operating results that may be more easily compared to our peer companies and against prior periods by enabling investors to consider our operating results on both a gaap and non gaap basis during periods where gaap results were affected by non recurring events  such as our acquisition of network general in these non gaap measures are not in accordance with gaap  should not be considered an alternative for measures prepared in accordance with gaap  and may have limitations in that they do not reflect all our results of operations as determined in accordance with gaap 
these non gaap measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding gaap measures 
the presentation of non gaap information is not meant to be considered superior to  in isolation from or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with gaap 

table of contents the following table reconciles revenue  net income and net income per share on a gaap and non gaap basis for the years ended march   and in thousands year ended march  gaap revenue impact of new accounting guidance deferred revenue fair value adjustment non gaap revenue gaap net income impact of new accounting guidance deferred revenue fair value adjustment share based compensation expense amortization of acquired intangible assets business development expenses integration expenses income tax adjustments non gaap net income gaap diluted net income per share share impact of non gaap adjustments identified above non gaap diluted net income per share critical accounting policies we consider accounting policies related to cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  revenue recognition  commission expense  uncollected deferred product revenue  valuation of inventories  assumptions related to purchase accounting  valuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets  capitalization of software development costs  derivative financial instruments  share based compensation and income taxes to be critical in fully understanding and evaluating our financial results 
the application of these policies involves significant judgments and estimates by us 
cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities we account for our investments in accordance with authoritative guidance 
under the provisions  we have classified our investments as available for sale which are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices and associated unrealized gains or losses are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized 
we consider all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents and those with maturities greater than three months are considered to be marketable securities 
cash and cash equivalents typically consist of money market instruments  commercial paper with a maturity of three months or less and cash maintained with various financial institutions 
marketable securities generally consist of us treasury bills  commercial paper with an original maturity of greater than three months  us government bonds  certificates of deposit  agency bonds  corporate bonds  auction rate securities and municipal bonds 
long term marketable securities consist of auction rate securities  us treasury bills  corporate bonds and certificates of deposit 
the auction rate securities we hold are all collateralized by student loans with underlying support by the federal government through the federal family education loan program ffelp and by monoline insurance companies 
auction rate securities typically were stated at par value prior to february due to liquidity provided through the auction process 
while we continue to earn interest on auction rate securities  the failure of these auctions has created illiquidity 
as a result  par value no longer approximates the 
table of contents estimated fair value of auction rate securities 
a discounted cash flow model was used to determine the estimated fair value of our investments in auction rate securities as of march  and the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  timing and amount of cash flows  a liquidity risk premium and expected holding periods of the investments 
based on this assessment of fair value  as of march  we have recorded a cumulative decline in the fair value of auction rate securities of million million net of tax which was deemed temporary 
assumptions used to value these securities and in determining the temporary nature of this impairment require significant judgment by management 
changes in the assumptions could result in materially different estimates of fair values and the failure of these securities to return to par value or a decision by management to sell these securities at a loss could have a material adverse impact on earnings 
revenue recognition in october  the fasb amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition to remove tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality from the scope of industry specific software revenue recognition guidance 
in october  the fasb also amended the accounting standards for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to i provide updated guidance on how the deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement should be separated  and how the consideration should be allocated  ii require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price or third party evidence of selling price  and iii eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
we elected to early adopt this accounting guidance at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal year on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originating or materially modified after april  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations for the fiscal year ended march  the following reflects our updated policy for revenue recognition 
product revenue consists of sales of our hardware products which include embedded software that works together with the hardware to deliver the product s essential functionality  licensing of our software products  and sale of hardware bundled with a software license 
product revenue is recognized upon shipment  provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
because many of our solutions are comprised of both hardware and more than incidental software components  we recognize our revenue in accordance with authoritative guidance on both hardware and software revenue recognition 
service revenue consists primarily of fees from customer support agreements  consulting and training 
we generally provide software and hardware support as part of product sales 
revenue related to the initial bundled software and hardware support is recognized ratably over the support period 
in addition  customers can elect to purchase extended support agreements for periods after the initial software warranty expiration  typically for month periods 
revenue from customer support agreements is recognized ratably over the support period 
revenue from consulting and training services is recognized as the work is performed 
multi element arrangements are concurrent customer purchases of a combination of our product and service offerings that may be delivered at various points in time 
for multi element arrangements comprised only of hardware products and related services  we allocate the total transaction revenue to the multiple elements based on each element s relative fair value compared to the total fair value of all the elements 
each element s relative 
table of contents fair value is based on management s best estimate of selling price besp paid by customers based on the element s historical pricing 
we review the sales of all products and services quarterly and update  when appropriate  our best estimate of selling price for each element to ensure that it reflects our recent pricing experience 
for multi element arrangements comprised only of software products and related services  we allocate a portion of the total purchase price to the undelivered elements  primarily support agreements and training  using vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements 
the remaining portion of the total transaction value is allocated to the delivered software  referred to as the residual method 
vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements is based on the price customers pay when the element is sold separately 
we review the separate sales of the undelivered elements on a quarterly basis and update  when appropriate  our vsoe of fair value for such elements to ensure that it reflects our recent pricing experience 
for multi element arrangements comprised of a combination of hardware and software elements  the total transaction value is bifurcated between the hardware elements and the software elements based on the relative selling prices of the hardware elements and the software elements as a group 
then  revenue for the hardware and hardware related services is recognized following the hardware revenue recognition methodology outlined above and revenue for the software and software related services is recognized following the residual method 
commission expense we recognize commission expense related to the renewal of maintenance contracts at the time an order is booked 
as a result  commission expense can be recognized in full even though the related revenue may not be fully recognized 
commission expense on product revenue and corresponding new maintenance contracts is recognized in the same period as the related product revenue  typically upon shipment 
uncollected deferred product revenue because of our revenue recognition policies  there are circumstances for which we are unable to recognize product revenue relating to sales transactions that have been shipped and billed 
while the receivable represents an enforceable obligation  for balance sheet presentation purposes we have not recognized the deferred revenue or the related account receivable and no amounts appear in our consolidated balance sheets for such transactions 
the aggregate amount of unrecognized accounts receivable and deferred revenue was thousand and million at march  and  respectively 
valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of actual cost or their net realizable value 
cost is determined by using the first in  first out fifo method 
inventories consist primarily of raw materials and finished goods 
inventory carrying values are reduced to our estimate of net realizable value 
we regularly monitor our inventories for potential obsolete and excess inventory 
our net realizable value adjustment is based upon our estimates of forecasts of unit sales  expected timing and impact of new product introductions  historical product demand  current economic trends  expected market acceptance of our products and expected customer buying patterns 
we adjust the carrying value of inventory to reflect its net realizable value when lower than original cost 
significant judgments and estimates are made when establishing the net realizable value adjustment 
if these accounting judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
valuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets the carrying value of goodwill was million as of march  and goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the enterprise level at least annually or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 

table of contents we consider the market capitalization of our outstanding common stock versus our stockholders equity as one indicator that may potentially trigger an impairment of goodwill analysis 
significant judgments and estimates are made when assessing impairment 
if these accounting judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  goodwill may be determined to be impaired and our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
likewise  if a future event or circumstance indicates that an impairment assessment is required and goodwill is determined to be impaired  our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
as of march   based upon our review  we determined that there has been no goodwill impairment 
the carrying value of acquired intangible assets was million and million as of march  and  respectively 
the carrying value of acquired intangible assets is recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition less accumulated amortization 
our acquired intangible assets include acquired software  customer relationships and an indefinite lived tradename resulting from the acquisition of network general on november  we amortize acquired intangible assets over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis  except for the acquired tradename which has an indefinite life and thus  is not amortized 
the carrying value of the indefinite lived sniffer tradename is evaluated for potential impairment on an annual basis 
at march   we determined that there had been no impairment of acquired intangible assets or indefinite lived assets 
significant judgment and estimates are made when estimating fair value and useful lives for acquired intangible assets 
if these accounting judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  the value of these assets and our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted 
we periodically review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
capitalization of software development costs costs incurred in the research and development of our products are expensed as incurred  except for certain software development costs 
costs associated with the development of computer software are expensed prior to establishment of technological feasibility and capitalized thereafter until the related software products are available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining the point at which technological feasibility has been met 
amortization of capitalized software development costs begin once projects are ready for sale to the general public and are charged to cost of revenue on a straight line basis over two years 
capitalized software development costs are periodically assessed for recoverability in the event of changes to the anticipated future revenue for the software products or changes in product technologies 
unamortized capitalized software development costs that are determined to be in excess of the net realizable value of the software products would be expensed in the period in which such a determination is made 
derivative financial instruments under authoritative guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities  all hedging activities must be documented at the inception of the hedge and must meet the definition of highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows in order for the derivative to qualify for hedge accounting 
under the guidance  if an instrument qualifies for hedge accounting  the changes in the fair value each period for open contracts  measured as of the end of the period  are recorded to other comprehensive income 
otherwise  changes in the fair value are recorded in earnings each period 
management must perform initial and ongoing tests in order to qualify for hedge accounting 
in accordance with the guidance  we account for our instruments under hedge accounting 
the effectiveness and a measurement of ineffectiveness of qualifying hedge contracts is assessed by netscout quarterly 
we record the fair value of derivatives hedges in other current assets and other current liabilities 
the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of qualifying hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income loss until the forecasted transaction occurs  with any ineffective portion classified directly to our consolidated statement of operations based on the expense categories of the items being hedged 
when forecasted transactions occur  unrealized gains or losses associated with the effective portion of the hedge 
table of contents are reclassified to the respective expense categories in our consolidated statement of operations 
gains or losses related to hedging activity are included as operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
if the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur  or it becomes probable that they will not occur  the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge is recognized immediately in earnings 
further information relative to our derivative instruments is disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments 
under the fair value recognition provisions  we recognize share based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
based on historical experience  we assumed an annualized forfeiture rate of for awards granted to our directors  and an annualized forfeiture rate of for awards granted to our senior executives and remaining employees 
we will record additional expense if the actual forfeitures are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior expense if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated 
income taxes significant judgments and estimates are made when calculating our annual provision for income taxes 
in addition  we may record certain tax reserves to address potential exposures involving our tax positions 
our estimate of the value of our tax reserves contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes  rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions 
if these judgments and estimates prove to be materially inaccurate  our tax rate could fluctuate significantly and our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in the future 
we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of these assets and liabilities as well as on acquired or incurred net operating loss carryforward amounts 
we make an assessment of the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent that recovery is not believed to be more likely than not  a valuation allowance is established 
all available evidence  both positive and negative  is considered in the determination of recording a valuation allowance 
we consider past performance  future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies when assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
these standards clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
a two step approach is utilized for evaluating tax positions 
recognition step occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is not more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
measurement step is only addressed if step has been satisfied 
under step  the tax benefit is measured at the largest amount of benefit  determined on a cumulative probability basis  that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement 
as used in the accounting standards  the term more likely than not means that the likelihood of an occurrence is greater than 

table of contents results of operations comparison of years ended march  and march  revenue product revenue consists of sales of our hardware products and licensing of our software products

the  or million  increase in product revenue was due to an million increase in our enterprise business sector and a million increase in our service provider sector 
compared to our previous fiscal year  we realized an increase of approximately in the average selling price per unit of our products offset by a decrease in units shipped 
the increase in selling price per unit is due to a shift in product mix towards our higher capacity infinistream products 
the decrease in units shipped was also due to product mix 
service 
the  or million  increase in service revenue was due in part to a million increase in revenue from maintenance contracts due to increased renewals from a growing support base  a million increase in revenue from post contract customer support in connection with product revenue growth  and an thousand increase in other service revenue largely due to on site revenue 
in addition  there was a decline of million in purchase accounting adjustments to deferred service revenue associated with our acquisition of network general 
as a result of this acquisition  acquired deferred revenue was reduced to fair value to eliminate selling profit from the contracts that were acquired from network general 
as the fair value adjusted deferred revenue has amortized over time  it comprised a smaller proportion of total maintenance revenue during the fiscal year ended march  subsequent maintenance renewal contracts are recorded at their full value and thus result in higher recorded revenue 
we also recognized million in training and consulting revenue during the fiscal year ended march  from non refundable expired contracts 
in prior years  we had not been able to demonstrate that we had fulfilled our obligations 
however  starting with the quarter ended june   we were able to demonstrate that our obligations had been fulfilled related to the non refundable expired contracts 
while we will continue to recognize revenue from non refundable contracts  we do not expect the revenue in future quarters to be significant

our reported international revenue does not include any revenue from sales to customers outside the united states that are shipped to our united states based indirect channel partners 
these domestic resellers fulfill customer orders based upon joint selling efforts in conjunction with our direct sales force and may subsequently ship our products to international locations  however  we report these shipments as united states revenue since we ship the products to a domestic location 
the  or million  increase in direct channel revenue and change in sales mix between direct and indirect is primarily the result of increased domestic revenue from our service provider and enterprise sectors  as well as the million reduction in purchase accounting adjustments related to the network general acquisition which had the effect of increasing revenue

this decline was partially offset by growth in our service provider sector of million 
while product bookings increased over fiscal year we entered with significant backlog which allowed for higher revenue in fiscal year on lower bookings

we also generated million of product revenue from our new lower capacity infinistream product launched during the year 
product revenue recognized during the year ended march  reflected a million purchase accounting adjustment that was made to reduce acquired deferred product revenue to fair value as a result of the network general acquisition 
the impact of purchase accounting adjustments was not material for fiscal year product revenue as a percent of total revenue decreased three percentage points when compared to the year ended march  service 
the  or million  increase in service revenue was due to the renewal of maintenance contracts associated with the acquired network general business at full value  while deferred revenue acquired in november and subsequently recognized into revenue had been reduced to fair value as required under purchase accounting 
this adjustment to service revenue was million lower in fiscal year than it was in fiscal year this was offset by a million decrease in maintenance revenue due to a portion of our customers not renewing their customer support agreements as well as netscout ending support for some of our older product models

liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities consist of the following in thousands as of march  cash and cash equivalents short term marketable securities long term marketable securities cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at march   we had a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders led by keybank national association keybank which allows us to borrow up to million for working capital purposes and to obtain letters of credit subject to a sublimit 
amounts outstanding under the facility bear interest at a floating interest rate dependent upon  at our election  libor or keybank s prime rate  in each case plus a margin  and are collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
under the agreement  we are required to comply with certain financial covenants which require that we maintain minimum certain amounts of liquidity  the most restrictive of which are a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of no less than to and a maximum leverage ratio of less than to 
as of march   we were in compliance with such covenants 
as of march   no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities increased by million from march  to march  while cash and cash equivalents increased by million  short and long term marketable securities increased in total by million 
these increases were the result of cash flow from operations 
our long term marketable securities include investments in auction rate securities 
beginning in february and continuing through march   auctions have failed resulting in a lack of short term liquidity for these securities  which has caused us to classify million as long term on our consolidated balance sheet 
the remaining million was reported as short term reflecting the redemption of one of our holdings at par value on april  as of march   our auction rate securities consisted of four positions issued by municipal agencies with a total par value of million and a current estimated market value totaling million 
the auction rate securities held by netscout at march  have maturity dates ranging from december through june as of march   the portion of these securities reported as long term 
table of contents were all aaa rated 
these securities are collateralized by student loans with underlying support by the federal government through the ffelp and by monoline insurance companies 
we have the ability and intent to hold these securities until a recovery in the auction process or other liquidity event occurs 
the fair value of these securities has been estimated by management based on the assumptions disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  subsequent to our fiscal year ended march  a total of million of auction rate securities were redeemed at par value  providing liquidity for a portion of these securities 
we will continue to analyze our auction rate securities each reporting period for impairment  and we may be required to record an impairment charge in the consolidated statement of operations if the decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary 
the estimated fair value of our auction rate securities could change significantly based on market and economic conditions  including changes in market rates  the estimated timing until a liquidity event  the discount factor associated with illiquidity and the credit ratings of our securities 
there is no assurance as to when liquidity will return to this investment class  and therefore  we continue to monitor and evaluate these securities 
based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not expect the lack of liquidity in these investments to affect our ability to execute our current business plan

liquidity we believe that our cash balances  short term marketable securities classified as available for sale and future cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures and scheduled principal and interest payments on our debt for at least the next months 
if demand for our product were to decrease substantially  our ability to generate cash flow sufficient for our short term working capital and expenditure needs could be materially impacted 
additionally  a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we evaluate potential acquisitions of such businesses  products or technologies such as our acquisition of network general 
if our existing sources of liquidity are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  we announced the acquisition of psytechnics  ltd

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our primary market risk exposures are in the areas of illiquidity of auction rate securities  interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we currently do not hedge 
table of contents interest rate exposure  but do not believe that a fluctuation in interest rates would have a material impact on the value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities 
our long term marketable securities  which consist primarily of auction rate securities  are stated at fair value based on risk adjusted discounted cash flow calculations 
prior to february  these securities typically were stated at par value 
while we continue to earn interest on auction rate securities at the maximum contractual rate  these securities are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value 
accordingly  par value no longer approximates the estimated fair value of auction rate securities 
as a result of their illiquidity  we have recorded a temporary impairment at march  against the carrying value of our auction rate securities 
for more information on auction rate securities  refer to note credit risk 
our cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of money market instruments  us treasury bills  certificates of deposit  commercial paper  corporate bonds  municipal obligations and student loan backed auction rate securities 
at march  and periodically throughout the year  we have maintained cash balances in various operating accounts in excess of federally insured limits 
we limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution by evaluating the creditworthiness of the financial institutions with which we invest 
interest rate risk 
we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates related to our term loan 
as of march   we owed million on this loan with an interest rate of effective march  through september   the next libor reset date 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on the outstanding portion of our debt obligation as of march  should the current weighted average interest rate increase or decrease by  the resulting annual increase or decrease to interest expense would be approximately thousand as of march  when a sensitivity analysis was performed at march   the resulting annual increase or decrease to interest expense was thousand 
foreign currency exchange risk 
as a result of our foreign operations  we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the euro  british pound  canadian dollar and indian rupee 
the current exposures arise primarily from expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
netscout currently engages in foreign currency hedging activities in order to limit these exposures 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
as of march   we had foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts totaling million 
the valuation of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts at march  resulted in a liability balance of thousand  reflecting unfavorable contract rates in comparison to current market rates at this date and an asset balance of thousand reflecting favorable rates in comparison to current market rates
