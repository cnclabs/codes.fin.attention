item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in millions  except per share data management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is designed to provide a reader of american capital agency corp 
financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management 
our md a is presented in five sections executive overview financial condition results of operations liquidity and capital resources forward looking statements executive overview we are a reit that invests exclusively in residential mortgage pass through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations on a leveraged basis 
these investments consist of securities for which principal and interest are guaranteed by government sponsored entities such as fannie mae and freddie mac  or by a us government agency such as ginnie mae 
we refer to these types of securities as agency securities and the specific agency securities in which we invest as our investment portfolio 
we were organized on january   and commenced operations on may  following the completion of our ipo 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol agnc 
we are externally managed by american capital agency management  llc our manager 
our manager is a majority owned subsidiary of american capital  llc  which is a wholly owned portfolio company of american capital 
we do not have any employees 
our principal objective is to preserve our net asset value while generating attractive risk adjusted returns for distribution to our stockholders through regular quarterly dividends from our net interest income  which is the spread between the interest income earned on our investment portfolio and the interest costs of our borrowings and hedging activities  and net realized gains and losses on our investments and other supplemental hedging activities 
we fund our investments through short term borrowings structured as repurchase agreements 
since our ipo  we have declared or paid dividends of per share 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
as long as we qualify as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our taxable income to stockholders 
as of december  and  we had total assets of billion and billion  respectively 
our investment portfolio of billion at fair value  as of december   consisted of billion of fixed rate agency securities  billion of adjustable rate agency securities and billion of cmos backed by fixed and adjustable rate agency securities 
our investment portfolio of billion at fair value  as of december   consisted of billion of fixed rate agency securities  billion of adjustable rate agency securities and billion of cmos backed by fixed and adjustable rate agency securities 
our repurchase agreements and other debt outstanding were billion and billion and our stockholders equity was billion and billion  or per share and per share  for a leverage ratio  including the net liability for unsettled agency securities  of times and times our stockholders equity as of december  and  respectively 
we reported net income of million and million  or and per basic and diluted share  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
financing spreads earned on our investment portfolio the difference between yields on our investments and rates on related borrowings  including amortization expense related to terminated swaps averaged and during the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents the size and composition of our investment portfolio depends on investment strategies implemented by our manager  the availability of investment capital and overall market conditions  including the availability of attractively priced investments and suitable financing to appropriately leverage our investment portfolio 
market conditions are influenced by  among other things  current levels of and expectations for future levels of  interest rates  mortgage prepayments  market liquidity and government participation in the market 
summary of critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies relate to our investments  recognition of interest income  repurchase agreements  derivative and other hedging instruments and income taxes 
each of these items involves estimates that will require management to make judgments that are subjective in nature 
we rely on our manager s experience and analysis of historical and current market data in order to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates 
under different conditions  we could report materially different amounts using these critical accounting policies 
investments in agency securities asc topic  investments debt and equity securities asc  requires that at the time of purchase  we designate a security as held to maturity  available for sale or trading depending on our ability and intent to hold such security to maturity 
securities classified as trading and available for sale are reported at fair value  while securities classified as held to maturity are reported at amortized cost 
we may  from time to time  sell any of our agency securities as part of our overall management of our investment portfolio 
accordingly  we typically designate our agency securities as available for sale 
all securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income oci  a component of stockholders equity 
upon the sale of a security  we determine the cost of the security and the amount of unrealized gains or losses to reclassify out of accumulated oci into earnings based on the specific identification method 
interest only strips represent our right to receive a specified proportion of the contractual interest flows of specific agency and cmo securities 
interest only strips are measured at fair value through earnings in gain loss on derivative instruments and trading securities  net in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
our investments in interest only strips are included in agency securities  at fair value on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we estimate the fair value of our agency securities based on a market approach using level inputs from third party pricing services and dealer quotes 
the third party pricing services use pricing models that incorporate such factors as coupons  primary and secondary mortgage rates  prepayment speeds  spread to the treasury and interest rate swap curves  convexity  duration  periodic and life caps and credit enhancements 
the dealer quotes incorporate common market pricing methods  including a spread measurement to the treasury or interest rate swap curve as well as underlying characteristics of the particular security including coupon  periodic and life caps  rate reset period  issuer  additional credit support and expected life of the security 
management reviews the fair values determined by the third party pricing models and dealer quotes and compares the results  if available  to values from the repurchase agreement counterparties and internal pricing models on each investment to validate reasonableness 
we evaluate securities for other than temporary impairment otti on at least a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such evaluation 
based on the criteria in asc  the determination of whether a security is other than temporarily impaired involves judgments and assumptions based on subjective and objective factors 
when an agency security is impaired  an otti is considered to have occurred if i we intend to sell the agency security i 
e a decision has been made as of the reporting date or ii it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the agency security before recovery of its amortized cost 
table of contents basis 
if we intend to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the agency security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  the entire amount of the impairment loss  if any  is recognized in earnings as a realized loss and the cost basis of the security is adjusted to its fair value 
we did not recognize any other than temporary impairment on any of our agency securities for fiscal years and and for the period from may  through december  interest income interest income is accrued based on the outstanding principal amount of the agency securities and their contractual terms 
premiums and discounts associated with the purchase of agency securities are amortized or accreted into interest income over the projected lives of the securities  including contractual payments and estimated prepayments using the interest method in accordance with asc subtopic  receivables nonrefundable fees and other costs asc 
we estimate long term prepayment speeds using third party services and market data 
these third party services estimate prepayment speeds using models that incorporate the forward yield curve  current mortgage rates  current mortgage rates of the outstanding loans  loan age  volatility and other factors 
we review the prepayment speeds estimated by the third party services and compare the results to market consensus prepayment speeds  if available 
we also consider historical prepayment speeds and current market conditions to validate the reasonableness of the prepayment speeds estimated by the third party services 
actual and anticipated prepayment experience is reviewed quarterly and effective yields are recalculated when differences arise between the previously estimated future prepayment and the amounts actually received plus current anticipated future prepayments 
if the actual and anticipated future prepayment experience differs from our prior estimate of prepayments  we are required to recognize a catch up adjustment in the current period to the amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts for the impact of the cumulative change in the effective yield through the reporting date 
in addition  pursuant to asc  the yield on our adjustable rate securities assumes that the securities reset at a rate equal to the underlying index rate in effect as of the date we acquired the security plus the stated margin 
consequently  future reset rate assumptions incorporated in our asset yields may differ materially from future reset rates implied by the forward yield curve and the actual reset rates ultimately achieved 
further  notwithstanding changes to our actual and projected cpr assumptions  the lower our reset rate assumption is pursuant to asc than the current fixed rate in effect  the greater the rate of premium amortization we will recognize over the initial fixed rate period 
our adjustable rate portfolio was acquired for a premium above par value and most securities were acquired during a period of historically low index rates 
accordingly  the majority of the premium balance on our adjustable rate securities will be amortized prior to their first reset date  regardless of actual or forecasted prepayment speeds and changes in the underlying index rates prior to actual reset 
adjustable rate securities acquired during a different interest rate environment may experience a different premium amortization pattern even as current index rates remain near their historical lows 
repurchase agreements we finance the acquisition of agency securities for our investment portfolio through repurchase transactions under master repurchase agreements 
pursuant to asc topic  transfers and servicing asc  we account for repurchase transactions as collateralized financing transactions which are carried at their contractual amounts  including accrued interest  as specified in the respective transactions 
repurchase agreements are carried at cost which approximates fair value due to their short term nature 

table of contents derivative and other hedging instruments we maintain a risk management strategy  under which we use a variety of strategies to hedge some of our exposure to interest rate risk 
the objective of our risk management strategy is to reduce fluctuations in book value and generate additional income distributable to stockholders 
in particular  we attempt to mitigate the risk of the cost of our variable rate liabilities increasing during a period of rising interest rates 
the principal instruments that we use are interest rate swaps and options to enter into interest rate swaps interest rate swaptions 
we also purchase or short tba and us treasury securities  purchase or write put or call options on tba securities and invest in other types of mortgage derivatives  such as interest only strips 
we account for derivative instruments in accordance with asc topic  derivatives and hedging asc 
asc requires and entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet and to measure those instruments at fair value 
hedging instruments that are not derivatives under asc  are accounted for in accordance with asc the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
derivatives that are intended to hedge exposure to variability in expected future cash flows are considered cash flow hedges 
for derivatives designated in qualifying cash flow hedging relationships  the effective portion of the fair value adjustments is initially recorded in oci a component of stockholders equity and reclassified to income at the time that the hedged transactions affect earnings 
the ineffective portion of the fair value adjustments is immediately recognized in gain loss on derivative instruments and trading securities  net 
when the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist  any amounts that have been previously recorded in accumulated oci would be reclassified to net income and all subsequent changes in the fair value of the instrument would be included in gain loss on derivative instruments and trading securities  net for each period until the derivative instrument matures or is settled 
for derivatives not designated in hedging relationships under asc  the fair value adjustments are recorded in gain loss on derivative instruments and trading securities  net 
derivatives in a gain position are reported as derivative assets at fair value and derivatives in a loss position are reported as derivative liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet 
in our consolidated statements of cash flows  cash receipts and payments related to derivative instruments are classified according to the underlying nature or purpose of the derivative transaction  generally in the operating section for derivatives designated in hedging relationships and the investing section for derivatives not designated in hedging relationships 
the use of derivatives creates exposure to credit risk relating to potential losses that could be recognized in the event that the counterparties to these instruments fail to perform their obligations under the contracts 
we attempt to minimize this risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings and monitoring positions with individual counterparties 
interest rate swap agreements we use interest rate swaps to hedge the variable cash flows associated with short term borrowings made under our repurchase agreement facilities 
we generally enter into such derivatives with the intention of qualifying for hedge accounting under asc we estimate the fair value of interest rate swaps based on inputs from a third party pricing model 
the third party pricing model incorporates such factors as the treasury curve  libor rates  the pay rate on the interest rate swaps 
we also incorporate both our own and our counterparties nonperformance risk in estimating the fair value of our interest rate swap and swaption agreements 
in considering the effect of nonperformance risk  we consider the impact of netting and credit enhancements  such as collateral postings and guarantees  and have concluded that our own and our counterparty risk is not significant to the overall valuation of these agreements 

table of contents interest rate swaptions we may purchase interest rate swaptions to help mitigate the potential impact of increases or decreases in interest rates on the performance of our investment portfolio referred to as convexity risk 
the interest rate swaptions provide us the option to enter into an interest rate swap agreement for a predetermined notional amount  stated term and pay and receive interest rates in the future 
the premium paid for interest rate swaptions is reported as an asset in our consolidated balance sheets 
the premium is valued at an amount equal to the fair value of the swaption that would have the effect of closing the position adjusted for nonperformance risk  if any 
the difference between the premium and the fair value of the swaption is reported in gain loss on derivative instruments and trading securities  net in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income 
if a swaption expires unexercised  the loss on the swaption would be equal to the premium paid 
if we exercise a swaption  the realized gain or loss on the swaption would be equal to the difference between the fair value of the underlying interest rate swap and the premium paid 
we estimate the fair value of interest rate swaptions based on the fair value of the future interest rate swap that we have the option to enter into as well as the remaining length of time that we have to exercise the option 
tba securities a tba security is a futures contract for the purchase or sale of agency securities at a predetermined price  face amount  issuer  coupon and stated maturity on an agreed upon future date 
the specific agency securities delivered into the contract upon the settlement date  published each month by the securities industry and financial markets association  are not known at the time of the transaction 
tba securities are exempt from asc and are accounted for under asc if there is no other way to purchase or sell that security  if delivery of that security and settlement will occur within the shortest period possible for that type of security and if it is probable at inception and throughout the term of the individual contract that physical delivery of the security will occur referred to as the regular way exception 
alternatively  we may designate the tba security as a qualifying cash flow hedge under asc if the regular way exception is not met and at the time of the purchase or sale of the security  and throughout the term of the individual contract  it is probable that the forecasted transaction will occur and the hedging relationship is expected to be highly effective 
for tba security contracts that we have entered into  we have generally not asserted that physical settlement is probable or that the forecasted transaction is probable of occurring and  therefore  we typically have not designated these forward commitments as hedging instruments 
realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with tba contracts not subject to the regular way exception or not designated as hedging instruments are recognized in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income in the line item gain loss on derivative instruments and trading securities  net 
we estimate the fair value of tba securities based on similar methods used to value agency securities 
put and call options on tba securities we may purchase put and call options on tba securities to hedge against short term changes in interest rates 
under a purchased put option  we have the right to sell to the counterparty a specified tba security at a predetermined price on the option exercise date in exchange for a premium at execution 
under a purchased call option  we have the right to purchase from the counterparty a specified tba security at a predetermined price on the option exercise date in exchange for a premium at execution 
the premium paid for a put or call option is reported as an asset in our consolidated balance sheets 
the premium is valued at an amount equal to the fair value of the option that would have the effect of closing the position adjusted for nonperformance risk  if any 
the difference between the premium and the fair value of the option is reported in gain loss on derivative instruments and trading securities  net in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income 
when a purchased put or call option expires unexercised  a realized loss is reported in our consolidated statement of operations equal to the premium paid 
when a purchased put or call option is exercised  a realized gain or loss 
table of contents is reported in our consolidated statement of operations equal to the difference between the premium paid and the fair value of the exercised put or call option 
in addition  a derivative asset is recorded in our consolidated balance sheet for the tba security resulting from the put or call option exercise 
we may also write put and call options on tba securities 
under a written put option  the counterparty has the right to sell us a specified tba security at a predetermined price on the option exercise date in exchange for a premium at execution 
under a written call option  the counterparty has the right to purchase from us a specified tba security at a predetermined price on the option exercise date in exchange for a premium at execution 
the premium received from writing a put or call option is reported as a liability in our consolidated balance sheets 
the premium is valued at an amount equal to the fair value of the option that would have the effect of closing the position adjusted for nonperformance risk  if any 
the difference between the premium and the fair value of the option is reported in gain loss on derivative instruments and trading securities  net in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income 
when a written put or call option expires unexercised  a realized gain is reported in our consolidated statement of operations equal to the premium received 
when we terminate a written put or call option  a realized gain or loss is reported in our consolidated statement of operations equal to the difference between the termination payment and the premium received 
when a written put or call option is exercised  a realized gain or loss is reported in our consolidated statement of operations equal to the difference between the premium received and the fair value of the exercised put or call option 
in addition  a derivative asset or liability is recorded in our consolidated balance sheet for the tba security resulting from the put or call option exercise 
we estimate the fair value of put and call options on tba securities based on the fair value of the underlying tba security as well as the remaining length of time to exercise the option 
forward commitments to purchase or sell specified agency securities we may enter into a forward commitment to purchase or sell specified agency securities as a means of acquiring assets or as a hedge against short term changes in interest rates 
contracts for the purchase or sale of specified agency securities are accounted for as derivatives if the delivery of the specified agency security and settlement extends beyond the shortest period possible for that type of security 
we may designate the forward commitment as a qualifying cash flow hedge if at the time of the purchase or sale of the security  and throughout the term of the individual contract  it is probable that physical delivery of the security will occur 
realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with forward commitments not designated as hedging instruments are recognized in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income in the line item gain loss on derivative instruments and trading securities  net 
we estimate the fair value of forward commitments to purchase or sell specified agency securities based on similar methods used to value agency securities as well as the remaining length of time of the forward commitment 
us treasury securities we may purchase or short us treasury securities to help mitigate the potential impact of changes in interest rates on the performance of our portfolio 
we may borrow securities to cover short sales of us treasury securities under reverse repurchase agreements 
we account for these as securities borrowing transactions and recognize an obligation to return the borrowed securities at fair value on the balance sheet based on the value of the underlying borrowed securities as of the reporting date 
realized and unrealized gains and losses associated purchases and short sales of treasury securities are recognized in gains losses on derivative instruments and trading securities  net in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income

the stated contractual final maturity of the mortgage loans underlying our portfolio of agency securities ranges up to years  but the expected maturity is subject to change based on the actual and expected future prepayments of the underlying loans 
as of december  and  the average final contractual maturity of the agency securities in our investment portfolio was and years  respectively 
the estimated weighted average months to maturity of the agency securities in the tables below are based upon our prepayment expectations  which are estimated based on assumptions for different securities using a combination of third party services  market data and internal models 
the third party services estimate prepayment speeds using models that incorporate the forward yield curve  mortgage rates  current mortgage rates of the outstanding loans  loan age  volatility and other factors 
as market conditions are changing rapidly  we use judgment in making adjustments to our models for some products 
various market participants could use materially different assumptions 
the following tables summarize our agency securities  at fair value  according to their estimated weighted average life classifications as of december  and in thousands as of december  as of december  less than one year greater than or equal to one year and less than three years greater than or equal to three years and less than five years greater than or equal to five years total the constant prepayment rate cpr reflects the percentage of principal that is prepaid over a period of time on an annualized basis 
in general  while there are various factors that impact the rate of prepayments  as interest rates rise  the rate of refinancings typically declines  which may result in lower rates of prepayment and  as a result  a lower portfolio cpr 
conversely  as interest rates fall  the rate of refinancings typically increases  which may result in higher rates of prepayment and  as a result  a higher portfolio cpr 
as of december   our portfolio was purchased at a net premium 
in determining the estimated weighted average months to maturity of our agency securities and the yield on our agency securities  we have assumed that the cpr over the remaining projected life of our aggregate investment portfolio is as of december  we make different prepayment assumptions for the individual securities that comprise the investment portfolio and these individual assumptions can differ 
table of contents materially from the average 
there is also considerable uncertainty around prepayment speeds in this environment and actual speeds could differ materially from our estimates 
furthermore  us government agency or us government entity buyouts of loans in imminent risk of default  loans that have been modified  or loans that have defaulted will generally be reflected as prepayments on agency securities and also increase the uncertainty around these estimates 
in addition  securities were purchased with different amounts of premiums and therefore the yield on some securities is more sensitive to changes in prepayment speeds 

table of contents results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year interest income and asset yield interest income increased to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year this was due to a increase in our average investment portfolio  partially offset by a decline in our average asset yield from fiscal year our average asset yield declined to for fiscal year from for fiscal year as a result of acquiring lower yielding securities due to changes in our portfolio composition and increase in the size of our average investment portfolio during a period of lower interest rates than of the prior year 
the average coupon of our investment portfolio declined to for fiscal year from for fiscal year the average amortized cost basis of our investment portfolio increased to for fiscal year from for the prior year 
we amortize premiums and discounts associated with agency securities into interest income over the life of such securities using the effective yield method 
the effective yield or asset yield on our agency securities is based on actual cprs realized for individual securities in our investment portfolio through the reporting date and assumes a cpr over the remaining projected life of our aggregate investment portfolio of and as of december  and  respectively 
the actual cpr realized for individual securities in our investment portfolio was approximately and for fiscal years and  respectively 
in addition  pursuant to asc  the yield on our adjustable rate securities assumes that the securities reset at a rate equal to the underlying index rate in effect as of the date we acquired the security plus the stated margin 
consequently  future reset rate assumptions incorporated in our asset yields may differ materially from future reset rates implied by the forward yield curve and the actual reset rates ultimately achieved 
further  notwithstanding changes to our actual and projected cpr assumptions  the lower our reset rate assumption is pursuant to asc than the current fixed rate in effect  the greater the rate of premium amortization we will recognize over the initial fixed rate period 
our adjustable rate portfolio was acquired for a premium above par value and most securities were acquired during a period of historically low index rates 
accordingly  the majority of the premium balance on our adjustable rate securities will be amortized prior to their first reset date  regardless of actual or forecasted prepayment speeds and changes in the underlying index rates prior to actual reset 
adjustable rate securities acquired during a different interest rate environment may experience a different premium amortization pattern even as current index rates remain near their historical lows 
for adjustable rate securities held as of december   the weighted average coupon rate was  the weighted average months to reset was months and the weighted average reset rate assumption was  which is based on a weighted average underlying index rate of as of the date we acquired the securities and a weighted average margin of 
interest income for fiscal years and is net of million and million  respectively  for net amortization of premiums and discounts on our investment portfolio

leverage our leverage as of december  and was and times  respectively  our stockholders equity 
when adjusted for the net payable for agency securities purchased but not yet settled  our leverage ratio was and times our stockholders equity as of december  and  respectively 
our actual leverage will vary from time to time based on various factors  including our manager s opinion of the level of risk of our assets and liabilities  our liquidity position  our level of unused borrowing capacity  over collateralization levels required by lenders when we pledge agency securities to secure our borrowings and the 
table of contents current market value of our investment portfolio 
in addition  certain of our master repurchase agreements and master swap agreements contain a restriction that prohibits our leverage from exceeding levels ranging from to times the amount of our stockholders equity 
the table below presents our quarterly average and quarter end repurchase agreement and other debt balance outstanding and leverage ratios for the fiscal years ended december  and dollars in thousands repurchase agreements and other debt quarter ended average daily amount outstanding maximum daily amount outstanding ending amount outstanding average daily interest rate on amounts outstanding average interest rate on ending amount outstanding average leverage leverage as of period end leverage as of period end  net of unsettled trades march  june  september  december  march  june  september  december  average leverage during the period was calculated by dividing our average repurchase agreements and other debt outstanding for the period by our average stockholders equity for the period 
leverage as of period end was calculated by dividing the amount outstanding under our repurchase agreements and other debt by our stockholders equity at period end 
leverage as of period end  net of unsettled trades was calculated by dividing the sum of the amount outstanding under our repurchase agreements  net liabilities and receivables for unsettled agency securities and other debt by our total stockholders equity at period end 
our average leverage as of december   net of unsettled trades  of times our stockholders equity was less than our average leverage for the quarter ended december  because we had not fully invested the net proceeds raised from our december follow on equity offering as of the end of the year 
interest expense and cost of funds interest expense was million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in interest was due to an increase in our average repurchase agreements and other debt outstanding  partially offset by a decline our total cost of funds as described below 
for fiscal years and  average repurchase agreements and other debt outstanding were billion and billion  respectively 
the increase in the average repurchase agreement and other debt balance over fiscal year was primarily driven by deploying new equity capital raised during the periods on a levered basis 
the average interest rate on our repurchase agreements and other debt declined to for fiscal year from for the prior year  primarily driven by the decline in the one month libor interest rate 
including the net impact of interest rate swaps  the total average cost of funds for fiscal years and declined to from  respectively or to from when excluding amortization expense associated with previously terminated interest rate swaps

outstanding designated interest rate swaps were and of the outstanding balance under our repurchase agreements and other debt as of december  and  respectively 
for fiscal years and  our designated interest rate swaps increased the cost of our borrowings by million and million or million and million excluding amortization expense associated with the termination of interest rate swaps  respectively  which equaled and or and excluding terminated swap amortization expense of interest bearing liabilities  respectively 

table of contents we did not terminate any interest rate swaps accounted for as hedges under asc during fiscal year during fiscal year  we terminated interest rate swaps with notional amounts of million  resulting in net settlement payments of million  equal to their fair value on the date of termination 
the net settlements were amortized into income over the remaining life of the terminated interest rate swaps through the second quarter of and included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
amortization expense for the terminated swaps was million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
net interest income and net interest rate spread net interest income  which equals interest income less interest expense  was million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
the average net interest rate spread  which equals the average yield on our assets for the period less the average cost of funds for the period  was and or and excluding terminated swap amortization expense for fiscal years and  respectively 
as of december   the net interest rate spread was 
the decrease in our average net interest rate spread was due to a decline in our average asset yield  partially offset by a decrease in our cost of funds  as discussed above

our strategy for the periods presented was largely focused on repositioning our portfolio towards securities with attributes our manager believes reduce the level of prepayment risk in light of current and anticipated interest rates  federal government programs  general economic conditions and other factors

the increase in the net gains from derivatives and trading securities for fiscal year over fiscal year is due to an increase in the size our investment portfolio coupled with an increase in the use of other supplemental hedging strategies entered into to manage the potential adverse impact of short term changes in interest rates on the value of our investments and our cash flows 
net gains from derivatives and trading securities for fiscal year benefited particularly during the fourth quarter of  which  given the increase in interest rates we experienced during december of  resulted in a significant amount of net gains from our use of other supplemental hedging strategies 
further details regarding our derivatives and related hedging activity for the years ended december  and are discussed in notes and to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
management fees and general and administrative expenses we pay our manager a base management fee payable monthly in arrears in amount equal to one twelfth of of our equity 
our equity is defined as our month end stockholders equity  adjusted to exclude the effect of any unrealized gains or losses included in either retained earnings or oci  each as computed in accordance with gaap 
there is no incentive compensation payable to our manager pursuant to the management agreement 
we incurred management fees of million and million during fiscal years and  respectively 

table of contents general and administrative expenses were million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
our general and administrative expenses primarily consisted of the allocation of overhead expenses from our manager  information technology costs  prime broker fees  accounting fees  legal fees  board of director fees and insurance expenses 
our total expenses as a percentage of our average stockholders equity declined to for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year due to improved operating leverage 
income taxes as a reit  we are subject to a nondeductible federal excise tax of to the extent that the sum of i of our ordinary taxable income  ii of our capital gains and iii any undistributed taxable income from the prior year exceeds our distributions paid in such year 
for fiscal years and  we accrued a federal excise tax of million and million  respectively  because our calendar year distributions were less than the total of these amounts 
however  we did distribute all of our taxable income for fiscal year and expect to distribute all our remaining taxable income for fiscal year to our stockholders as required for a reit so that we would not be subject to any federal income tax 
net income and net return on equity net income was million  or per basic and diluted share  and million  or per basic and diluted share  for fiscal years and  respectively 
for fiscal year  the annualized net return on average equity was  or excluding other income  net and excise tax compared to an annualized net return on average equity of  or excluding other income  net and excise tax for fiscal year dividends for fiscal years and  we declared dividends of per share and per share  respectively 
as a reit  we are required to distribute annually of our taxable income to maintain our status a reit and all of our taxable income to avoid federal  state and local corporate income taxes 
we can treat dividends declared by september and paid by december as having been a distribution of our taxable income for our prior tax year 
as of december   we have distributed all of our taxable income for the tax year and we have million of undistributed taxable income related to our tax year  net of the december  dividend payable of million 
income as determined under gaap differs from income as determined under tax rules because of both temporary and permanent differences in income and expense recognition 
examples include temporary differences related to unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments and trading securities that are recognized in income for gaap but are excluded from taxable income until realized or settled  temporary differences in the cpr used to amortize premiums or accrete discounts  temporary differences related to timing of the recognition of hedge ineffectiveness  permanent and temporary differences related to the timing and amount recognized for stock based compensation and permanent differences for excise tax expense 

table of contents for the period from may  through december  period ended december  we commenced operations on may  and therefore do not consider comparisons of fiscal year to the period from may  to december  to be meaningful 
accordingly  the results of operations for the period ended december  is presented on a stand alone basis 
interest income and asset yield interest income was million during the period ended december  the average asset yield on our investment portfolio was on average earning total assets of billion during the period ended december  our interest income during the period ended december  was reduced by million of net amortization of premiums and discounts on our investment portfolio  or basis points 
as of december   the unamortized net premium was million 
the weighted average asset yield on our investment portfolio as of december  was 
leverage our weighted average leverage during the period ended december  was times our average stockholders equity 
our actual leverage will vary from time to time based on various factors  including our management s opinion of the level of risk of our assets and liabilities  our liquidity position  our level of unused borrowing capacity  over collateralization levels required by lenders when we pledge agency securities to secure our borrowings and the current market value of our investment portfolio 
interest expense and cost of funds interest expense was million during the period ended december  our average cost of funds was on average repurchase agreements outstanding of billion for the period ended december  compared to the average one month libor of during the same period 
as of december   our average cost of funds was 
as of december   we had entered into interest rate swap agreements for a total notional amount of billion  or of the outstanding balance under our repurchase agreements 
our interest rate swaps increased the cost of our borrowings by million  or basis points  for the period ended december  all of our interest rate swap agreements were entered into during the second quarter of with effective dates in november and december net interest income and net interest rate spread net interest income  which equals interest income less interest expense  was million for the period ended december  the average net interest rate spread  which equals the average yield on our assets for the period less the average cost of funds for the period  was during the period ended december  as of december   the net interest rate spread was 
gain on sale of agency securities  net during the period ended december   we sold agency securities with a cost basis of million for cash proceeds of million realizing a gross gain of million and a gross loss of million  for a net gain of million 
there was no receivable for sold agency securities as of december  gain on derivative instruments  net during the period ended december   we realized a net gain of million on our derivative instruments 
the net gain on derivative instruments was driven by tba securities and put and call options on tba securities 
for additional information  see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 

table of contents during the period ended december   we recorded a gain of million in gain on derivative instruments in our consolidated statement of operations related to our settled put and call options and tba securities 
as of december   we had no outstanding put or call options or tba securities 
at no point during the period ended december  was the notional amount of options and tba securities outstanding larger than the size of our investment portfolio 
under a written put or call option  the counterparty has the right to sell or purchase from us a specified tba security at a predetermined price on the option exercise date in exchange for a premium at execution 
the premium received from writing a put or call option is reported as a liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
when a written put or call option expires unexercised  a realized gain is recorded equal to the premium received 
when we terminate a written put or call option  a realized gain or loss is recorded equal to the difference between the termination payment and the premium received 
when a written put or call option is exercised  a realized gain or loss is recorded equal to the difference between the premium received and the fair value of the exercised put or call option 
in addition  a derivative asset or liability is recorded in our consolidated balance sheet for the tba security resulting from the put or call option exercise 
during the period ended december   we recorded a loss of million as a result of hedge ineffectiveness on our outstanding interest rate swaps and a loss of million as a result of the reclassification from oci of hedged forecasted transactions becoming probable not to occur 
management fee and general and administrative expenses we pay our manager a base management fee payable monthly in arrears in amount equal to one twelfth of of our equity 
our equity is defined as our month end stockholders equity  adjusted to exclude the effect of any unrealized gains or losses included in either retained earnings or oci  each as computed in accordance with gaap 
there is no incentive compensation payable to our manager pursuant to the management agreement 
we accrued a management fee of million during the period ended december  general and administrative expenses were million during the period from may through december  our general and administrative expenses primarily consisted of the allocation of overhead expenses from american capital  information technology costs  accounting fees  legal fees  board of director fees and insurance expenses 
the general and administrative expenses included non recurring expenses of million related to our initial organization and formation costs 
our general and administrative expenses were and of our average assets and average equity  respectively 
net income and net return on equity net income was million or per basic and diluted share during the period ended from may  through december  the annualized net return on average equity was during the period ended december  dividends for the period ended december   we declared dividends of per share 
as a reit  we are required to distribute annually of our taxable income to maintain our status a reit and all of our taxable income to avoid income taxes 
we can treat dividends declared by september  and paid by december  as having been a distribution of our taxable income for fiscal year as of december   we had undistributed taxable income of million that will be distributed in income as determined under gaap differs from income as determined under tax because of both temporary and permanent differences in income and expense recognition 
examples include differences in the cpr used to amortize premiums or accrete discounts as well as treatment of start up organizational costs  hedge ineffectiveness and stock based compensation 

table of contents income taxes as a reit  we are subject to a nondeductible federal excise tax of if we do not distribute at least of our ordinary taxable income and of our capital gains taxable income for each calendar year ending december  including any undistributed income from the prior excise tax year 
for the period ended december   we did not accrue any federal excise taxes because our calendar year distributions met the minimum distribution requirements 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of funds are borrowings under master repurchase agreements  equity offerings  asset sales and monthly principal and interest payments on our investment portfolio 
because the level of our borrowings can be adjusted on a daily basis  the level of cash and cash equivalents carried on the balance sheet is significantly less important than the potential liquidity available under our borrowing arrangements 
we currently believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources available for the acquisition of additional investments  repayments on borrowings  maintenance of any margin requirements and the payment of cash dividends as required for our continued qualification as a reit 
to qualify as a reit  we must distribute annually at least of our taxable income 
to the extent that we annually distribute all of our taxable income in a timely manner  we will generally not be subject to federal and state income taxes 
we currently expect to distribute all of our taxable income 
this distribution requirement limits our ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital from operations 
equity capital raising activities to the extent we raise additional equity capital through follow on equity offerings  through our controlled equity offering sm program or under our dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan  we currently anticipate using cash proceeds from such transactions to purchase additional agency securities  to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our repurchase agreements and for other general corporate purposes 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to raise additional equity capital at any particular time or on any particular terms 
equity offerings on may   we completed our ipo by selling million shares of our common stock at per share for proceeds  net of the underwriters discount  of million 
concurrent with the ipo  american capital purchased million shares of our common stock in a private placement at per share for aggregate proceeds of million 
in august  we completed a public offering in which million shares of our common stock were sold at a public offering price of per share 
upon completion of the offering we received proceeds  net of the underwriters discount and other offering costs  of million 
in october  we completed a public offering in which million shares of our common stock were sold at a public offering price of per share 
upon completion of the offering we received proceeds  net of the underwriters discount and other offering costs  of million 
in may  we completed a public offering in which million shares of our common stock were sold at a public offering price of per share 
upon completion of the offering we received proceeds  net of the underwriters discount and other offering costs  of million 
in october  we completed a public offering in which million shares of our common stock were sold at a public offering price of per share 
upon completion of the offering we received proceeds  net of the underwriters discount and other offering costs  of million 

table of contents in december  we completed a public offering in which million shares of our common stock were sold at a public offering price of per share 
upon completion of the offering we received proceeds  net of the underwriters discount and other offering costs  of million 
controlled equity offering sm program during fiscal year  we entered into a sales agreement with an underwriter to  from time to time  publicly offer and sell up to million shares of our common stock in privately negotiated and or at the market transactions 
during fiscal year  we sold million shares of our common stock under the sales agreement at an average offering price of per share for proceeds  net of the underwriter s discount  of million 
as of december   million shares of common stock remain under the sales agreement 
dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan we sponsor a dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan through which stockholders may purchase additional shares of our common stock by reinvesting some or all of the cash dividends received on shares of our common stock 
stockholders may also make optional cash purchases of shares of our common stock subject to certain limitations detailed in the plan prospectus 
during fiscal year  we issued million shares under the plan for cash proceeds of million 
we did not issue any shares under the plan during fiscal year and the period from may  through december  as of december   there were million shares available for issuance under the plan 
debt capital as part of our investment strategy  we borrow against our investment portfolio pursuant to master repurchase agreements 
we expect that our borrowings pursuant to repurchase transactions under such master repurchase agreements generally will have maturities that range from to days  but may have maturities of less than days or up to days 
when adjusted for net payables and receivables for agency securities purchased but not yet settled and other debt  our leverage ratio was times the amount of our stockholders equity as of december  our cost of borrowings under master repurchase agreements generally corresponds to libor plus or minus a margin 
we have master repurchase agreements with financial institutions  subject to certain conditions 
as of december   borrowings under repurchase arrangements secured by agency securities totaled billion and other debt associated with a structured transaction accounted for as a financing transaction totaled billion 
as of december   we did not have an amount at risk with any counterparty greater than of our stockholders equity 
refer to note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for further details regarding our borrowings under repurchase agreements and other debt and weighted average interest rates as of december  and amounts available to be borrowed under our repurchase agreements are dependent upon lender collateral requirements and the lender s determination of the fair value of the securities pledged as collateral  which fluctuates with changes in interest rates  credit quality and liquidity conditions within the investment banking  mortgage finance and real estate industries 
under the repurchase agreements  we may be required to pledge additional assets to the repurchase agreement counterparties ie  lenders in the event the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such lenders demand additional collateral a margin call  which may take the form of additional securities or cash 
similarly  if the estimated fair value of investment securities increases due to changes in the market interest rates  lenders may release collateral back to us 
specifically  margin calls would result from a decline in the value of the agency securities securing our repurchase agreements and prepayments on the mortgages securing such agency securities 
as of december   we have met all margin requirements 
we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million and unpledged agency securities of billion available to meet margin calls on our repurchase agreements and derivative instruments as of december  
table of contents although we believe that we will have adequate sources of liquidity available to us through repurchase agreement financing to execute our business strategy  there can be no assurances that repurchase agreement financing will be available to us upon the maturity of our current repurchase agreements to allow us to renew or replace our repurchase agreement financing on favorable terms or at all 
if our repurchase agreement lenders default on their obligations to resell the underlying agency securities back to us at the end of the term  we could incur a loss equal to the difference between the value of the agency securities and the cash we originally received 
we maintain an interest rate risk management strategy under which we use derivative financial instruments to manage the adverse impact of interest rates changes on the value of our investment portfolio as well as our cash flows 
in particular  we attempt to mitigate the risk of the cost of our short term variable rate liabilities increasing at a faster rate than the earnings of our long term assets during a period of rising interest rates 
the principal derivative instruments that we use are interest rate swaps  supplemented with the use of interest rate swaptions  tba agency securities  options and futures 
we use interest rate swap agreements to effectively lock in fixed rates on a portion of our short term borrowings because longer term committed borrowings are not available at attractive terms 
we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to attempt to mitigate the risk of the cost of our short term variable rate liabilities rising during a period of rising interest rates  thereby compressing the net spreads that we earn on our long term fixed rate assets 
as of december   we had interest rate swap agreements that were designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes of a like amount of our short term borrowings 
refer to note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for further details regarding our outstanding interest rate swaps as of december  and and the related activity for fiscal year off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not maintain any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  or special purpose or variable interest entities  established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  as of december   we had not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities or entered into any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s 
market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risks that we are exposed to are interest rate risk  prepayment risk  spread risk  liquidity risk  extension risk and inflation risk 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing liabilities  by affecting the spread between our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
changes in the level of interest rates can also affect the rate of prepayments of our securities and the value of the agency securities that constitute our investment portfolio  which affects our ability to realize gains from the sale of these assets and impacts our ability and the amount that we can borrow against these securities 
we may utilize a variety of financial instruments in order to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on our operations  including interest rate swap agreements  interest rate swaptions  interest rate cap or floor contracts and futures or forward contracts 
we may also purchase or short tba and us treasury securities  purchase or write put or call options on tba securities or we may invest in other types of mortgage derivative securities 
when we use these types of derivatives to hedge the risk of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  we may be subject to certain risks  including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments to holders of our common stock and that the losses may exceed the amount we invested in the instruments 
our profitability and the value of our investment portfolio including derivatives used for hedging purposes may be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates including resulting changes in forward yield curves 
the following table quantifies the estimated changes in net interest income and investment portfolio value should interest rates go up or down by and basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other and the current yield curve 
these estimates were compiled using a combination of third party services  market data and internal models 
all changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the projected net interest income and investment portfolio value at the base interest rate scenario 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates as of december  given the low level of interest rates  we also apply a floor of for all anticipated interest rates included in our assumptions  such that any hypothetical interest rate decrease would have a limited positive impact on our funding costs beyond a certain level 
however  because estimated prepayment speeds are unaffected by this floor  it is expected that an increase in our prepayment speeds as a result of a hypothetical interest rate decrease would result in an acceleration of our premium amortization and could result in reinvestment of such prepaid principal into lower yielding assets 
actual results could differ materially from estimates  especially in the current market environment 
the accuracy of the projected agency securities prices relies on assumptions that define specific agency securities spreads and varying prepayment assumptions at projected interest rate levels 
to the extent that these estimates or other assumptions do not hold true  which is likely in a period of high price volatility  actual results will likely differ materially from projections and could be larger or smaller than the estimates in the table below 
moreover  if different models were employed in the analysis  materially different projections could result 
in addition  while the tables below reflect the estimated impact of interest rate increases and decreases on a static portfolio we may from time to time sell any of our agency securities as a part of our overall management of our investment portfolio 

table of contents change in interest rate percentage change in projected net interest income percentage change in projected portfolio value  with effect of derivatives basis points basis points basis points basis points prepayment risk premiums and discounts associated with the purchase of agency securities are amortized or accreted into interest income over the projected lives of the securities  including contractual payments and estimated prepayments using the interest method 
furthermore  us government agency or us government entity buyouts of loans in imminent risk of default  loans that have been modified  or loans that have defaulted will generally be reflected as prepayments on agency securities and also increase the uncertainty around these estimates 
our policy for estimating prepayment speeds for calculating the effective yield is to evaluate published prepayment data for similar agency securities  market consensus and current market conditions 
if the actual prepayment experienced differs from our estimate of prepayments  we will be required to make an adjustment to the amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts that would have an impact on future income 
spread risk our available for sale securities are reflected at their estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in oci pursuant to asc as of december   the fair value of these securities was billion 
when the spread between the yield on our agency securities and us treasury securities or swap rates widens  this could cause the value of our agency securities to decline  creating what we refer to as spread risk 
the spread risk associated with our agency securities and the resulting fluctuations in fair value of these securities can occur independent of interest rates and may relate to other factors impacting the mortgage and fixed income markets such as liquidity or changes in required rates of return on different assets 
liquidity risk the primary liquidity risk for us arises from financing long term assets with shorter term borrowings in the form of repurchase agreements 
our assets which are pledged to secure repurchase agreements are high quality agency securities and cash 
as of december   we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million and unpledged agency securities of billion available to meet margin calls on our repurchase agreements  derivative instruments and for other corporate purposes 
however  should the value of our agency securities pledged as collateral suddenly decrease  margin calls relating to our repurchase agreements could increase  causing an adverse change in our liquidity position 
as such  we cannot assure that we will always be able to renew or roll our repurchase agreements 
in addition  our counterparties have the option to increase our haircuts margin requirements on the assets we pledge against repurchase agreements  thereby reducing the amount that can be borrowed against an asset even if they agree to renew or roll the repurchase agreement 
significantly higher haircuts can reduce our ability to leverage our portfolio or even force us to sell assets  especially if correlated with asset price declines or faster prepayment rates on our assets 
extension risk the projected weighted average life and the duration or interest rate sensitivity of our investments is based on our manager s assumptions regarding the rate at which the borrowers will prepay the underlying mortgage loans 
in general  we use interest rate swaps and swaptions to help manage our funding cost on our investments in the event that interest rates rise 
these swaps or swaptions allow us to reduce our funding exposure on the notional amount of the swap for a specified period of time by agreeing to pay a fixed rate in exchange for receiving a floating rate that generally tracks our financing costs under our repurchase agreements 

table of contents however  if prepayment rates decrease in a rising interest rate environment  the average life or duration of our fixed rate assets or the fixed rate portion of the arms or other assets generally extends 
this could have a negative impact on our results from operations  as our interest rate swap maturities are fixed and will  therefore  cover a smaller percentage of our funding exposure on our mortgage assets to the extent that their average lives increase due to slower prepayments 
this situation may also cause the market value of our agency securities collateralized by fixed rate mortgages or hybrid arms to decline by more than otherwise would be the case while most of our hedging instruments with the exception of short tba mortgage positions or interest only strips would not receive any offsetting gains 
in extreme situations  we may be forced to sell assets to maintain adequate liquidity  which could cause us to incur realized losses 
inflation risk virtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature 
as a result  interest rates and other factors influence our performance more so than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
further  our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and our distributions are determined by our board of directors based primarily by our net income as calculated for income tax purposes 
in each case  our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost and or fair market value without considering inflation
