item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following management s discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those set forth under item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
highlights our fiscal net sales of million represented a decrease of from our fiscal net sales 
net sales in our firearm division decreased by to million 
net loss for fiscal was million  or per fully diluted share  compared with net income of million  or per fully diluted share  for fiscal our fiscal net loss resulted in large part from a goodwill and intangible assets impairment charge related to our july acquisition of universal safety response  inc since renamed smith wesson security solutions  inc and referred to herein as swss of million  net of deferred taxes of million  offset by a million favorable adjustment to revalue  shares of our common stock related to the swss acquisition 
net income for fiscal included a million favorable adjustment related to this share revaluation 
excluding these two items  net income for fiscal would have been million  a million  or  decrease from fiscal net income 
our operating results for fiscal were affected by numerous factors  including the following a decline in revenue resulting from lower order intake in our firearm business as ordering returned to more normal levels compared with the strong consumer demand that occurred after the november presidential election  offset by an increase in sales in our security solutions division over the prior fiscal year  primarily as a result of including a full year of revenue in fiscal operating results versus the nine and a half months included in fiscal operating results 
the ongoing economic downturn and reduced federal and corporate spending in the perimeter security industry had a negative impact on sales in our security solutions division during fiscal the relocation of our rochester  new hampshire operating activities  including the production of our hunting products  to our springfield  massachusetts facility resulting in million in relocation costs  of which million was attributed to cost of goods sold and  related to operating expenses  and resulting in lower margins than in the prior fiscal year due to the negative impact on efficiencies in that product line 
a negative impact on gross profit margin resulting from reduced pricing in selected firearm products as part of our price repositioning strategy  which included price protection adjustments to distributors for products held in their inventory at the time the price reductions were announced  increased promotional activities related to our firearm products over the prior fiscal year  a period in which there was a significant increase in consumer demand  and weak demand caused by federal funding deficits and corporate budgetary constraints combined with an increase in price competitiveness in the perimeter security market to lower gross margins in our security solutions division 
a non cash impairment charge of million  net of million of deferred taxes  based on our determination that the goodwill and intangible assets related to our acquisition of swss were impaired due to market conditions and other factors 
legal and consulting costs of million related to the doj unsealed indictments of individuals from the law enforcement and military equipment industries  one of whom was our vice president sales  international  even though we were not charged in the indictment 
we incurred million of similar costs in fiscal our business we are one of the world s leading manufacturers of firearms

key industry data handguns have been subject to legislative actions in the past  and the market has reacted to these actions 
there was a substantial increase in sales in the early s during the period leading up to and shortly after the enactment of the brady bill 
in the period from through  the us handgun market increased by over  as consumers purchased handguns because of the fear of prohibition of handgun ownership 
the market levels then returned to pre levels and grew at normal industry growth rates until late in calendar  when the market increased in what appears to be fears surrounding crime and terrorism  an economic downturn  and a change in the white house administration 
like the increase in  this increase in the market was temporary in nature and the market returned to more normal levels in fiscal within the us handgun market  we estimate that approximately of the market is pistols and is revolvers 
we also estimate that we have an share of the us consumer market for handguns 
this compares with approximately in the period just before we acquired smith wesson corp 
in and approximately during the s

revolver sales increased over the prior fiscal year because of the significant demand for our bodyguard revolver  offset by reduced volume in our aluminum frame products to the consumer market and significantly reduced international shipments  which resulted from substantial changes we made in our foreign sales personnel and foreign representatives  modifications we made in our foreign sales processes  and our determination not to sell our products in certain foreign countries 
price repositioning and the costs of a rebate program on small frame revolvers negatively impacted sales dollars while helping to spur unit sales 
pistol sales were higher than in the prior fiscal year driven by the introduction of our bodyguard concealed carry pistol 
sales of metal pistols were lower compared with the prior fiscal year primarily due to reduced international shipments  while sales of sigma were down as demand shifted to concealed carry in the domestic marketplace 
walther product sales declined from the prior fiscal year because of increased competition in small frame and concealed carry products 
sales of modern sporting rifles  the product line most impacted by the reduction in consumer demand  declined by from the prior fiscal year 
however  sales within this product line were favorably impacted in the fourth quarter of fiscal by the introduction of our new sport model 
premium product sales increased over the prior fiscal year  primarily because of the continued success of our pro series handguns and the introduction of our matched set of engraved bodyguard revolver and pistol 
hunting product sales increased over the prior fiscal year because of increased bolt action  rimfire  and black powder product sales 
parts and accessories sales were flat year over year with increased sales of handgun accessories being more than offset by a reduction in sales of hunting accessories 
sales of security solutions products and services increased over the prior fiscal year  primarily as a result of including a full year of revenue in fiscal operating results versus the nine and a half months included in fiscal operating results 
the ongoing economic downturn and reduced federal and corporate spending in the perimeter security industry had a negative impact on sales during fiscal 
table of contents the order backlog as of april  was  of which  related to firearms and  related to security solutions 
the firearm order backlog was  higher than at the end of fiscal and  higher than at the end of the third quarter of fiscal  primarily as a result of backlog generated by new products and the success of the price repositioning in the sigma and m p series of pistols 
firearm orders received that have not yet shipped could be cancelled  particularly if demand were to suddenly decrease 
therefore  our firearm backlog may not be indicative of future sales  particularly since the order demand currently exceeds our manufacturing capacity 
our security solutions backlog consists primarily of project oriented contracts and or letters of intent that provide for progress payments and are not typically cancelled 
therefore  security solutions backlog is more indicative of future sales  but is subject to significant timing variations depending on the size  nature  and scope of each order within the total backlog at any given period of time 
sales in the consumer channel were  a  or  increase over sales of  in fiscal sales to state and local government agencies were  a  or  decrease from fiscal sales of  resulting from a decline in firearm sales  offset by an increase in security solutions sales to such agencies

federal government sales of  were  or  lower than fiscal sales as a result of federal budgetary constraints in homeland security line items 
sales to corporate customers in our security solutions division totaled  a  or  increase over fiscal sales  primarily because of including a full year of sales for fiscal compared with only nine and a half months for the prior fiscal year 
fiscal net product and services sales compared with fiscal net product and services sales for fiscal increased because of strong consumer driven growth in modern sporting rifles and the impact of our acquisition of swss in july revolver sales were slightly lower than in the prior fiscal year 
unit sales were down due to reduced availability of product to meet the extremely high level of demand in the early part of the fiscal year coupled with delayed international shipments as a result of substantial changes we made in our foreign sales personnel and foreign representatives  modifications we made in our foreign sales processes  and our determination not to sell our products in certain foreign countries  partially offset by reduced promotional costs 
pistol sales were lower than in the prior fiscal year with metal and sigma pistols being significantly below the prior fiscal year and m p series of pistols flat year over year 
walther product sales increased over the prior fiscal year because of the pk pistol product introduction and increased production and availability of the german manufactured products 
the introduction of our new m p modern sporting rifle and increased capacity to produce all modern sporting rifles to meet higher consumer demand led to increased sales of these products 
new product offerings within our classics series of handguns increased sales of premium products by over the prior fiscal year 
hunting products were negatively impacted by the late fiscal discontinuation of smith wesson branded bolt action rifles  which was more than offset by the increased performance of thompson center arms branded bolt action rifles spurred by the introduction of our venture tm product line and improved black powder rifle sales during the second half of fiscal parts and accessories sales grew over the prior fiscal year because of an increased sales focus on hunting products and higher demand for parts and accessories for our handguns  reflecting the high demand for both new and used firearms 
the order backlog as of april  was  of which  related to firearms and  related to security solutions 
the firearm order backlog was  lower than at the end of fiscal  but represented a  increase over the backlog at the end of the third quarter of fiscal  primarily as a result of backlog generated by new products 
in spite of the year over year decline in firearm backlog  our fiscal year end backlog remained substantially higher than what we typically experienced prior to the extraordinary increases in consumer demand for firearms in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal security solutions backlog declined  from the end of the third quarter of fiscal as customer investment decisions began to slow

in addition  gross profit as a percentage of net products and services sold in our firearm division decreased as a result of a targeted price repositioning strategy for several product lines aimed at increasing market share 
this repositioning resulted in a one time credit of  to certain distributors and large retailers to protect their inventory in the distribution channel from the price reduction  which also negatively impacted gross margin 
in addition  gross profit was negatively impacted by increased promotional activity prior to the price repositioning of  increased distributor incentives in the second half of the fiscal year of  costs associated with our relocation of hunting production from our rochester  new hampshire facility to our springfield  massachusetts facility of  and related production and labor inefficiencies associated with the relocation 
gross profit in our security solutions division for fiscal decreased from the prior fiscal year in spite of an increase in products and services sold because certain projects were completed significantly below expected margins  competitive pressures  and delayed or reduced demand for projects due to federal and corporate budgetary pressures 
we acquired the security solutions business on july  fiscal cost of products and services sold and gross profit compared with fiscal gross profit in our firearm division for fiscal grew as a result of the increase in sales while gross profit as a percentage of net products and services sold improved as a result of a  reduction in warranty expense  a  reduction in promotional spending  and favorable absorption resulting from high production volume to

in our firearm division  the increase in research and development expenses over the prior fiscal year was primarily due to increased test samples to support new product development 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses was a result of increased consulting and outside services of  which included improvements in our customer acceptance process  market research and consulting  and licensing consulting  as well as advertising of  in support of new product launches and cooperative advertising cost sharing agreements with several of our large retail customers 
the increase in general and administrative costs over the prior fiscal year included  of legal and consulting fees related our investigation of the doj and sec matters   of bad debt costs   of legal fees related to the filing of an international trade commission itc action against several of our black powder competitors   of severance costs  and  in consulting fees related to internal audit activities 
these amounts were offset by  of lower profit sharing   of lower stock compensation expense  and  of lower management incentive compensation 

table of contents operating expenses as a percentage of net products and services sold for our firearm division increased by  predominately due to a  increase in costs related to the doj and sec matters  severance costs related to the manufacturing plant relocation  and costs associated with the itc filing

in fiscal  we incurred  of additional bad debt costs primarily on one contract where the general contractor was removed by the government 
in addition  in fiscal  increased overhead costs were incurred  including  of warranty costs   of increased intangible amortization   of increased depreciation   of severance costs  and  of legal fees 
excluding the impact of the impairment charge recorded in fiscal for goodwill and intangible assets related to our acquisition of swss  operating expenses as a percentage of net products and services sold for our security solutions division increased by  predominately due to the increase in employee costs described above 
fiscal operating expenses compared with fiscal excluding the impact of the impairment charge recorded in fiscal for goodwill and other long lived intangible assets related to our thompson center arms acquisition  operating expenses for fiscal increased  over fiscal operating expenses because of increased profit sharing and management incentive compensation related to improved financial performance versus the prior fiscal year  increased administrative costs related to our acquisition of swss  including legal and accounting related consulting fees  and increased legal and consulting fees related to allegations against one of our employees under the fcpa 
this was partially offset by lower amortization of intangible assets due to our impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets of thompson center arms and lower bad debt reserve charges that arose from the sudden decline in the economy during calendar the increase in research and development costs in fiscal related to  in increased samples and testing materials in support of new product introductions   in increased salaries and benefits  and  of reduced allocations to manufacturing based on an increased focus on new product engineering 
the increase in selling and marketing expense reflected  in increased salaries and benefits and  in increased commissions in the hunting business as we transitioned back to the use of a manufacturers representative sales model 
in addition  travel costs increased  and marketing consulting fees increased by  while advertising and marketing samples declined  the increase in general and administrative expenses resulted from a  increase in profit sharing and management incentive compensation   of increased recruiting and relocation costs   in increased professional fees related to both defense costs and our internal investigation of the fcpa matter  and  in increased professional fees related to the acquisition of swss 
offsetting these costs was  of reduced bad debt costs and  in reduced amortization of intangible assets subsequent to the impairment of the thompson center arms assets in fiscal operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was for fiscal and for fiscal  excluding the impairment charge recorded in fiscal for goodwill and other intangible assets related to our thompson center arms acquisition 
this increase was predominately because of the  incurred in the fcpa investigation and employee defense costs

table of contents interest expense the following table sets forth certain information regarding interest expense for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands change change interest expense interest expense increased for fiscal compared with fiscal due to the early retirement of million of our senior convertible notes  which resulted in a  write off of debt refinancing costs 
this debt was exchanged for million of our senior notes  resulting in higher interest expense  primarily in the fourth quarter of fiscal the exchange of the senior convertible notes for the higher coupon senior notes was made because of the impending december date on which holders of the senior convertible notes could require us to repurchase their senior convertible notes as well as to remove the dilutive effects of the senior convertible notes 
interest expense decreased for fiscal as a result of the repayment of  of long term debt in december and overall increased cash balances throughout the fiscal year 
income tax expense the following table sets forth certain information regarding income tax expense for the fiscal years ended april    dollars in thousands change change income tax expense our income tax expense for fiscal included the effect of changes in temporary differences between book value and tax bases of assets and liabilities and net operating loss carryforwards 
these amounts are reflected in the balance of our net deferred tax assets  which totaled  after valuation allowance  as of april  we had federal net operating loss carryforwards amounting to  as of april  we obtained  in additional loss carryforwards through our acquisition of swss on july   the majority of which was utilized in fiscal the net operating loss carryforwards at april  expire through fiscal year internal revenue code section limits our utilization of these losses to approximately  in fiscal and  per subsequent year 
it is possible that future substantial changes in our ownership could occur that could result in a reduction in some or all of our loss carryforwards pursuant to internal revenue code section if such an ownership change were to occur  there would be an annual limitation on the remaining tax loss carryforwards that could be utilized 
adjustments to reserves and book versus tax difference on amortization of intangible assets increased the overall net deferred tax asset to  as of april  there was  of state net operating loss carryforwards as of april  there was  of state net operating loss carryforwards as of april  there was  and  of state tax credit carryforwards as of april  and  respectively

the increase in the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets for state net operating losses and credits related mainly to our operations in franklin  tennessee 
no other valuation allowance was provided on our deferred federal income tax assets as of april  or  as we believe that it is more likely than not that all such assets will be realized 
in order to utilize the unreserved portion of our net operating loss carryforwards  the minimum level of annual taxable income that we would have achieve must equal or exceed the amount of federal net operating carryforwards for fiscal years through we believe that achievement of that level of taxable income is more likely than

capital expenditures for new products  capacity expansion  and process improvements represent important cash needs 

table of contents the following table sets forth certain cash flow information for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands change change operating activities investing activities financing activities total operating activities represent the principal source of our cash flow 
cash flow from operating activities increased significantly in fiscal over fiscal levels in spite of the reduction in profitability due to a  reduction in accounts receivable  a  increase in accounts payable  and a  increase in accrued taxes other than income 
accounts receivable declined compared with the prior fiscal year  primarily as a result of timing of fourth quarter sales 
accounts payable were high at the end of fiscal  primarily due to significant capital spending incurred late in the fourth quarter to meet the requirements of the massachusetts economic development incentive program that granted us up to  in refundable tax credits for capital spending on qualified property that exceeded million 
accrued taxes other than income increased as a result of a change in federal excise tax deposit requirements from bi weekly to quarterly  allowing our first calendar quarterly payment to be made on may   after the end of our fiscal year 
in addition  in fiscal  income tax payments were significantly higher as a result of our higher taxable income 
cash flows from operating activities decreased significantly in fiscal from fiscal levels  largely as a result of the impact that the fiscal spike in consumer demand had on reducing year end accounts receivable and inventory as of april  accounts receivable increased by  due to relatively high april firearm sales and the acquisition of swss 
inventory increased  during fiscal primarily due to the slowdown in consumer demand  which allowed for the replenishment of some firearm safety stock 
cash paid for income taxes represented a significant increase during fiscal because of the significant increase in profitability of the consolidated company 
cash used for investing activities was lower in fiscal than in fiscal  primarily because fiscal included  invested for the july acquisition of swss  partially offset by increased capital spending on property and equipment of  cash used for investing activities was higher in fiscal than in fiscal due to  invested in the july acquisition of swss and increased capital spending of  cash used for financing activities in fiscal reflected the net exchange of  of the senior convertible notes for senior notes and no other borrowing activity compared with fiscal  which included  of long term debt repayments offset by  of proceeds from the issuance of  shares of common stock 
cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was favorable compared with fiscal due to lower long term debt repayments totaling approximately  and a fiscal repayment of  in revolving line borrowings 
in addition  proceeds from share issuances in fiscal were  higher than proceeds received in fiscal at april   we had open letters of credit aggregating  at april   we had  in cash and cash equivalents on hand 
we have a  revolving line of credit with td bank  na  with no balance outstanding as of april  our credit agreement with td bank contains financial covenants relating to maintaining maximum leverage and minimum debt service coverage 
the indenture relating to the senior convertible notes contains a financial covenant relating to maximum additional indebtedness 
the indenture relating to the senior notes contains a financial covenant relating to times interest earned 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of april  based upon our current working capital position  current operating plans  and expected business conditions  we believe that our existing 
table of contents capital resources and credit facilities will be adequate to fund our operations  including our outstanding debt and other commitments  for the next months  apart from major acquisitions 
we anticipate that the holders of the entire  principal amount of the outstanding senior convertible notes will require us to repurchase those senior convertible notes for cash on december  we intend to utilize cash on hand or borrowings under our credit agreement to make these payments 
other matters inflation we do not believe that inflation had a material impact on us during fiscal   or critical accounting policies use of estimates in preparation of financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods 
operating results in the future could vary from the amounts derived from these estimates and assumptions 
in addition  future facts and circumstances could alter our estimates with respect to the adequacy of insurance reserves 
our significant estimates include gross margin and percentage of completion on in process security solutions projects  accruals for warranty  product liability  workers compensation  environmental liability  excess and obsolete inventory  forfeiture rates on stock based awards  asset impairments  and medical claims payable 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition for our firearm segment  we recognize revenue when the following four basic criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
for our security solutions segment  we recognize revenue from fixed price installation contracts using the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to our total costs for each contract 
product sales account for a substantial portion of our firearm revenue 
we recognize revenue from firearm product sales when the earnings process is complete and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  which is generally upon shipment 
we also provide tooling  forging  heat treating  finishing  plating  and engineering support services to customers  we recognize this revenue when accepted by the customer  when no further contingencies or material performance obligations exist  and when collectability is reasonably assured  thereby earning us the right to receive and retain payments for services performed and billed 
we determine percentage of completion by comparing the cost incurred to date to the estimated total cost required to complete the project 
we consider costs incurred to date to be the most reliable  available measure of progress on these projects 
we make adjustments to estimates to complete in the periods in which facts resulting in a change become known 
when the estimate indicates that a loss will be incurred  we record the loss in the period in which it is identified 
when reliable estimates cannot be made  we recognize revenue upon completion 
significant judgment is involved in the estimation process for each contract 
different assumptions could yield materially different results 
delays in the installation process could negatively affect operations in a given period by increasing volatility in revenue recognition 
recognition of revenue in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments that affect the timing and amount of reported revenue 
we recognize trademark licensing revenue for individual licensees on a quarterly basis based on historical experience and expected cash receipts from licensees 
this revenue consists of minimum royalties and or a percentage of a licensee s sales on licensed products 
under our current licensing agreements  this revenue is payable on a calendar quarter basis 
we recognize non refundable license fees received upon initial signing of license agreements as revenue when no future obligation is required on our part 
as a result of a combination of 
table of contents uncertain factors regarding existing licensees  including current and past payment performance  market acceptance of the licensee s product  and insufficient historical experience  we believe that reasonable assurance of collectability does not exist based on the results and past payment performance of licensees in general 
therefore  we do not recognize minimum royalty payments upon contract signing but instead record royalty revenue monthly when the minimum royalty can be reasonably estimated for that month and payment is assured 
as of april   minimum royalties to be collected in the future amounted to  valuation of long lived tangible and intangible assets and goodwill we have significant long lived tangible and intangible assets  which are susceptible to valuation adjustments as a result of changes in various factors or conditions 
the most significant long lived tangible and intangible assets are fixed assets  developed technology  patents  trademarks  and tradenames 
we amortize all finite lived intangible assets either on a straight line basis or based upon patterns in which we expect to utilize the economic benefits of such assets 
with the exception of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  we initially determine the values of intangible assets by a risk adjusted  discounted cash flow approach 
we assess the potential impairment of identifiable intangible assets and fixed assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable and at least annually 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment of such assets  include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of or use of the assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and a decline in our market capitalization below net book value 
future adverse changes in these or other unforeseeable factors could result in an impairment charge that would materially impact future results of operations and financial position in the reporting period identified 
in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other  we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis as of the end of our fiscal third quarter and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  to assess whether impairment is present 
we have reviewed the provisions of asc with respect to the criteria necessary to evaluate the number of reporting units that exist 
based on our review of the segment reporting topic  asc  we have determined that we operate in three reporting units one for our springfield  massachusetts and houlton  maine facilities  a second for our rochester  new hampshire facility  and a third for swss 
we have determined that we operate in two segments one for our firearm companies and a second for our security solutions subsidiary  swss 
as of april   we have no goodwill recorded on our books 
based on a combination of factors occurring during fiscal  including federal and corporate budgetary constraints  increased price competition  low barrier to entry  and other factors  we determined that indicators for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets existed in our swss reporting unit and  as a result  we conducted an evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets associated with the acquisition of that reporting unit 
based on the earnings and cash flow forecast for the next ten years  the fair value of this reporting unit was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows 
based on the work performed  we recorded a goodwill impairment loss of  in fiscal based on a combination of factors occurring during fiscal  including the economic environment and market conditions in the hunting industry  we determined that indicators for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets existed in our rochester  new hampshire reporting unit and  as a result  we conducted an evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets associated with the acquisition of that reporting unit 
based on lower order intake during fiscal and lower than expected operating profits and cash flows in this reporting unit  the earnings forecast for the next ten years was revised 
the fair value of this reporting unit was estimated using the expected 
table of contents present value of future cash flows 
based on the work performed  we recorded a goodwill impairment loss of  in fiscal we periodically review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of those assets are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded carrying value for the asset 
if impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
as noted above  economic and market conditions affecting the swss and rochester  new hampshire reporting units required us to test for impairment of long lived assets pertaining to those reporting units in fiscal and  respectively 
based on those assessments  we recorded impairment charges of  and  respectively  to reflect the excess of the carrying value of long lived intangible assets over the discounted cash flows 
no impairment charges were taken in fiscal based on the review of long lived assets 
we utilize an income approach  with discounted cash flows  to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit 
we selected this method because we believe that it most appropriately measures our income producing assets 
we considered using the market approach and the cost approach  but concluded that they were not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant and available market comparisons 
the income approach is based on the projected cash flows that are discounted to their present value using discount rates that consider the timing and risk of the forecasted cash flows 
we believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units expected long term operating cash performance 
this approach also mitigates the impact of the cyclical trends that occur in our industries 
fair value is estimated using internally developed forecasts and assumptions 
the discount rate used is the average estimated value of a market participant s cost of capital and debt  derived using customary market metrics 
other significant assumptions include terminal value margin rates  future capital expenditures  and changes in future working capital requirements 
we also compare and reconcile our overall fair value to our market capitalization 
while there are inherent uncertainties related to the assumptions used and to our application of these assumptions to this analysis  we believe that the income approach provides a reasonable estimate of the fair value of our reporting units 
the foregoing assumptions were consistent with our long term performance  with limited exceptions 
we believe that our future investments for capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue will decline in future years due to our improved utilization resulting from lean initiatives  and we believe that days sales outstanding will decline as we grow 
we also have assumed that through this economic downturn  our markets have not contracted for the long term  however  it may be a number of years before they fully recover 
these assumptions could deviate materially from actual results 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the useful lives of our long lived assets  determining what reporting units exist  and assessing when events or circumstances would require an interim impairment analysis of goodwill or other long lived assets to be performed 
changes in our organization or our management reporting structure  as well as other events and circumstances  including technological advances  increased competition  and changing economic or market conditions  could result in a shorter estimated useful lives  b additional reporting units  which may require alternative methods of estimating fair values or greater disaggregation or aggregation in our analysis by reporting unit  and c other changes in previous assumptions or estimates 
a change in the weighted average cost of capital  for example  could materially change the valuation and  if increased  could cause an impairment 
in turn  this could have an additional impact on our consolidated financial statements through accelerated amortization and impairment charges 
goodwill and acquired intangibles we completed a significant business acquisition in fiscal  which resulted in significant goodwill and other intangible asset balances 
our business strategy contemplates that we may make additional acquisitions in the future 
our accounting for acquisitions involves significant judgments and estimates  including the fair value of certain forms of consideration  the fair value of acquired intangible assets  which involve projections of future revenue and cash flows  the fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities  including potential contingencies  and the useful lives and  as applicable  the reporting unit  of the assets 
our financial position and results of operations may be materially impacted by changes in our initial assumptions and estimates relating to prior or future acquisitions 
additionally  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit  for purposes of the first 
table of contents step in our annual goodwill impairment test  based on our market value 
if prior or future acquisitions are not accretive to our results of operations as expected or our market value declines dramatically  we may be required to complete the second step  which requires significant judgments and estimates and which may result in material impairment charges in the period in which they are determined 
product liability we provide reserves for potential product liability defense costs based on estimates determined in consultation with litigation counsel 
adjustments to the provision for product liability are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are charged or credited to cost of products and services sold 
this evaluation is based upon information regarding potential or existing product liability cases 
any future costs related to this evaluation are recorded when considered both probable and reasonably estimable 
as of april   the estimated range of reasonably possible additional losses is zero 
environmental liability we provide reserves for potential environmental obligations that we consider probable and for which reasonable estimates of such obligations can be made 
as of april   we had a reserve of  for environmental matters  which is recorded on an undiscounted basis 
inventory we value firearm inventories  consisting primarily of finished firearm components  finished firearms  and related products and accessories  and security solutions inventory  consisting primarily of mechanical and electrical components required for installation of products  at the lower of cost  using the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
an allowance for potential non saleable inventory due to excess stock or obsolescence is based upon a detailed review of inventory components  past history  and expected future usage 
warranty we generally provide a lifetime warranty to the original purchaser of our new firearm products and a provide warranties for up to two years on the materials and workmanship in our security solutions projects  which includes products purchased by us from third party manufacturers 
we provide for estimated warranty obligations in the period in which we recognize the related revenue 
we quantify and record an estimate for warranty related costs based on our actual historical claims experience and the current repair costs 
we make adjustments to accruals as warranty claim data and historical experience warrant 
should we experience actual claims and repair costs that are higher than the estimated claims and repair costs used to calculate the provision  our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns or additional costs materialize would be adversely impacted 
allowance for doubtful accounts we extend credit to our domestic customers and some foreign firearm distributors based on their financial condition 
we offer discounts for early payment on firearm invoices 
when we believe the extension of credit is not advisable  we rely on either a prepayment or a letter of credit 
we place past due balances for collection with an outside agency after days if there has been no good faith effort on the part of the customer to bring their account current 
we write off balances deemed uncollectible by us against our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts through current past due balances  knowledge of our customers financial situations  and past payment history 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based upon income reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes 
we measure these deferred taxes by applying tax rates expected to be in place when the deferred items become subject to income tax or deductible for income tax purposes 

table of contents workers compensation our firearm business is self insured through retentions or deductibles for our workers compensation 
our liability for estimated premiums and incurred losses are actuarially determined and recorded on an undiscounted basis 
our security solutions business maintains a separate workers compensation insurance policy 
stock based compensation we account for stock based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of asc by calculating compensation cost on the date of the grant using the black scholes method 
we then amortize compensation expense over the vesting period 
we estimate the fair value of each stock option or purchase under our employee stock purchase program on the date of the grant using the black scholes option pricing model discounted by an estimated forfeiture rate using the risk free interest rate  expected term  expected volatility  dividend yield variables  and stock price on the date of the grant 
recent accounting pronouncements the nature and impact of recent accounting pronouncements is discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements commencing on page f of this report  which is incorporated herein by reference 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table sets forth a summary of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of april  dollars in thousands less than more than total year years years years short term debt obligations long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term obligations reflected on the balance sheet under gaap total obligations on december   we issued and sold an aggregate of million of senior convertible notes to qualified institutional buyers  pursuant to the terms and conditions of an indenture and securities purchase agreement  each dated as of december  these notes are convertible into shares of our common stock  initially at a conversion price of approximately per share subject to adjustment in certain events  or shares per  principal amount of notes 
the notes may be converted at any time 
the notes pay interest on june and december of each year at an annual rate of of the unpaid principal amount 
until december   we may at our election redeem all or a portion of the notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest only if the closing price of our common stock for no fewer than trading days in any period of consecutive trading days exceeds of the then applicable conversion price of the notes 
after december   we may redeem at our election all or a portion of the notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 
holders of the notes may require us to repurchase all or part of their notes on december   december   or december   and in the event of a fundamental change in our company  at a price of of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest 
if not redeemed by us or repaid pursuant to the holders right to require repurchase  the notes mature on december  during fiscal  we exchanged million of the senior convertible notes for million of our senior notes 
included in the above million of short term debt obligation is million of contractually obligated interest payments pertaining to the million in outstanding senior convertible notes 
this amount represents interest payments through december   or the first redemption milestone 
we may be required to pay additional interest 
table of contents subsequent to december  redemption date  however  due to the uncertainty of subsequent interest payments  they are not reflected in the above table 
included in the above long term debt obligation is million of contractually obligated interest payments pertaining to the million in the senior notes  which represents interest payments through january  off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any transactions  arrangements  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to affect our liquidity or capital resources 
we have no special purpose or limited purpose entities that provide off balance sheet financing  liquidity  or market or credit risk support or that engage in leasing  hedging  research and development services  or other relationships that expose us to liability that is not reflected on the face of the financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we do not enter into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
our principal market risk relates to changes in the value of the euro relative to the us dollar 
a portion of our gross revenue during the three months and fiscal year ended april  million and million  respectively  representing approximately and  respectively  of aggregate gross firearm revenue came from the sale of goods that were purchased  wholly or partially  from a european manufacturer  in euros 
annually  we purchase approximately million of inventory from a european supplier 
this exposes us to risk from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
a drop in the value of the us dollar in relation to the euro would  to the extent not covered through price adjustments  reduce our gross profit on that million of inventory by approximately million 
in an effort to offset our risks from unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations  we periodically enter into euro forward contracts under which we commit to purchase a minimum amount of euros to be used to pay the european manufacturer 
as of april   we had no forward contracts outstanding 
forward contracts provide protection for us against the depreciation of the us dollar to the euro 
during the fiscal year ended april   we experienced a net gain of  on foreign exchange transactions that we executed during the period in an effort to limit our exposure to fluctuations in the euro dollar exchange rate
