all references to years  unless otherwise noted  refer to our fiscal year  which ends on december we use the phrase constant currency adjusted to indicate that we are comparing certain financial results after removing the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  thereby allowing for the comparison of business performance between periods 
financial results that are constant currency adjusted are calculated by restating current period activity into us dollars using the comparable prior period s foreign currency exchange rates 
this approach is used for all results where the functional currency is not the us dollar 
business and industry overview ciber is a global it consulting  services and outsourcing company primarily serving global blue chip companies and government agencies 
we compete in a large and growing marketplace offering services that include application development and management  erp implementation  change management  project management  systems integration  infrastructure management and end user computing  as well as strategic business and technology consulting 
to a lesser extent  we also resell certain it hardware and software products 
our reportable segments are our operating divisions  which are organized internally primarily by the nature of their services  client base and geography 
in  we operated in five reportable segments  which were our primary operating divisions and consisted of our international division  which includes europe  eastern asia  australia and new zealand  and our custom solutions  us erp  federal and it outsourcing divisions 
in  we are combining operations and management of the custom solutions and us erp divisions and will report them as a single unit called ciber north america going forward 
our international division provides a broad range of it consulting services  including package software implementation  application development  systems integration and support services  with sap related solutions and services accounting for to of its total revenue in our custom solutions division provides application development  integration and support services 
our india based operations are considered part of our custom solutions division 
our us erp division primarily provides enterprise software implementation services  including erp software from software vendors such as oracle  sap and lawson 
our federal division provides a range of custom support services  including infrastructure support  systems integration  mission support and enterprise security 
our it outsourcing division offers outsourced enterprise infrastructure management solutions  including managed hosted infrastructure  service desk and desktop outsourcing  and remote application support services 
we recognize the majority of our services revenue under time and material contracts as hours and costs are incurred 
under fixed price contracts  which currently make up approximately of our services revenue  our revenue is fixed under the contract  while our costs to complete our obligations under the contract are variable 
as a result  our profitability on fixed price contracts can vary significantly and occasionally can even be a loss 
changes in our services revenue are primarily a function of hours worked on revenue generating activities and  to a lesser extent  changes in our average rate per hour and changes in contract mix 
hours worked on revenue producing activities vary with the number of consultants employed and their utilization level 
utilization represents the percentage of time worked on revenue producing engagements divided by the standard hours available ie  hours per week 
our average utilization rates are higher in our custom solutions and federal divisions typically around to as compared to our international and us erp divisions typically around to 
with time and materials contracts  higher consultant utilization results in increased revenue  however  with fixed price contracts  it may result in higher costs and lower gross profit margins because our revenue is fixed 
we actively manage both our number of consultants and our overall utilization levels 
if we determine we have excess available resources that we cannot place on billable assignments in the near future  we consider reducing those resources 
as a result  during the last three years  most of our consultant turnover has been from involuntary termination of employment 
the hourly rate we charge for our services varies based on the level of the consultant involved  the particular expertise of the consultant and the geographic area 
our typical time and materials hourly rates range from to per hour and  on average  are generally highest in our us erp division and lowest in our federal division 
as india based resources become more significant  our average hourly rates will decrease 
for projects which are fixed price  cost plus or level of effort  where our revenue is not directly based on hours incurred  our realized rate per hour will vary significantly depending on success or overages on such projects  as well as the blend of estimated resources used to deliver projects 

table of contents selling  general and administrative sg a costs as a percentage of revenue vary by business segment 
close to of our overall sg a expenses are typically for personnel costs for our operations management  sales and recruiting personnel and administrative staff  as well as our corporate office support staff and executive management personnel 
although these costs are not immediately affected by changes in revenue  there is often a relatively short term correlation between these sg a salary expenses and revenue 
additionally  as we bid on larger and longer term projects  the sales cycle and related sales costs have been increasing 
as a result of the above  we analyze changes in our sg a expenses in terms of the relationship between these costs and revenue expressed as a percentage of revenue rather than total dollars or percentage change in the total dollars 
other revenue includes resale of third party it hardware and software products  sales of proprietary software and commissions on sales of it products 
our sales of it hardware and software generally involve it network infrastructure 
the gross profit margin on consolidated other revenues is typically in the range of to 
this is a blend of low margin hardware sales typically a to gross margin  mid margin software sales typically a to gross margin and higher margin product commissions and proprietary software sales 
depending on the mix of these business activities  gross profit margin on other revenue will fluctuate 
the market demand for ciber s services is heavily dependent on it spending by major corporations  organizations and government entities in the markets and regions that we serve 
the pace of technological advancement and changes in business requirements and practices of our clients all have a significant impact on the demand for the services that we provide 
representing more than one third of our consolidated revenues  our international division operates primarily in western europe  but also has offices in china  russia  australia and new zealand 
as such  these operations transact business in local currencies of the countries in which they operate 
in recent years  generally to of our international division s revenue has been denominated in euros  to has been denominated in great britain pounds gbp and the balance has come from a number of other currencies 
changes in the exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
for financial reporting purposes  the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at current exchange rates at period end and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period 
our results of operations are affected by economic conditions  including macroeconomic conditions  credit market conditions and levels of business confidence 
revenue is driven by our ability to secure new contracts and deliver solutions and services that add value relevant to our clients current needs and challenges 
in recent quarters and ongoing for the foreseeable future  we have been affected by significant efforts by our clients both current and potential to implement cost savings initiatives 
these initiatives have included going to vendor management systems  taking their business to larger  pure play offshore vendors and vendor consolidation 
in some cases  these initiatives have benefited ciber  but in others we have lost our revenue stream entirely or seen a decline in our level of revenues with particular clients 
the pricing environment continues to be extremely competitive 
a number of our competitors are structuring more offshore services into their bids  thereby lowering their pricing to help clients reduce costs  and making it more difficult for us to compete on pricing 
we also have global delivery options to offer to our current and potential clients as possible cost savings  and we are expanding our offshore capabilities and increasing the usage of these resources  however  they are on a smaller scale than the offshore offerings of some of our competitors 
another issue which has had and continues to have an impact on our revenues and profitability  involves a much longer sales cycle than we have seen historically  which has been driven by a much slower decision making process in starting new projects in a variety of industries that we currently serve  or in which we are currently bidding for work 
the longer sales cycle increases the cost of our sales efforts and pushes potential revenues and profitability further into the future 
some clients remain cautious  seeking flexibility by shifting to a more phased approach to contracting for work 
in connection with our extensive strategic review completed in  we have tightened our standards governing the quality of engagements that we will accept with the goal of growing revenue  increasing margins  improving collectability of receivables and delivering sustained  predictable performance 
however  there can be no assurances that we will be successful with such actions 
economic conditions and other factors continue to impact the business operations of many of our clients  their ability to continue to use our services and their financial ability to pay for our services in full 
the impact of project cancellations cannot be accurately predicted and bad debt expense will differ from our estimates  and any such events may negatively impact our results of operations 
during the second quarter of  based on a combination of factors  including the current economic environment  our operating results and a sustained decline in our market capitalization  we recorded a million non cash goodwill impairment charge as a result of our annual goodwill impairment test 
in the same quarter  ciber also expensed million  million of which was for executive charges pertaining to the retirement of our former chief executive officer and the continuing benefits for our founder and former non executive chairman of the board  as well as million of additional costs incurred related to the leadership changes 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of  we incurred higher than usual bad debt expenses  and we reversed a large amount of project revenue previously recognized under the percentage of completion

total revenues increased million  or  for compared with constant currency adjusted revenues were approximately million higher than our reported revenues  representing a increase over our june acquisition of segmenta a s segmenta increased our current year revenues by million 
the primary contributions to the increase in current year revenue growth were from our international and us erp divisions 
revenue by segment was as follows year ended december  change in thousands international custom solutions us erp federal it outsourcing total segment revenues corporate inter segment n m total revenues n m not meaningful 
table of contents constant currency adjusted international division revenues improved 
approximately half of the international division s constant currency adjusted revenue growth related to revenues from our new german based managed services practice and the segmenta acquisition completed in june the remaining improvement was generally due to increased revenues from sap software related services  particularly in several central european countries 
constant currency adjusted revenues  excluding the impact of acquisition related revenues  increased between the comparable periods 
the decline in custom solutions revenues generally related to the ongoing financial impact from a variety of economic issues  such as customer pricing pressures  the implementation of cost saving initiatives at a number of clients  including vendor management systems  offshore services alternatives  vendor consolidation  the attrition of placements at a few larger customer accounts and the completion of several sizable projects 
all of the above resulted in either a decrease in the fees we receive for our services  or decreases in the use of our services 
additionally  we have experienced challenges in obtaining new state and local government contracts and budget issues with new projects in this sector due to the current economic climate 
increased revenues related to recently awarded new or additional work  as well as increasing demand in the healthcare vertical and related to expansion of our global delivery model  all helped to offset most of the overall revenue decrease 
the overall improvement in total revenues for our us erp division related to growth in oracle and sap projects  particularly due to strong demand in both the public and higher education sectors  as well as an increase in other product revenues related to commissions earned on the sale of it hardware plus software resales 
projected overruns on a couple of fixed price projects that are in process at year end and a project for a financially distressed client where we stopped recognizing revenue for services being delivered  both negatively impacted our current year revenue growth 
increases in sales related to low margin materials offset the declines in the federal division s services revenues from the ongoing erosion of revenue related to expired contracts  keeping total revenues basically flat between the comparable years 
current year account wins more than offset account losses and decreased product sales to maintain positive revenue growth for our it outsourcing division in the current year 
gross profit 
in total  our gross profit margin decreased basis points to for  compared to for gross margin improvements in our custom solutions and it outsourcing divisions came from better margins on new projects  plus the completion of several low margin custom solutions projects 
these improvements partially offset the declines in gross profit margin in the remaining divisions related primarily to start up of a new german based managed services practice  the increased usage of higher priced subcontractors and overruns on fixed price projects 
selling  general and administrative costs 
our sg a costs increased basis points to of revenue for  from for included in were costs of million to settle litigation  which represented basis points of sg a as a percentage of revenue 
excluding these litigation costs  our sg a costs increased basis points in compared with million  or approximately basis points of the increase  related to executive charges of million accrued in the second quarter of pertaining to the retirement of our former chief executive officer and the continuing benefits for our founder and former non executive chairman of the board  as well as million of additional costs incurred related to the leadership changes 
higher bad debt expense in also accounted for basis points of the increase 
additionally  expansion in our domestic and offshore delivery centers  including india  additional expenses from organizational transition items resulting from the recently adopted strategy of combining north american branch offices  consolidation of the sales and delivery organizations  and investments in sales training and infrastructure  as well as higher management salaries resulting from senior leadership changes  also contributed to the increase in sg a as a percentage of revenue in operating income loss 
during the second quarter of  based on a combination of factors  including the current economic environment  our operating results and a sustained decline in our market capitalization  we recorded a million non cash goodwill impairment charge following our annual goodwill impairment test 
after the goodwill impairment charge  ciber had an operating loss of million for  which also included million related to executive charges and leadership transition costs also recorded in the second quarter of  as well as million of items recorded during the fourth quarter of primarily related to higher than usual bad debt expenses  the reversal of a large amount of project revenue previously recognized under the percentage of completion method and several small legal matters

the gross margin decreases were partially offset by a reduction in sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue mainly related to reduced costs for facilities and equipment 
custom solutions operating income improved between the comparable periods due to an improvement in gross profit margin stemming from reduced work on a few large  low margin projects  new higher margin business and continued growth in lower cost offshore delivery 
the gross profit margin improvement was partially offset by increased sg a costs primarily related to our expansion in india and also in our domestic delivery centers 
us erp operating income decreased primarily due to situations involving two specific problem clients 
gross profit margin was reduced by million related to the reversal of project revenue previously recognized under the percentage of completion method due to revised estimates of project completion 
also  we did not recognize million of revenue on a project for a client whose financial condition deteriorated significantly  although we had continued to provide our services 
we also recorded million of bad debt expense to provide a full allowance for unpaid accounts receivable related to this financially distressed client 
overruns on some fixed price projects and increased usage of higher priced subcontractors also contributed to the lower operating income 
federal operating income was lower in due to a reduced gross profit margin resulting from lower margins on renewal business and increased revenue from lower margin material sales 
in addition  our federal division had million of bad debt expense for a non government project in it outsourcing operating loss improved due to better gross margins related to increased volume in some accounts and higher usage of lower priced offshore resources 
corporate expenses increased in mainly due to million of executive charges and leadership transition costs recorded during the second quarter  plus million of fourth quarter expenses that were primarily related to an additional bad debt allowance recorded for our city of new orleans receivable 
included in was a million one time charge for the settlement of litigation 
excluding these and charges  corporate expenses increased by approximately million  or basis points  primarily due to increases in salary expense related to management changes and other organization transition related expenses  as well as increased professional and consulting fees  employee benefit costs and added corporate support services

in  we had consolidated tax expense of million relating to our pre tax income of million  with an effective tax expense rate of 
our effective tax rate is significantly impacted by the changes in the amount and the geographic mix of our income and loss 
our tax rate was impacted by the goodwill impairment charge and lower domestic operating results 
in  our domestic pre tax loss was million and our foreign pre tax profit was million 
our domestic loss included the million goodwill impairment charge  which was only partially subject to taxation and resulted in a million tax benefit 
our fourth quarter tax rate also had a million benefit from the utilization of carried forward net operating losses in europe  which were previously reserved 
we estimate our blended federal and state rate to be approximately 
for our significant foreign operations  the local tax rates range from approximately to 
our actual tax expense is also impacted by the amount of non deductible expenses  which also increases our effective tax rate 
for  we are estimating an effective tax rate of to  however  this rate could fluctuate based on the factors discussed above  as well as other items 
for interim periods  we base our tax provision on forecasted book and taxable income for the entire year 
as the forecast for the year changes  we adjust our year to date tax provision 
our provision for income taxes is based on many factors and is subject to volatility from year to year 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and consolidated we translate the results of our foreign operations into us dollars from the relevant local currencies 
in periods when the us dollar is weaker  this results in a proportionately larger number of us dollars  and thus helps our results 
in us dollar terms  currency rates were favorable for ciber during the first quarters of during the fourth quarter of  we saw significant declines in foreign exchange rates as compared to the us dollar 
the strength of the us dollar remained fairly consistent throughout the first half of  only to weaken against foreign currencies during the second half of the year  making for a more favorable currency environment for ciber once again by the end of  as compared to the end of the negative impact on our financial results related to the strength of the us dollar during the first half of was partially offset by a weaker us dollar in the second half of the year  resulting in an overall decrease in revenue of approximately million in compared to the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data in dollars and expressed as a percentage of revenue year ended december  dollars in thousands consulting services other revenue total revenues gross profit consulting services gross profit other revenue gross profit total sg a expenses amortization of intangible assets operating income net income attributable to ciber  inc consultant utilization average billable headcount 
table of contents revenues 
total revenues decreased million  or  for compared to poor economic conditions and the strength of the us dollar against many currencies between the comparable periods were primarily responsible for the decline 
foreign currency rate changes resulted in a reduction in reported revenue of approximately million  or  compared with constant currency adjusted revenue decreased for compared to the global economic downturn  which began late in  led to lower overall demand for it services and products 
over much of the period from late and throughout most of  many of our clients and prospects were focused on initiatives to deliver near and medium term cost savings  and they continued to exercise caution in launching new it projects  especially larger ones  during this time frame 
many clients and prospects reduced  delayed or cancelled it spending over this same time period 
we also experienced pricing pressures from existing clients and prospects that were working hard to manage their costs 
revenue by segment was as follows year ended december  change in thousands international custom solutions us erp federal it outsourcing total segment revenues corporate inter segment n m total revenues n m not meaningful unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations accounted for a decline in our international division s current year revenue results 
constant currency adjusted international division revenue decreased by approximately 
completed projects and delays in customer decisions on new projects slowed revenue contributions in client bankruptcy and financial constraints also caused cancellation of  or reductions in some client contracts which negatively impacted the results 
custom solutions revenues decreased primarily due to the successful completion of the very large pennsylvania turnpike commission ptc project in mid  plus the normal completion of other projects  as well as a number of canceled or delayed projects and staffing reductions on other projects resulting from economic conditions during this period of time 
most significantly  some large clients cut back on the use of our services in due to strategy decisions 
we were unable to close sufficient new contracts  especially larger ones  to offset these reductions 
us erp revenues improved over in compared with several large contract wins in late and early in our oracle and sap practices were primarily responsible for the increase 
partially offsetting these contributions was the successful completion of the implementation phase of the very large ptc project mentioned above in mid we continued to provide support services to the ptc  but at considerably less revenue than during the implementation phase 
additionally  our technology solutions group incurred a million reduction in current year revenue due to slower hardware sales related to the weak economy 
federal revenues were down in as compared to related to expired contracts that have yet to be replaced 
federal had a large contract that expired at the end of and was then awarded to a qualified small business 
the federal division was successful in at winning a number of its expiring contracts where we were eligible to recompete  but delays in new contract awards have continued to push out improvements in federal revenues 
it outsourcing revenues increased in due to account growth at existing customers  plus the addition of several new clients in late and in  all of which combined more than offset a client bankruptcy  canceled project and reduced scope and spending at several other clients 

table of contents gross profit 
in total  our gross profit margin decreased basis points to for compared with for gross profit margin on consulting services revenue accounted for all of the decrease  with sizable consulting services margin decreases in all but our us erp division  which had a significant improvement over due to the turnaround in our sap practice from its poor performance in the significant declines in consulting services gross margins were primarily due to pricing pressures  which reduced pricing on our existing work  as well as lowered pricing for new competitive awards 
as customers have reduced  delayed or canceled projects  it was difficult to maintain our normal levels of consultant utilization  which also contributed to the reduction in our gross margin 
our international division also incurred an approximate employee wage increase at the beginning of that we were not able to recover through increased billing rates due to the pricing pressures mentioned above 
selling  general and administrative costs 
we began a number of cost reduction initiatives in the fall of in response to the deteriorating economic conditions 
as a result  our sg a costs for declined by million  or  compared with as a percentage of revenue  sg a costs were down basis points between the comparable annual periods 
significant cost reductions resulted from the combination of our former commercial and state local government divisions now the custom solutions division in  however  reductions were made in all divisions other than it outsourcing  which experienced increases in sg a costs primarily related to additional infrastructure to support revenue growth within that division 
overall  salary reductions represented approximately half of the annual sg a costs savings  and the remainder was achieved primarily through reductions in a number of other categories such as recruiting  training and meeting expenses and travel costs  in addition to a million decrease in bad debt expense  primarily from fewer client bankruptcies in compared with operating income 
the basis point reduction in our gross profit margin  partially offset by a basis point savings in our sg a costs  resulted in a decrease in our operating income margin to for compared to for operating income by segment was as follows year ended december  of of change revenue revenue in thousands international custom solutions us erp federal it outsourcing total segment operating income corporate expenses amortization of intangible assets total operating income segments calculated as a of segment revenue  all other calculated as a of total revenue international operating income declined due to the significant reduction in services gross profit margins stemming from lower consultant utilization and increased consultant wages  as well as some customer induced pricing pressures 
a considerable reduction in sg a costs due to lower overhead personnel costs  plus lower recruiting and travel expenses  as well as reduced bad debt expense helped to partially offset the gross margin decline 
custom solutions operating income decreased due to a substantial reduction in consulting services gross margin resulting primarily from higher margin projects that ended or were canceled and downward pricing pressure from both existing customers and new clients 
in addition  some lower margin  fixed price projects also contributed to the margin decrease 
additionally  although sg a costs decreased million in this division between the comparable years as we successfully reduced direct and overhead labor costs  we could not adjust these costs as quickly as our revenue was adjusting downward 
therefore  sg a costs as a percentage of revenue increased between the comparable periods  in part due to labor costs not reducing quickly enough  as well as increased costs for bad debt expense and higher rent expense in india 

table of contents the us erp division had significantly improved operating income in over related to improvements in both consulting services gross profit margin and reduced sg a expenses in total dollars and as a percentage of revenue 
the gross profit margin increase was led by a significant turnaround in our sap practice related to improved consultant utilization  cost reductions and completion of a large  low margin fixed price contract 
federal s operating income was down due to the erosion of gross profit margin as revenues and consultant utilization decreased and new and re compete projects were priced at lower margins than the projects they were replacing due to competitive market conditions 
additionally  the division was not able to fully offset its decreased revenue with reductions in costs as it continued to build the infrastructure required to compete for major prime contracts 
it outsourcing s operating loss increased due to both a reduction in consulting services gross profit margin  as well as an increase in sg a costs as a percentage of revenue 
this division had some fixed cost utilization issues following a late  large customer bankruptcy that prevented it from reducing its costs when the related revenue was lost 
additional infrastructure costs to accommodate future revenue growth caused most of the increase in sg a costs 
corporate expenses decreased as primarily salary related cost cutting measures were partially offset by significantly increased expenses related to the million paid in the third quarter to settle a lawsuit  including attorney fees  as well as increased share based compensation expenses and increased costs related to our new corporate headquarters 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million during  compared to  million of which related to our convertible debt  which was fully retired in december the remaining decrease was primarily due to lower average borrowings during and  to a lesser extent  due to lower average interest rates 
other income expense  net 
other income  net was million in  compared to other expense  net of million in our foreign exchange transaction gains losses accounted for a million improvement between the comparable periods 
offsetting the improvement from foreign exchange results was a million gain on the retirement of our convertible debentures during with no similar gain in income taxes 
our effective tax rate increased to for  compared to for  primarily due to additional us taxes of approximately million on a one time repatriation of cash to the us liquidity and capital resources at december   we had working capital of million and a current ratio of  compared to working capital of million and a current ratio of at december  historically  we have used our operating cash flows  available cash reserves and borrowings  as well as periodic sales of our common stock to finance ongoing operations and business combinations 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  our expected operating cash flow and our available senior credit facility will be sufficient to finance our working capital needs through at least the next year 
year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of foreign exchange rates on cash net increase in cash and cash equivalents our balance of cash and cash equivalents was million at december   compared to a balance of million at december  typically  most of our cash balance is maintained by our foreign subsidiaries and such cash is not readily available for use by our domestic operations 
any return of cash from our foreign subsidiaries is not planned for the 
table of contents foreseeable future and would likely result in significant tax consequences 
our domestic cash balances are used daily to reduce our outstanding balance on our senior credit facility 
operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared with million and million in and  respectively 
reduced earnings and changes in normal short term working capital items  primarily accounts receivable  contributed to the overall reduction in cash from operations during as compared to the prior years 
our working capital fluctuates significantly due to changes in accounts receivable discussed below  as well as due to the timing of our domestic payroll and accounts payable processing cycles with regard to month end dates and other seasonal factors 
during and  our domestic operations generated million and million  respectively  of cash from operations while our international operations generated cash from operations of million and million in and  respectively 
typically  the seasonality of our business in many european countries results in negative cash from operations in the early part of the year with improvements in the second half of the year 
cash flow from european receivables and payables are typically maximized in the fourth quarter  and annual bonuses are paid during the first quarter 
total accounts receivable increased to million at december   from million at december  total accounts receivable day s sales outstanding dso was days at december   compared to days at december  increased revenues during the fourth quarter of  primarily from domestic product sales on which we record net commission revenue  as well as from our international division  helped increase our accounts receivable balance at december   as compared to the prior year 
during  our domestic accounts receivable was negatively impacted by the timing of billing milestones on certain larger  fixed priced contracts 
we have experienced several delays in customer acceptance of applicable milestones  thereby limiting our ability to bill for our services 
at december   our unbilled accounts receivable for costs and earnings in excess of billings totaled million  which was an increase of million from the prior year 
in addition  economic conditions and other factors have negatively affected the business conditions of many of our clients  including those in the public sector  resulting in payment delays and  in some cases  increased bad debt provisions for ciber 
our international division typically experiences slower receivable payments during the first half of the year with improvement in the second half of the year  and with their lowest dso levels typically occurring in december 
changes in accounts receivable have a significant impact on our cash flow 
items that can affect our accounts receivable dso include contractual payment terms  client payment patterns including approval or processing delays and cash management  client mix public vs 
private  fluctuations in the level of it product sales and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
many of the individual reasons are outside of our control and  as a result  it is normal for our dso to fluctuate from period to period  affecting our liquidity 
accrued compensation and related liabilities fluctuate from period to period based on a couple of primary factors  including the timing of our normal bi weekly us payroll cycle and the timing of variable compensation payments 
our annual bonuses are typically accrued throughout the year and paid in the first quarter of the following year  causing some fluctuation from quarter to quarter 
accounts payable and other accrued liabilities typically fluctuate based on when we receive actual vendor invoices and when they are paid 
the largest of such items typically relates to vendor payments for it hardware and software products that we resell and payments to services related subcontractors 
investing activities 
investing activities are primarily comprised of cash paid for acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment 
in  we acquired segmenta a s  located in denmark  for million  plus we have accrued contingent consideration of million related to this acquisition at december  in  we acquired india based iteamic pvt 
ltd 
for million and in we spent million primarily for the acquisition of a norwegian sap consultancy and a noncontrolling interest in one of our european subsidiaries 
spending on property and equipment was million during  compared with million in and million in generally  our capital spending is primarily for technology equipment and software and to support our global employee base  as well as our management and corporate support infrastructure 
larger capital spending projects typically relate to periodic investments in our client support based infrastructure for our domestic and offshore delivery centers and data center operations  and such investments will fluctuate from period to period 
in  we plan to expand our delivery center operations in india  which we estimate will cost up to million  as well as make other capital investments to begin enhancing our information management systems  develop management and sales tools and work on unifying our systems globally 
financing activities 
typically  our most significant financing activities consist of the borrowings and payments under the revolving credit portion of our senior credit facility 
this fluctuates based on cash provided by  or used in  our domestic operations during the period as our cash receipts and disbursements are linked to the revolving credit facility 
during  we had net payments on our long term debt of million compared to net payments of million in and net borrowings of million in in  we used the cash proceeds of million from the sale of our common stock  as well as the positive cash flow generated by our operating activities and existing cash balances to pay down our long term debt balance 
the net borrowings in were primarily used to retire our convertible debentures 
during the year ended 
table of contents december   we used million of cash for this purpose  resulting in gains on retirement of debt of approximately million 
in  we also had an outflow of million related to the settlement of cross currency interest rate swaps 
senior credit facility 
ciber has a senior credit agreement with several financial institutions as lenders and bank of america  na as administrative agent the senior credit facility that matures on august  the credit available under the senior credit facility may be used for the working capital needs and general corporate purposes of the company 
the senior credit facility provides for an million revolving line of credit and a term loan 
the term loan balance at december   was million 
the term loan requires quarterly principal reductions of million  and therefore million of our total obligation is classified as a current liability 
ciber s remaining obligation under the senior credit facility is classified as long term debt on our consolidated balance sheets 
while we intend to amend  extend or replace this facility  unless we are able to do so through bank financing or another form of cash infusion such as stock issuance or issuance of debentures  the obligations under the senior credit facility would need to be reclassified to short term debt as of september  l 
the senior credit facility was subsequently amended on february   to modify certain financial covenants effective as of december   as well as modify other provisions 
a summary of the material provisions of the amended senior credit facility follows 
the senior credit facility is subject to mandatory prepayments and commitment reductions in amounts equal to the net cash proceeds of any asset disposition  event of loss  extraordinary receipts  issuance or incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of equity  subject in each case as appropriate to thresholds and other exceptions and definitions as specified in the credit agreement 
ciber s obligations under the senior credit facility are secured by all of ciber s present and future domestic tangible and intangible assets  as well as a pledge of of the capital stock of ciber s direct foreign subsidiaries 
subject to applicable conditions  we may elect interest rates on our senior credit facility borrowings calculated by reference to either the bank of america prime lending rate prime plus a margin that ranges from to  or a london interbank offered rate libor for one  three or six month maturities  plus a margin that ranges from to 
the applicable margins on our prime loans and libor loans are determined by reference to our current consolidated total leverage ratio 
we are also required to pay a commitment fee of per annum on the unused portion of the senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility and the related loan documents provide for the payment of other specified recurring fees and expenses  including administrative agent fees  letter of credit and other fees 
we currently have an interest rate swap that matures on march   which converts million of our borrowings under our senior credit facility from a variable rate instrument into a fixed rate instrument  plus the applicable margin 
at december   our weighted average interest rate on our outstanding borrowings under the senior credit facility  including the interest swap  was 
the terms of the senior credit facility  as amended  include among other provisions  specific limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens  stock repurchases  investments  guarantees  mergers  dispositions and acquisitions  and a prohibition on the payment of any dividends 
the senior credit facility also contains certain financial covenants  including a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio  a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  a minimum ebitda  and an asset coverage test 
a summary of these financial covenants is as follows the maximum consolidated total leverage ratio funded debt divided by ebitda may not be greater than to on december  the maximum leverage ratio increases to to on march   reduces to to on december   and reduces to to on june  the minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio ebitda minus capital expenditures divided by the sum of tax expense plus interest expense plus scheduled funded debt payments plus any restricted payments must be not less than to 
capital expenditures for exclude up to million in connection with the expansion of our india facilities 
we must maintain twelve month consolidated ebitda of at least million on december   at least million on march  and june   and at least million thereafter 
under the asset coverage test  the aggregate amount of loans advanced under the senior credit facility shall  at any time  not exceed an amount equal to of all of our net accounts receivable 
certain elements of these ratios are defined below funded debt includes borrowings under our senior credit facility  any other bank debt plus the face amount of any outstanding letters of credit  as well as any earn out and capitalized lease arrangements 

table of contents ebitda represents the sum of net income or net loss  net interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation expense  amortization expense  share based compensation expense  cash separation costs not to exceed million and other cash transitional costs not to exceed million related to the departure of our former chief executive officer and former non executive chairman of the board of directors  non cash goodwill impairment charges not to exceed million in the aggregate  plus up to million of charges taken during the quarter ended december   primarily related to accounts receivable and unbilled revenue balances  as well as several other legal settlement items  measured over the twelve month period ending as of the end of each fiscal quarter 
we are required to be in compliance with the financial covenants at the end of each calendar quarter  and we were in compliance with these financial covenants as of december   with the following calculations for our financial covenant ratios consolidated total leverage ratio to maximum permitted to consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio to minimum permitted to consolidated ebitda million minimum permitted million asset coverage test million not to exceed million based on management s current estimates  we do not currently believe a covenant violation to be probable of occurring for at least the next months 
however  given the current volatile economic conditions  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be in compliance with these bank covenants 
if a covenant violation were to occur  we believe that we would be able to obtain a waiver or amendment from our credit group 
any such waiver or amendment would come at additional costs to ciber and such costs could be material 
we believe that other sources of credit or financing would be available to us  however  we cannot predict at this time what types of credit or financing will be available in the future  or the costs of such credit or financing 
at december   we had outstanding borrowings of million under the senior credit facility 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any reportable off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments 
changes in our business needs  cancellation provisions  changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments differing from these estimates 
we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments 
we have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our information within the context of our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the following table is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total thereafter in thousands principal payments on long term debt interest payments on long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total interest payments were calculated based on terms of the related agreements and effective interest rates as of december   for our borrowings 
includes operating leases for all office locations  automobiles and office equipment 
at december   we had gross unrecognized tax benefits of million 
we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when a cash settlement  if any  with the appropriate taxing authority may occur  as such  our unrecognized tax benefits are not included in the table above 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
we continually evaluate our estimates  judgments and assumptions based on available information and experience 
we believe that our estimates  judgments and assumptions are reasonable based on information available to us at the time they are made 
to the extent there are differences between our estimates  judgments and assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
such differences may be material to our financial statements 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates  judgments and assumptions are described below 
revenue recognition ciber earns revenue primarily from providing it services to its clients  and to a much lesser extent  from the sale and resale of it hardware and software products 
ciber s consulting services revenue comes from three primary sources technology integration services where we design  build and implement new or enhanced system applications and related processes  general it consulting services  such as system selection or assessment  feasibility studies  training and staffing  and outsourcing and managed it services in which we manage  staff  maintain  host or otherwise run solutions and or systems provided to our customers 
contracts for these services have different terms based on the scope  deliverables and complexity of the engagement  which requires management to make judgments and estimates in recognizing revenue 
fees for these contracts may be in the form of time and materials or fixed price billings 
the majority of our consulting services revenue is recognized under time and materials contracts as hours and costs are incurred 
consulting services revenue also includes project related reimbursable expenses for travel and other out of pocket expenses separately billed to clients 
revenue for technology integration consulting services where we design redesign  build and implement new or enhanced systems applications and related processes for our clients is generally recognized based on the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  management estimates the percentage of completion based upon the contract costs incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated contract costs 
if the total cost estimate exceeds revenue  we accrue for the estimated loss immediately 
the use of the percentage of completion method requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract revenue and costs  including assumptions as to the length of time to complete the project  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and anticipated changes in estimated costs 
estimates of total contract costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract and recorded revenues and costs are subject to revision as the contract progresses 
such revisions may result in increases or decreases to revenue and income and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which they are first identified 
revenue for general it consulting services is recognized as work is performed and amounts are earned 
we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  services are delivered  fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
for contracts with fees based on time and materials or cost plus  we recognize revenue over the period of performance 
for fixed price contracts  depending on the specific contractual provisions and nature of the deliverables  revenue may be recognized on a proportional performance model based on level of effort  as milestones are achieved or when final deliverables have been provided 
outsourcing and managed it services arrangements typically span several years 
revenue from time and materials contracts is recognized as the services are performed 
revenue from unit priced contracts is recognized as transactions are processed based on objective measures of output 
revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized on a straight line basis  unless revenues are earned and obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
costs related to delivering outsourcing and managed services are expensed as incurred  with the exception of labor and other direct costs related to the set up of processes  personnel and systems  which are deferred during the transition period and expensed evenly over the period services are provided 
amounts billable to the client for transition or set up activities  which do not have standalone value  are also deferred and recognized as revenue evenly over the period that the managed services are provided 
we sometimes enter into arrangements excluding software license arrangements with customers that purchase multiple services  or a combination of services and it hardware products  from us at the same time  referred to as multiple element arrangements 
each element within a multiple element arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting provided that the delivered services or products have value to the customer on a standalone basis 
we consider a deliverable element to have standalone value if the service or product is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer 
for our multiple element arrangements  the arrangement consideration is allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverable elements on the basis of their relative selling price the relative selling price method 
when applying the relative selling price method  the selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price if it exists  otherwise  third party evidence tpe of selling price is used 
if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling 
table of contents price exists for a deliverable  then we use our best estimate of the selling price esp for that deliverable when applying the relative selling price method 
since our services are typically customized to each client s specific needs  vsoe and tpe are generally not available 
we determine esp for purposes of allocating the arrangement by considering several external and internal factors including  but not limited to  pricing practices  margin objectives  competition  geographies in which we offer our products and services  and internal costs 
as the result of new accounting guidance  we adopted the use of esp in and this change was not material to our financial results 
we limit the amount of revenue recognized for delivered elements to an amount that is not contingent upon future delivery of additional services or products 
other revenue primarily includes resale of third party it hardware and software products  commissions on sales of it products and  to a lesser extent  sales of proprietary software products 
revenue related to the sale of it products is generally recognized when the products are shipped or if applicable  when delivered and installed in accordance with the terms of the sale 
where we are the re marketer of certain it products  commission revenue is recognized when the products are drop shipped from the vendor to the customer 
our commission revenue represents the sales price to the customer less the cost paid to the vendor 
some software license arrangements also include implementation services and or post contract customer support 
in such multi element software arrangements  if the criteria are met  revenue is recognized based on the vsoe of the fair value of each element 
if a software license arrangement containing multiple elements does not qualify for separate accounting for the implementation services  then the software license revenue and the related costs of third party software products are generally recognized together with the software implementation services using the percentage of completion method 
revenue for software post contract support is recognized ratably over the term of the related agreement 
unbilled accounts receivable represent amounts recognized as revenue based on services performed in advance of billings in accordance with contract terms 
under our typical time and materials billing arrangement  we bill our customers on a regularly scheduled basis  such as biweekly or monthly 
at the end of each accounting period  we accrue revenue for services performed since the last billing cycle 
these unbilled amounts are generally billed the following month 
unbilled accounts receivable also arise when percentage of completion accounting is used and costs plus estimated contract earnings exceed billings 
such amounts are billed at specific milestone dates or at contract completion 
management expects all unbilled accounts receivable to be collected within one year of the balance sheet date 
billings in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue and are primarily comprised of deferred software support revenue 
goodwill we perform our annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of june each year or more often if there are indicators of impairment present 
we test each of our reporting units for goodwill impairment 
our reporting units are the same as our operating divisions and reporting segments 
the goodwill impairment test requires a two step process 
the first step consists of comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  then it is not considered impaired and no further analysis is required 
if step one indicates that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  then impairment potentially exists and the second step is performed to measure the amount of goodwill impairment 
goodwill impairment exists when the estimated implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill is less than its carrying value 
we compared the carrying value of each of our five reporting units to its estimated fair value at june  we estimated the fair value of each of our reporting units based on a weighting of both the income approach and the market approach 
the discounted cash flows for each reporting unit that served as the primary basis for the income approach were based on discrete financial forecasts developed by management 
cash flows beyond the discrete forecast period of five years were estimated using the perpetuity growth method calculation 
the average annual revenue growth rates forecasted for each reporting unit for the first five years of our projections ranged between and  with an overall weighted average of 
we project operating profit margins to return to historical norms by in the individual reporting units as we expect the it industry to recover over the next few years  and we expect to obtain margin benefits from a number of internal initiatives 
the terminal value was calculated assuming projected growth rates of after five years  which reflects our estimate of minimum long term growth in it spending 
the income approach valuations also included reporting unit cash flow discount rates  which represented each reporting unit s estimated weighted average cost of capital and ranged from to 
the market approach applied pricing multiples derived from publicly traded companies that are comparable to the respective reporting unit to determine its value 
we utilized enterprise value revenue multiples ranging from to and enterprise value ebitda multiples ranging from to in order to value each of our reporting units under the market approach 
also  the fair value under the market approach included a control premium of 
the control premium was determined based on a review of comparative market transactions 
publicly available information regarding our market capitalization was also considered in assessing the reasonableness of the cumulative fair values of our reporting units 
as a result of the first step of our goodwill impairment test as of june   we estimated that the fair value for our international  us erp and it outsourcing reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts by  and  respectively  thus no impairment was indicated 
we also determined that the estimated fair values of our custom solutions and 
table of contents federal reporting units were less than their respective carrying amounts by and  respectively  indicating impairment may exist for these divisions 
because indicators of impairment existed for our custom solutions and federal reporting units  we performed the second step of the test to determine the implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit 
the estimated implied fair value of goodwill was determined in a consistent manner utilized to estimate the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
as a result  we calculated the estimated fair value of certain non recorded assets  including customer relationships and trade name 
the implied fair value of goodwill was measured as the excess of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities 
the impairment loss for each reporting unit was measured by the amount that the carrying value of goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the goodwill 
based on this assessment  we recorded an impairment charge of million million for custom solutions and million for federal in  which represented of the custom solutions and of the federal reporting units goodwill prior to the impairment charge  respectively 
the impairment charge is primarily a result of the impact that the depressed economic environment had on overall equity values and its negative impact on our operations and forecasted cash flows  as well as the sustained decline in our market capitalization 
we have adjusted our forecasted cash flows and the other assumptions used to calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units to account for our beliefs and expectations of the current macro economic environment 
while we believe our estimates are appropriate based on our view of current business trends  as discussed further below  no assurance can be provided that additional impairment charges will not be required in the future 
we currently have a remaining goodwill balance of million at december  the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting units for the purpose of our annual or periodic goodwill impairment analysis  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of the reporting units  including estimated growth rates and assumptions about the economic environment 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying reporting units  there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these reporting units 
in addition  we make certain judgments about allocating shared assets  such as cash and property and equipment  to the balance sheet for the reporting units 
we also consider our market capitalization  adjusted for unallocated monetary assets such as cash  debt  a control premium and other factors determined by management 
as a result  several factors could result in the impairment of a material amount of our goodwill balance in future periods  including  but not limited to further weakening of the global economy  continued weakness in the it services industry  or failure of ciber to reach our internal forecasts could impact our ability to achieve our forecasted levels of cash flows and reduce the estimated discounted cash flow value of our reporting units  a decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization  if we determine that the decline is sustained and is indicative of a reduction in the fair value of any of our reporting units below their carrying values 
adverse changes in our market capitalization  long term forecasts and industry growth rates could result in additional impairment charges being recorded in future periods for goodwill attributed to our custom solutions  federal or other reporting units 
any future impairment charges would adversely affect our results of operations for those periods 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
as a global company  we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction  as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed 
we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the provision for income tax expense 
in the event there is a significant unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes will affect our overall effective tax rate 
we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities  and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes plus interest and possible penalties 
tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law  we believe it is more likely than not that all or some 
table of contents portion of a tax benefit will not be realized as the result of an audit 
we evaluate these reserves each quarter and adjust the reserves and the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances regarding the estimates of tax benefits to be realized  such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations 
we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are reasonable 
however  final determinations of prior year tax liabilities  either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations  could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions 
the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision  net income or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made 
we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for any known tax contingencies 
no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested 
if future events  including material changes in estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements  necessitate that these earnings be distributed  an additional provision for withholding taxes may apply  which could materially affect our future effective tax rate 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to cover the risk of collecting less than full payment on our receivables 
at december   we had gross accounts receivable of million and our allowance for doubtful accounts was million 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon specific identification of probable losses 
we review our accounts receivable and reassess our estimates of collectability each quarter 
historically  our bad debt expense has been a very small percentage of our total revenue  as most of our revenues are from large  credit worthy global blue chip companies and government agencies 
since  as global economic conditions worsened  and we have taken on certain riskier clients  we have experienced a higher number of client bankruptcies  clients with financial difficulties and clients refusing to pay for services 
our bad debt expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  five clients accounted for of our total bad debt expense 
if our clients financial condition or liquidity were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if customers were to express dissatisfaction with the services we have provided  additional allowances may be required 
such items are very difficult to predict and require significant management judgment 
accrued compensation and certain other accrued liabilities employee compensation costs are our largest expense category 
we have several different variable compensation programs  which are highly dependent on estimates and judgments  particularly at interim reporting dates 
some programs are discretionary  while others have quantifiable performance metrics 
certain programs are annual  while others are quarterly or monthly 
often actual compensation amounts cannot be determined until after our results are reported 
we believe we make reasonable estimates and judgments using all significant information available 
in addition  the process to estimate the fair value of share based compensation also involves various assumptions  inputs and judgments 
we estimate the amounts required for incurred but not reported health claims under our self insured employee benefit programs 
our accrual for health costs is based on historical experience and specific claim activity and actual amounts may vary 
in connection with an acquisition  we have agreed to certain possible future contingent consideration to be paid to the sellers based upon the financial performance of the acquired operations during the month period after the acquisition 
we are required to estimate the value of such contingent consideration 
we estimate the contingent consideration liability based on a probability weighted approach derived from management s own estimates of profitability and sales targets 
in the ordinary course of business  we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
we periodically review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
we use significant judgment in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information at that time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of potential liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we expense legal fees as incurred 
other intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions  we are required to recognize other intangible assets separate and apart from goodwill  if such assets arise from contractual or other legal rights or if such assets are separable from the acquired business 
other intangible assets primarily include  among other things  customer related assets such as order backlog  customer contracts and customer relationships 
determining a fair value for such items requires a high degree of judgment  assumptions and estimates 
we often use third parties to assist us with such valuations 
in addition  these intangible assets are amortized over our best estimate of their useful life 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we believe our exposure to other market risks is immaterial 
during  approximately  or million of our total revenue was attributable to our foreign operations 
using sensitivity analysis  a hypothetical increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would change total revenue by  or million 
a portion of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency 
additionally  we have exposure to changes in foreign currency rates related to short term inter company transactions with our foreign subsidiaries and from client receivables in different currencies 
foreign sales are mostly made by our foreign subsidiaries in their respective countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
our foreign subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in their local currency as well  which helps minimize our risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
our exposure to changes in interest rates arises primarily because our indebtedness under our senior credit facility has a variable interest rate 
at december   our outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility were million 
we currently have an interest rate swap that matures on march   which converts million of our borrowings under our senior credit facility from a variable rate instrument into a fixed rate instrument  plus the applicable margin 
at december   our weighted average interest rate on our outstanding borrowings under the senior credit facility  including the interest swap  was 
assuming million of outstanding borrowings  of which million is fixed rate due to the interest rate swap  a increase in interest rates would result in approximately million of additional interest expense
