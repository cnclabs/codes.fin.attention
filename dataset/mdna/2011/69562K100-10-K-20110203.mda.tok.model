item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report 
operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company that develops novel drugs 
our lead drug candidate is called remoxy 
remoxy is a strong painkiller with a unique formulation designed to reduce potential risks of unintended use 
remoxy and other abuse resistant painkillers are being developed pursuant to a strategic alliance we have with king 
in october  pfizer and king announced that pfizer would acquire king 
pfizer plans to complete its acquisition of king in late february we believe pfizer s acquisition of king may facilitate remoxy s commercial success if remoxy is approved 
we and king jointly managed a phase iii clinical program and nda submission for remoxy 
in mid  the fda accepted our nda for remoxy with priority review 
in december  we received from the fda a complete response letter for the nda for remoxy 
in this complete response letter  the fda indicated additional non clinical data was required to support the approval of remoxy 
the fda has not requested or recommended additional clinical efficacy studies prior to approval 
in  king assumed sole responsibility for the regulatory approval of remoxy 
this shift of responsibility did not change any economic term of our strategic alliance with king 
in december  we and king announced that king had resubmitted the remoxy nda 
in january  we announced that the fda had accepted king s resubmission of the remoxy nda 
in january  we announced that the fda had accepted the ind for the fourth product candidate  abuse resistant oxymorphone  under our strategic alliance with king 
in january  king paid us a million milestone payment for this milestone 
we recorded milestone revenue for this milestone payment in the fourth quarter of we are also developing a pipeline of novel drug candidates in the area of oncology and hematology 
we own all commercial rights to our pipeline of drug candidates in oncology and hematology 
we are developing a novel drug candidate called pti to treat metastatic melanoma  a deadly form of skin cancer 
pti is a monoclonal antibody linked to a radioisotope  intended to deliver doses of radiation lethal to melanoma tumors without harming normal tissue 
in march  we announced data from two open label  dose escalating phase i studies conducted in israel to assess the safety  pharmacokinetics  dosimetry and anti tumor activity of pti the first phase i study was completed in and we announced preliminary data from that study in the second study was completed in early in both studies  patients were enrolled with confirmed stage iv or unresectable stage iii melanoma 
all patients were treated with a single intravenous dose of pti anti tumor effects were measured at baseline  post treatment at weeks two and six  and monthly thereafter 
among evaluable patients at the time of our announcement  top line preliminary results confirm the preliminary safety and biological activity of pti we have a gene transfer program  initially developed at stanford university  aimed at correcting an underlying genetic defect in patients with hemophilia  a genetic disorder in which patients are unable to stop bleeding 
during and  we conducted a variety of pre clinical studies with this technology 
we have licensed exclusive worldwide commercial rights to the technology used in this program from poetic genetics  llc  or poetic 
all of our collaboration  contract and milestone revenues are recognized pursuant to our strategic alliance with king 
in  king made an upfront cash payment of million to us 
we will receive a million cash milestone payment from king upon regulatory approval of remoxy in the united states 
in january   we received million from king for the acceptance by the fda of the ind for abuse resistant 
table of contents oxymorphone 
in  we received million related to acceptance by the fda of the nda for remoxy  and million of acceptance by the fda of the ind for abuse resistant hydrocodone 
in  we received million for the acceptance by the fda of the ind for abuse resistant hydromorphone 
we could also receive from king up to million in additional milestone payments in the course of clinical development of the other abuse resistant opioid painkillers under the strategic alliance 
subject to certain limitations  king is also obligated to fund development expenses incurred by us pursuant to the collaboration agreement 
king is obligated to fund the commercialization expenses of  and has the exclusive right to market and sell  drugs developed in connection with the strategic alliance 
the royalty rate for net sales of remoxy and other products covered by the strategic alliance with king in the united states is  except as to the first billion in cumulative net sales in the united states  for which the royalty is set at 
the royalty rate for net sales of products covered by the strategic alliance with king outside the united states is 
although we were profitable in  and based on payments received from king and interest income  we have yet to generate any revenues from product sales 
through december   we have recorded an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
these losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with research and development activities  salaries and other personnel related costs and general corporate expenses 
research and development activities include costs of preclinical and clinical trials as well as clinical supplies associated with our drug candidates 
salaries and other personnel related costs include non cash stock based compensation associated with options and other equity awards granted to employees and non employees 
our operating results may fluctuate substantially from period to period as a result of the timing and enrollment rates of clinical trials for our drug candidates and our need for clinical supplies 
we expect to continue to use significant cash resources in our operations for the next several years 
our cash requirements for operating activities and capital expenditures will increase substantially in the future as we continue to conduct preclinical and clinical trials for our drug candidates  seek regulatory approvals for our drug candidates  develop  formulate  manufacture and commercialize our drug candidates  implement additional internal systems and develop new infrastructure  acquire or in license additional products or technologies  or expand the use of our technology  maintain  defend and expand the scope of our intellectual property  and hire additional personnel 
product revenue will depend on our ability to receive regulatory approvals for  and successfully market  our drug candidates 
if our development efforts result in regulatory approval and successful commercialization of our drug candidates  we will generate revenue from direct sales of our drugs and or  if we license our drugs to future collaborators  from the receipt of license fees and royalties from sales of licensed products 
we conduct our research and development programs through a combination of internal and collaborative programs 
we rely on arrangements with universities  our collaborators  contract research organizations and clinical research sites for a significant portion of our product development efforts 

table of contents we focus substantially all our research and development efforts on the research and development of drugs for the treatment of pain  metastatic melanoma and hemophilia 
the following table summarizes expenses by category for research and development efforts in thousands years ended december  compensation contractor fees supplies other common costs contractor fees generally include expenses for preclinical studies and clinical trials 
supplies generally include costs for formulation and manufacturing activities 
other generally includes the allocation of common costs such as facilities 
our technology has been applied across certain of our portfolio of drug candidates 
data  know how  personnel  clinical results  research results and other matters related to the research and development of any one of our drug candidates also relate to  and further the development of  our other drug candidates 
for example  we expect that results of non clinical studies  such as pharmacokinetics  toxicology and other studies  regarding certain components of our drug candidate remoxy to be applicable to the other potential drug candidates that may arise out of our collaboration with king since all such potential drug candidates are expected to utilize such components 
as a result  costs allocated to a specific drug candidate may not necessarily reflect the actual costs surrounding research and development of that drug candidate due to cross application of the foregoing 
we spent approximately million in  million in  and million in on pti  primarily in compensation in and contractor fees and compensation in and we spent approximately million in  million in  and million in on hemophilia and other projects  primarily in compensation in and contractor fees and compensation in and estimating the dates of completion of clinical development  and the costs to complete development  of our drug candidates would be highly speculative  subjective and potentially misleading 
pharmaceutical products take a significant amount of time to research  develop and commercialize 
the clinical trial portion of the development of a new drug alone usually spans several years 
we expect to reassess our future research and development plans based on our review of data we receive from our current research and development activities 
the cost and pace of our future research and development activities are linked and subject to change 
in december  we paid our stockholders a special  one time non dividend distribution of per share totaling approximately million 
we intend to relocate our principal place of business to austin  texas 
in order to minimize potential disruptions to our on going operations  this relocation will take place gradually now through the end of our intentions are to shift our permanent headquarters and the entire actual direction  control  and coordination of our operations  from california to texas 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and interest income in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those estimates related to agreements  research collaborations and investments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be 
table of contents reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following items in our financial statements require significant estimates and judgments expenses for clinical trials 
we incur expenses for clinical trials from the planning phase through patient enrollment to reporting of the underlying data 
we estimate expenses incurred for clinical trials that are in process based on patient enrollment and based on clinical data collection and management 
costs that are associated with patient enrollment are recognized as each patient in the clinical trial completes enrollment 
estimated clinical trial costs related to enrollment can vary based on numerous factors  including expected number of patients in trials  the number of patients that do not complete participation in a trial  and when a patient drops out of a trial 
information about patient enrollment can become available significantly after we report our expenses for clinical trials  in which case we would change our estimate of the remaining cost of a trial 
costs that are based on clinical data collection and management are recognized based on estimates of unbilled goods and services received 
in the event of early termination of a clinical trial  we would accrue an amount based on estimates of the remaining non cancelable obligations associated with winding down the clinical trial 
stock based compensation 
we recognize expense in the statement of operations for the fair value of all share based payments to employees and directors  including grants of employee stock options and other share based awards 
for stock options  we use the black scholes option valuation model and the single option award approach and straight line attribution method 
using this approach  the compensation cost is amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of each respective stock option  generally four years 
we estimate forfeitures and adjust this estimate periodically based on the extent to which future actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from such estimates 
we have granted share based awards that vest upon achievement of certain performance criteria  or performance awards 
the value of these awards is the product of the number of shares of our common stock to be issued under the award multiplied by the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of grant 
these awards include future performance conditions 
we estimate an implicit service period for achieving these performance conditions 
performance awards vest and common stock is issued on achieving performance conditions 
we recognize stock based compensation expense for performance awards when we conclude that achieving a performance condition is probable 
we periodically review and update as appropriate our estimates of the implicit service periods and the likelihood of achieving the performance conditions 
revenue recognition and deferred program fee revenue 
we recognize program fee revenue  collaboration revenue and milestone revenue in connection with our strategic alliance with king 
program fee revenue is derived from upfront payments from king  including the million paid to us at the beginning of the strategic alliance and the million king paid us in july in connection with an amendment to our strategic alliance 
these payments are recognized from receipt ratably over our estimate of the development period for the fourth of four drug candidates expected to be developed under the strategic alliance with king 
we currently estimate the development period for all four expected drug candidates to end in the quarter ended september  we review the estimated development period on a quarterly basis and change it if appropriate based upon our latest expectations 
in the first quarter of we determined that our estimate of the development period should be extended from the third quarter of collaboration revenues from reimbursement of development expenses pursuant to our collaboration agreement with king are generally recognized when king has completed its review of the expenses invoiced to them 
king is obligated to pay us milestone payments contingent upon the achievement of certain substantive events in the development of remoxy and the other opioid painkillers under the strategic alliance 
we recognize milestone payments from king as revenue when we achieve the underlying developmental milestone as the milestone payments are not dependent upon any other future activities or achievement of any other future milestones and the achievement of each of the developmental milestones were substantively at risk and contingent at the 
table of contents effective date of the collaboration 
substantial effort is involved in achieving each of the developmental milestones 
these milestones represent the culmination of discrete earnings processes and the amount of each milestone payment is reasonable in relation with the level of effort associated with the achievement of the milestone 
each milestone payment is non refundable and non creditable when made 
the ongoing research and development services being provided to king under the collaboration are priced at fair value based upon the reimbursement of expenses incurred pursuant to the collaboration with king 
taxes 
we make estimates and judgments in determining the need for a provision for income taxes  including the estimation of our taxable income or loss for each full fiscal year 
we have accumulated significant deferred tax assets 
deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of net operating loss and tax credit carryovers and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any 
we are uncertain as to the timing and amount of any future earnings 
accordingly  we offset these net deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance 
we may in the future determine that more of our deferred tax assets will likely be realized  in which case we will reduce our valuation allowance in the quarter in which such determination is made 
if the valuation allowance is reduced  we may recognize a benefit from income taxes in our statement of operations in that period 
we classify interest recognized in connection with our tax positions as interest expense  when appropriate 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue program fee revenue king paid us a million upfront fee in connection with the closing of our strategic alliance with king in december revenues recognized from amortization of this upfront fee were million in and million in we expect to recognize the rest of the program fee ratably over our estimate of the remainder of the development period under the strategic alliance with king 
we currently estimate the development period for all four expected drug candidates to extend through september revenue collaboration revenue collaboration revenues were million in and million in these revenues related to reimbursement of our development expenses incurred pursuant to the king strategic alliance 
collaboration revenues were lower in as compared to primarily because the reimbursable expenses we incurred pursuant to the strategic alliance with king were lower in as compared to we expect the amount and timing of collaboration revenue to fluctuate in relation to the amount and timing of the underlying research and development expenses  as well as the timing of completion of king s review of submitted expenses 
revenue milestone revenue milestone revenue of million in was related acceptance by the fda of the ind for abuse resistant oxymorphone under our strategic alliance with king 
research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of costs of drug development work associated with our drug candidates  including preclinical testing  
table of contents clinical trials  clinical supplies and related formulation and design costs  and salaries and other personnel related expenses 
in october  we were awarded million in research grants by the us government under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program 
the research grants were awarded following a competitive review of thousands of applications 
according to guidance released by the us department of the treasury  the us department of health and human services evaluated each project for its potential to produce new therapies  reduce long term health care costs or cure cancer 
we recognized these grants as a reduction in research and development expenses for the fourth quarter research and development expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to decreases in development activities for remoxy  the timing of development activities for our other product candidates and reduction in research and development costs for grants awarded to us by the us government  offset in part by increased non cash stock related compensation costs 
research and development expenses included non cash stock related compensation costs of million in and million in these costs in included million for one time modifications made to outstanding stock options to prevent diminution of the benefit of these options from the special  one time nondividend distribution to stockholders in the fourth quarter of we expect non cash stock related compensation costs to decrease in we expect our development efforts to result in our drug candidates progressing through various stages of clinical trials  including current and potential clinical trials for our other abuse resistant drug candidates  as well as further clinical development of our product candidates in metastatic melanoma and hemophilia 
king is obligated to reimburse certain development expenses for our abuse resistant drug candidates pursuant to our collaboration agreement 
our research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and scope of our development activities and the results of clinical trials and preclinical studies 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to increases in non cash stock related compensation costs 
general and administrative expenses included non cash stock related compensation costs of million in and million in these costs in included million for one time modifications made to outstanding stock options to prevent diminution of the benefit of these options from the special  one time nondividend distribution to stockholders in the fourth quarter of we expect non cash stock related compensation costs to decrease in we expect other general and administrative expenses to increase over the next several years in connection with support of precommercialization and commercialization activities for our drug candidates 
the increase may fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and scope of these activities and the results of clinical trials and preclinical studies 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to decreased average balances of marketable securities and to a lesser extent decreases in prevailing interest rates on investments in marketable securities 
we expect our interest income to decrease in the future because of the nondividend distribution we made to stockholders in december and as we use cash to fund our operations 

table of contents benefit from income taxes we did not provide for income taxes in because we have projected a tax loss for the full year our benefit from income taxes in was due to our election to carryback our tax loss for to prior years 
years ended december  and revenue program fee revenue king paid us a million upfront fee in connection with the closing of our strategic alliance with king in december revenues recognized from amortization of this upfront fee were million in and revenue collaboration revenue collaboration revenues were million in and million in these revenues related to reimbursement of our development expenses incurred pursuant to the king strategic alliance 
collaboration revenues were lower in as compared to primarily because the reimbursable expenses we incurred pursuant to the strategic alliance with king were lower in as compared to research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of costs of drug development work associated with our drug candidates  including preclinical testing  clinical trials  clinical supplies and related formulation and design costs  and salaries and other personnel related expenses 
research and development expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to decreases in clinical and development activities for remoxy as well as the assumption in by king of primary regulatory responsibility for remoxy  partially offset by increased activities in metastatic melanoma  hemophilia and other projects 
research and development expenses included non cash stock related compensation costs of million in and million in general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to decreases in non cash stock related compensation costs 
general and administrative expenses included non cash stock related compensation costs of million in and million in interest and other income  net interest and other income  net  decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to decreases in prevailing interest rates on investments in marketable securities and  to a lesser extent  decreased average balances of marketable securities 

table of contents benefit from income taxes we did not provide for income taxes in because we did not have taxable income in our benefit from income taxes in was due to our election to carryback our tax loss for to prior years 
interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were immaterial for and in we had an income tax benefit of million comprised of a federal tax benefit of million  net of a provision for state taxes of million 
the federal income tax benefit is primarily due to the recognition in of previously generated net operating losses and tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through public and private stock offerings  payments received under our strategic alliance with king and interest earned on our investments 
we intend to continue to use our capital resources to fund research and development activities  capital expenditures  working capital requirements and other general corporate purposes 
as of december   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million 
net cash used in operating activities was million for compared to million for this decrease was primarily due to receipt of million in from king in connection with our strategic alliance  tax refunds received in and lower cash based operating expenses in as compared to net cash provided by investing activities was million for compared to million used in investing activities for investing activities for both years consisted primarily of the purchase and sale of marketable securities 
we did not use any cash to purchase property  equipment and leasehold improvements in and we expect to continue to invest in our infrastructure to support our operations 
net cash used by financing activities was million in and net cash provided by financing activities was million for in december  we paid our stockholders a special  one time nondividend distribution of per share totaling approximately million 
other cash from financing activities in both and consisted primarily of cash from stock issued pursuant to our equity incentive plan and our employee stock purchase plan 
in february  we received a federal tax refund of million from a portion of taxes paid for when we filed our federal tax return for  we elected to carryback part of our federal tax loss for against all federal taxes paid for and the remaining portion of federal taxes paid for in april  we received an additional federal tax refund of million from our election to carryback the tax loss 
our election to carryback our tax loss to and eliminated the use of federal tax credits to reduce our federal tax liability for both and as a result  our deferred tax liabilities decreased by million and our current assets related to our deferred tax assets decreased by million 
realization of our other deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings  if any 
we are uncertain about the timing and amount of any future earnings 
accordingly  we offset these net deferred tax assets with a valuation allowance 
there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions 
our liability at december  related to our uncertain tax positions is immaterial 
in early  we received million in grants awarded to us in under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program 
in  we were selected for an audit of our federal tax return 
this audit was completed in early with no changes in any of our tax positions 

table of contents we currently lease approximately  square feet of general office space pursuant to a non cancelable operating lease that will expire in future minimum lease payments for our lease are million for and million for we are considering the possibility of leasing additional general office space in austin  texas in we believe that our facilities are adequate and suitable for our current needs 
we have license agreements that require us to make milestone payments upon the successful achievement of milestones  including clinical milestones 
our license agreements also require us to pay certain royalties to our licensors if we succeed in fully commercializing products under these license agreements 
all of these potential future payments are cancelable as of december  our formulation agreement with durect corporation obligates us to make certain milestone payments upon achieving clinical milestones and regulatory milestones 
king is obligated to reimburse us for any of our milestone payments and royalty payments to durect corporation 
we have an accumulated deficit of million at december  we expect our cash requirements to be significant in the future 
the amount and timing of our future cash requirements will depend on regulatory and market acceptance of our drug candidates and the resources we devote to researching and developing  formulating  manufacturing  commercializing and supporting our products 
we believe that our current resources should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
we may seek additional future funding through public or private financing within this timeframe  if such funding is available and on terms acceptable to us 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
therefore  we are not materially exposed to financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
we do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  by approximately million 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  government and non government debt securities and or money market funds that invest in such securities 
we have no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments 
as of december   our investments consisted of investments in corporate and government notes and obligations or in money market accounts and checking funds with variable market rates of interest 
we believe our credit risk is immaterial
