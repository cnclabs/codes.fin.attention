we expect to use these amounts to fund our international operations and international expansion activities 
the marketable securities at may   consist of canadian treasury securities 
we believe that our investment policy pertaining to marketable securities is conservative 
the criterion used in making investment decisions is the preservation of principal  while earning an attractive yield 
cash flows provided by operating activities have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity 
we generally use these cash flows to fund most  if not all  of our operations and expansion activities and dividends on our common stock 
we may also use cash flows provided by operating activities  as well as proceeds from long term debt and short term borrowings  to fund growth and expansion opportunities  as well as other cash requirements such as share buybacks 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  a decrease of million compared to fiscal net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal benefited from lower working capital needs associated with our decreasing sales volumes and the accrual of approximately million in legal settlements 
as sales volumes have increased in fiscal  our working capital needs increased 
our operating cash flows were negatively impacted by the accounts receivable increase of million and the inventories  net and uniforms and other rental items in service increase of million  both due to the higher sales volume and a planned increase in inventory in anticipation of a planned enterprise wide system conversion of the cintas global supply chain division

we completed the may  share buyback program by purchasing million shares of cintas common stock for a total of million of cintas common stock by the end of september  on october   we announced that the board of directors authorized an additional million share buyback program at market prices 
beginning in april  under this new program  we purchased million shares of cintas common stock for a purchase price of million which resulted in a total of million of cintas common stock through may  we completed the october  share buyback program by purchasing an additional million shares of cintas common stock in june and july for million 
from the inception of the october  share buyback program through july   cintas has purchased a total of million shares of cintas common stock at an average price of per share for a total purchase price of million 
for the fiscal year ended may   cintas purchased approximately  shares of cintas common stock in trade for employee payroll taxes due on restricted stock awards that vested during the fiscal year 
these shares were purchased at an average price of per share for a total purchase price of approximately million 
we paid an annual cash dividend of million  or per share  in december on a per share basis  this dividend is an increase of over the dividend paid in fiscal this marks the th consecutive year that cintas has increased its annual dividend  every year since going public in as of may   we had  million in fixed rate senior notes outstanding with maturities ranging from to on may   cintas issued million of senior notes due bearing an interest rate of and an additional million of senior notes due bearing an interest rate of 
the interest on both tranches of these senior notes will be paid semi annually beginning december  the net proceeds generated from the offerings were used to repay our outstanding commercial paper borrowings  purchase shares of cintas common stock under the october  share buyback program and other general corporate purchases

during fiscal  cintas initiated a million loan with pidc regional center  lp for funding related to a facility being built in philadelphia 
it is a year note with a interest rate 
cintas has a commercial paper program with capacity of million that is fully supported by a backup revolving credit facility through a credit agreement with its banking group 
this revolving credit facility has an accordion feature that allows for a maximum borrowing capacity of million and an expiration date of september  we believe this program will be adequate to provide necessary funding for our future cash requirements 
no commercial paper or borrowings on our revolving credit facility were outstanding at may  or cintas has certain covenants related to debt agreements 
these covenants limit our ability to incur certain liens  to engage in sale leaseback transactions and to merge  consolidate or sell all or substantially all of cintas assets 

table of contents these covenants also require cintas to maintain certain debt to capitalization and interest coverage ratios 
cross default provisions exist between certain debt instruments 
if a default of a significant covenant were to occur  the default could result in an acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness  impair liquidity and limit the ability to raise future capital 
as of may   cintas was in compliance with all significant debt covenants 
our access to the commercial paper and long term debt markets has historically provided us with sources of liquidity 
we do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining financing from those markets in the future in view of our favorable experiences in the debt markets in the recent past 
our ability to continue to access the commercial paper and long term debt markets on favorable interest rate and other terms will depend  to a significant degree  on the ratings assigned by the credit rating agencies to our indebtedness 
as of may   our ratings were as follows rating agency outlook commercial paper long term debt standard poor stable a bbb moody investors service stable p a in the event that the ratings of our commercial paper or our outstanding long term debt issues were substantially lowered or withdrawn for any reason  or if the ratings assigned to any new issue of long term debt securities were significantly lower than those noted above  particularly if we no longer had investment grade ratings  our ability to access the debt markets may be adversely affected 
in addition  in such a case  our cost of funds for new issues of commercial paper and long term debt would be higher than our cost of funds would have been had the ratings of those new issues been at or above the level of the ratings noted above 
the rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities 
each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
moreover  each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies 
to monitor our credit rating and our capacity for long term financing  we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors 
one such factor is the ratio of our total debt to capitalization 
for the purpose of this calculation  debt is defined as the sum of short term borrowings  long term debt due within one year  obligations under capital leases due in one year  long term debt and long term obligations under capital leases 
total capitalization is defined as debt plus shareholders equity 
at may  and may   the ratio of our total debt to capitalization was and  respectively 
we believe these levels are reasonable and allow for additional funding if the need arises

table of contents cintas also makes payments to defined contribution plans 
the amounts of contributions made to the defined contribution plans are made at the discretion of the board of directors of cintas 
future contributions are expected to increase approximately to annually 
based on that increase  payments due in one year or less would be million  two to three years would be million and four to five years would be million
