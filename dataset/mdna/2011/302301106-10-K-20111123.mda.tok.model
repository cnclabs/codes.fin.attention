critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities

stock compensation we account for stock compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of fasb asc compensation stock compensation 
the fair value of restricted shares is measured as the closing market price of our stock on the date of grant  which is amortized over the vesting period for each grant

fair value of financial instruments we have elected not to measure at fair value any eligible items for which fair value measurement is optional 
we determine the fair value of financial instruments by reference to various market data and other valuation techniques  as appropriate 
unless otherwise disclosed  the fair values of financial instruments approximate their recorded values  due primarily to their short term nature 
the recorded value of our outstanding debt is assumed to estimate its fair value  as it has no prepayment penalty and a floating interest rate based on market rates 
acquisitions we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc business combinations revised on october   and have applied it prospectively to all business acquisitions completed since that date 
in accordance with fasb asc  we allocate the total acquisition price to the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired and now immediately expense transaction costs that would have been included in the purchase price allocation under previous accounting standards

store operating income improved 
table of contents in dollars and in peso terms 
the increase in net revenues was mostly offset by higher costs from new stores that we expect will be a drag on earnings until they become profitable in their second year of operation 
approximately of the stores open at september  had been open less than a year 
we opened new stores in fiscal  of which are empe e su oro jewelry only pawn stores 
these jewelry only stores are much smaller and require less staff than our typical pawn stores  but also carry smaller average loan balances per store and immediately sell for scrap any forfeited loan collateral

same store pawn service charges increased approximately million  or  and new stores contributed million 
the same store increase was due to an improvement in the average pawn loan yield coupled with an increase in average loan balance during the period 
the yield increased primarily due to an increase in pawn service charge rates in certain geographic areas compared to fiscal  partially offset by a lower loan redemption rate

the gross profit on jewelry scrapping sales increased million to million 
the million increase in proceeds was mostly offset by a decrease in jewelry scrapping margins to  compared to in fiscal the significant volume increase and the margin decrease are due primarily to the introduction of our new empe e su oro jewelry only pawn stores

in august  we introduced installment loans in colorado as a replacement product for payday loans 
this contributed to the migration of some customers from payday loans to installment loans 
in fiscal  we opened stores in canada and closed one  bringing our total there to at september  we had two canadian stores 
during fiscal we closed ezmoney stores in the us  bringing our total to the segment s signature loan net revenues increased million  or  compared to fiscal the increase resulted primarily from the rapid growth in installment loans and a percentage point improvement in bad debt to of fees  net of the drag from new stores and closed or consolidated stores 
the improvement in bad debt was due to continuing improvements in the store level execution of servicing the customer and the loan  as well as enhanced productivity measurement tools and enhanced use of technology in our collections department 

table of contents the segment s net revenues from auto title loans increased to million in fiscal with bad debt at of related fees 
this loan product had little volume in fiscal we expect continued growth in the contribution from auto title loans as the product continues to mature 
the ezmoney segment began buying and scrapping gold jewelry in fiscal  generating million of gross profit  with a gross margin 
operations expense increased to million of net revenues from million of net revenues in the fiscal the increase was mostly from additional labor  rent and other costs at new stores net of closed stores

this increase was primarily due to an million increase in administrative labor and benefits  a million increase in professional fees and a million increase in stock compensation 
included in the increased labor and benefits is a higher accrual for incentive compensation reflective of the year s strong earnings performance and additional investments made in infrastructure to support our growth 
in the first fiscal quarter of fiscal administrative expense includes a million bonus to two executives upon their exercise of employee stock options granted in terms of the grants required us to pay a cash bonus to the two executives equal to the related tax savings realized by the company 
we do not expect this to recur  as no other outstanding options contain similar terms 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal depreciation on assets placed in service  primarily related to acquired pawn stores and new stores  was partially offset by assets that were retired or became fully depreciated during the year

in fiscal our equity in the net income of cash converters was million  accounted for on a month lag 
fiscal s income tax expense was million of pretax income compared to million of pretax income in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance established for the operating losses in our canada operations during their start up period in fiscal consolidated operating income for fiscal improved million  or  over fiscal to million

in fiscal  our million cash flow from operations consisted of i net income plus several non cash items  aggregating to million  and ii million of normal  recurring changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the primary differences in cash flow from operations between the current and prior years were the contribution from acquisitions and organic growth throughout our other operations and revenue streams  net of higher taxes paid 
the million of net cash used in investing activities during the current year was funded by cash flow from operations  cash on hand and borrowings on our line of credit facility

these amounts include principal  interest  insufficient funds fees and late fees 
in addition to the operating lease obligations in the table above  we are responsible for the maintenance  property taxes and insurance at most of our locations 
in the fiscal year ended september   these collectively amounted to million 
the operating lease obligations in the table above include expected rent for all our store locations through the end of their current lease terms 
of the us ezmoney financial services stores  adjoin an ezpawn store 
the lease agreements at approximately of the remaining free standing us ezmoney stores contain provisions that limit our exposure for additional rent to only a few months if laws were enacted that had a significant negative effect on our operations at these stores 
in fiscal  we plan to open approximately new stores for an aggregate investment of million of capital expenditures plus the funding of working capital and start up losses related to these store openings 
we believe new stores will create a drag on earnings and liquidity until their second year of operations 
on may   we entered into a new senior secured credit agreement with a syndication of five banks  replacing our previous credit agreement 
among other things  the new credit agreement provides for a four year million revolving credit facility that we may  under the terms of the agreement  request to be increased to a total of million 
upon entering the new credit agreement  we repaid and retired all other outstanding debt 
the new credit facility increases our available credit and provides greater flexibility to make investments and acquisitions both domestically and internationally 
terms of the credit agreement require  among other things  that we meet certain financial covenants 
we were in compliance with all covenants at september  and expect to remain in compliance based on our expected future performance 
at september   bank letters of credit totaling million were outstanding and we had borrowed million  leaving million available on the facility 
we anticipate that cash flow from operations  cash on hand and availability under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to fund our contractual obligations  planned store growth  capital expenditures and working capital requirements during the coming year 
we have an effective shelf registration statement on form s covering an aggregate of million shares of our class a common stock that we may offer from time to time in connection with future acquisitions of businesses  assets or securities 
during fiscal  we issued an aggregate of approximately  shares of class a common stock in connection with several acquisitions of pawn stores  leaving approximately million shares covered by the registration statement and available for issuance in future acquisitions as of september  off balance sheet arrangements we issue letters of credit locs to enhance the creditworthiness of our credit service customers seeking signature loans and auto title loans from unaffiliated lenders 
the locs assure the lenders that if borrowers default on the loans  we will pay the lenders  upon demand  the principal and accrued interest owed them by the borrowers 
table of contents plus any insufficient funds fee or late fee 
we do not record on our balance sheet the loans related to our credit services as the loans are made by unaffiliated lenders 
we do not consolidate the unaffiliated lenders results with our results as we do not have any ownership interest in the lenders  do not exercise control over them and do not otherwise meet the criteria for consolidation as prescribed by fasb asc regarding variable interest entities 
we include an allowance for expected loc losses in accounts payable and other accrued expenses on our balance sheet 
at september   the allowance for expected loc losses was million 
at that date  our maximum exposure for losses on letters of credit  if all brokered loans defaulted and none was collected  was million 
this amount includes principal  interest  insufficient funds fees and late fees 
we have no other off balance sheet arrangements 
seasonality historically  pawn service charges are highest in our fourth fiscal quarter july through september due to a higher average loan balance during the summer lending season 
merchandise sales are highest in the first and second fiscal quarters october through march due to the holiday season  jewelry sales surrounding valentine s day and the impact of tax refunds in the united states 
jewelry scrapping sales are heavily influenced by the timing of decisions to scrap excess jewelry inventory 
jewelry scrapping sales generally are greatest during our fourth fiscal quarter july through september 
this results from relatively low jewelry merchandise sales in that quarter and the higher loan balance  leading to a higher dollar amount of loan forfeitures in the summer lending season providing more inventory available for sale 
signature loan fees are generally highest in our third and fourth fiscal quarters april through september due to a higher average loan balance during the summer lending season 
signature loan bad debt  both in dollar terms and as a percentage of related fees  is highest in the third and fourth quarters and lowest in the second quarter due primarily to the impact of tax refunds 
the net effect of these factors is that net revenues and net income typically are strongest in the fourth fiscal quarter and weakest in the third fiscal quarter 
our cash flow typically is greatest in the second fiscal quarter due to a high level of loan redemptions and sales in the us income tax refund season
