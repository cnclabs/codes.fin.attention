equipment sales and software revenues increased and  respectively  compared to the prior year  however  these improvements were offset by a decline of in rental revenue  in financing revenue  in supplies revenue and in business services revenue compared to the prior year 
foreign currency translation and acquisitions had less than a favorable impact on revenue 
earnings before interest and taxes ebit increased in five of our segments when compared to the prior year primarily due to our ongoing productivity and cost reduction initiatives 
net income from continuing operations in was million  or per diluted share compared with million  or per diluted share in diluted earnings per share for was reduced by for restructuring charges and asset impairments  for non cash tax charges associated with out of the money stock options that expired during the year  for a one time charge to correct rates used to estimate unbilled international mail services revenue in prior periods and for recently enacted heath care legislation 
diluted earnings per share for was reduced by for restructuring charges  for non cash tax charges associated with out of the money stock options that expired during the year partially offset by a positive tax adjustment associated with the repricing of leveraged lease transactions 
we generated million in cash from operations  which was used to reduce debt by million  repurchase million of our common stock and pay million of dividends to our common stockholders 
for a more detailed discussion of our results of operations  see results of operations compared to and results of operations compared to outlook during the second half or  we began to see some positive signs in our business 
however  the worldwide economy and business environment continues to be uncertain  especially among small businesses 
this uncertain economic environment has impacted our financial results and in particular our recurring revenue streams  including our high margin financing  rental and supplies revenue streams 
recovery of these recurring revenue streams will lag a recovery in equipment sales 
while we have been successful in reducing our cost structure across the entire business and shifting to a more variable cost structure  these actions have not been sufficient to offset the impact of lower revenues 
we remain focused on streamlining our business operations and creating more flexibility in our cost structure 
we continue to expect our mix of revenue to change  with a greater percentage of revenue coming from enterprise related products and solutions 
we expect that our future results will continue to be impacted by changes in global economic conditions and their impact on mail intensive industries 
it is not expected that total mail volumes will rebound to prior peak levels in an economic recovery  and future mail volume trends will continue to be a factor for our businesses 
in  we announced we were undertaking a series of initiatives designed to transform and enhance the way we operate as a global company 
in order to enhance our responsiveness to changing market conditions  we have been executing on a strategic transformation program designed to create improved processes and systems to further enable us to invest in future growth in areas such as our global customer interactions and product development processes 
we expect the total pre tax cost of this program will be in the range of million to million primarily related to severance and benefit costs incurred in connection with workforce reductions 
currently  we are targeting annualized benefits  net of system and related investments  in the range of million to million on a pre tax basis  with a full benefit run rate by results of operations compared to business segment results we conduct our business activities in seven reporting segments within two business groups  small medium business solutions smb solutions and enterprise business solutions eb solutions 
the following table shows revenue and ebit in and by business segment 
ebit  a non gaap measure  is determined by deducting from segment revenue the related costs and expenses attributable to the segment 
ebit is useful to management in demonstrating the operational profitability of the segments by excluding interest and taxes  which are generally managed across the entire company on a consolidated basis  and general corporate expenses  restructuring charges and asset impairments 
ebit is also used for purposes of measuring the performance of our management team 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of segment amounts to income from continuing operations before income taxes 
revenue ebit change change us mailing international mailing smb solutions production mail software management services mail services marketing services eb solutions total small medium business solutions small medium business solutions revenue decreased to  million and ebit decreased to million  compared to the prior year 
within small medium business solutions us mailing revenue decreased to  million and ebit decreased to million  compared to the prior year 
the revenue decrease was driven primarily by lower financing  rental  service and supplies revenues 
the decrease in financing revenue is due to a decline in our leasing portfolio from reduced equipment sales in recent years 
rental  supplies and service revenues were lower than prior year due to fewer placements of new meters 
lease extensions have a positive impact on profit margins longer term but negatively impact equipment sales revenue in the current year 
equipment sales and supplies revenue were lower than prior year due to business consolidations  lease extensions and reduced volumes of mail processed 
revenue was also adversely affected by the ongoing changing mix to more fully featured smaller systems 
the lower ebit was due to the decline in higher margin financing  rental and supplies revenues 
international mailing revenue was flat at million compared to the prior year  including a favorable impact from foreign currency translation of 
while equipment sales were up slightly in certain parts of europe and canada  this increase was offset by continued declines in financing and rental revenues due to reduced equipment sales in recent years 
ebit increased to million compared to prior year  and was favorably impacted by an adjustment related to certain leveraged lease transactions in canada  our initiatives to improve productivity and consolidate functions globally and by from foreign currency translation 
enterprise business solutions enterprise business solutions revenue was flat at  million and ebit increased to million  compared to the prior year 
within enterprise business solutions production mail revenue increased over the prior year to million due to increased demand in the us for inserting equipment and our first installations of production print equipment 
demand for inserting equipment continued to experience a delayed recovery in certain countries outside of north america as many large enterprises in these regions continue to delay capital expenditures due to economic uncertainty 
ebit increased to million compared to last year due to the higher revenue and our initiatives to improve productivity and consolidate administrative functions 
foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on ebit 
software revenue increased over last year to million  driven by the acquisition of portrait software and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation 
we continue to build more recurring revenue streams through multi year licensing agreements  which have the effect of deferring some revenue to future periods 
ebit increased over last year to million due to business integration and productivity initiatives 
ebit was negatively impacted by transaction related fees of approximately million associated with the portrait acquisition 
foreign currency translation had a less than favorable impact on ebit 
management services revenue decreased compared to last year to million due to the loss of several large postal contracts and decreased print volumes 
despite the lower revenues  ebit increased over the prior year to million primarily due to our actions to align costs with changing volumes through a more variable cost infrastructure  ongoing productivity initiatives and a focus on more profitable contracts 
foreign currency translation had a less than impact on both revenue and ebit 
mail services revenue increased compared to last year to million  while ebit decreased to million 
mail services revenue and ebit were adversely impacted by million and million  respectively  due to a one time out of period adjustment in the international mail services portion of the business primarily related to the correction to the rates used to estimate earned but unbilled revenue for the periods through the first quarter of the impact of this adjustment was not material on any individual quarter or year during these periods 
excluding the impact of this adjustment  revenue increased over the prior year  but ebit decreased 
the revenue increase was driven partially by increased volumes of presort mail and standard class mail processed and acquisitions 
the decrease in ebit was driven by higher shipping rates charged by international carriers for our international mail services business  which more than offset the favorable margin impacts in our presort business 
marketing services revenue of million was flat compared to the prior year 
revenue was impacted by increased vendor advertising for movers source kits offset by a decline in household moves compared to prior year 
ebit increased over last year due to more profitable vendor revenue per transaction

see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
acquisitions on july   we acquired portrait software plc portrait for million in cash  net of cash acquired 
portrait provides software to enhance existing customer relationship management systems  enabling clients to achieve improved customer retention and profitability 
the acquired goodwill was assigned to the software segment 
we also completed smaller acquisitions during for an aggregate cost of million 
there were no acquisitions during in  we acquired zipsort  inc for million in cash  net of cash acquired

the operating results of these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for our business combination accounting policy and note for further information regarding these acquisitions 
liquidity and capital resources we believe that cash flow from operations  existing cash and liquid investments  as well as borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program  the existing credit facility and debt capital markets should be sufficient to finance our capital requirements and to cover our customer deposits 
our potential uses of cash include  but are not limited to  growth and expansion opportunities  internal investments  customer financing  severance and benefits payments under our restructuring programs  income tax  interest and dividend payments  pension and other benefit plan funding  acquisitions  and share repurchases 
we continuously review our liquidity profile 
we monitor for material changes in the creditworthiness of those banks acting as derivative counterparties  depository banks or credit providers to us through credit ratings and the credit default swap market 
we have determined that there has not been a material variation in the underlying sources of cash flows currently used to finance the operations of the company 
to date  we have had consistent access to the commercial paper market 
cash flow summary the change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash increase in cash and cash equivalents cash flows net cash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net income adjusted for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
cash provided by operating activities included decreases in finance receivables and accounts receivables of million and million  respectively 
due to declining equipment sales  finance receivables have declined as strong cash collections exceed the financing of new business 
similarly  accounts receivables have declined primarily due to strong cash collections in excess of new billings 
cash flow also benefited from the proceeds of million from the unwinding of interest rate swaps and by million due to the timing of payments of accounts payable  accrued liabilities and income taxes 
partially offsetting these benefits were restructuring payments of million and an increase in inventory of million 
net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of the net purchase of investment securities of million  capital expenditures of million and acquisitions of million 
net cash used in financing activities primarily included net payments on commercial paper borrowings of million  stock repurchases of million and dividends paid to common stockholders and noncontrolling interests of million 
cash flows cash flow provided by operations for is primarily due to the decrease in finance receivables and accounts receivables of million and million  respectively  primarily due to lower sales volumes  and an increase in current and non current income taxes of million due to the timing of tax payments 
these cash inflows were partially offset by a reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million  primarily due to timing of payments  voluntary pension plan contributions of million and restructuring payments of million 
net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of capital expenditures of million 
net cash used in financing activities consisted primarily of dividends paid to common stockholders and noncontrolling interests of million  a net reduction in debt of million  and a net cash outflow associated with the issuance and redemption of preferred stock issued by a subsidiary of million 
capital expenditures capital expenditures in and included additions to property  plant and equipment of million and million  respectively  and additions to rental equipment and related inventories of million and million  respectively 
the decrease in capital expenditures is due to lower new meter investments and control over capital spending 
financings and capitalization we are a well known seasoned issuer with the sec  which allows us to issue debt securities  preferred stock  preference stock  common stock  purchase contracts  depositary shares  warrants and units in an expedited fashion 
we have a commercial paper program that is a significant source of liquidity for us and a committed line of credit of billion which supports our commercial paper issuance 
the line of credit expires in we have not experienced any problems to date in accessing the commercial paper market 
as of december   the line of credit had not been drawn upon 
at december   we had million of outstanding commercial paper with a weighted average interest rate of 
during  borrowings under our commercial paper program averaged million at a weighted average interest rate of 
the maximum amount of commercial paper issued at any point in time during was million 
at december   we had million of outstanding commercial paper with a weighted average interest rate of 
during  borrowings under our commercial paper program averaged million at a weighted average interest rate of 
the maximum amount of commercial paper issued at any point in time during was million 
in august  we unwound two interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million 
these interest rate swaps effectively converted the fixed rate of on million of notes  due  into variable interest rates 
in connection with unwinding these interest rate swaps  we received million  excluding accrued interest 
the transaction was not undertaken for liquidity purposes  but rather to fix our effective interest rate at for the remaining term of the notes as the amount received will be recognized as a reduction in interest expense over the remaining term of the notes 
there were no other significant changes to long term debt during no long term notes will mature in we anticipate making contributions of approximately million and million to our us and foreign pension plans  respectively during we will reassess our funding alternatives as the year progresses 
we believe our financing needs in the short and long term can be met from cash generated internally  the issuance of commercial paper  debt issuance under our effective shelf registration statement and borrowing capacity under our existing credit agreements 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following summarizes our known contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements at december  and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period dollars in millions total less than year years years more than years commercial paper borrowings long term debt and current portion of long term debt non cancelable operating lease obligations interest payments on debt capital lease obligations purchase obligations other non current liabilities total purchase obligations include unrecorded agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding upon us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
other non current liabilities relate primarily to our postretirement benefits 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the amount and period of future payments related to our income tax uncertainties cannot be reliably estimated and  therefore  is not included in the above table 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
critical accounting estimates we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations 
we have discussed the impact and any associated risks on our results of operations related to these policies throughout the md a 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses that are reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying disclosures  including the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events  historical experience  actions that we may undertake in the future  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates include  but are not limited to  allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses  inventory obsolescence  residual values of leased assets  useful lives of long lived assets and intangible assets  impairment of goodwill  allocation of purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired in business combinations  warranty obligations  restructuring costs  pensions and other postretirement benefits and loss contingencies 
we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate in accordance with gaap  however  actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
revenue recognition multiple element and internal financing arrangements we derive our revenue from multiple sources including sales  rentals  financing and services 
certain of our transactions are consummated at the same time and can therefore generate revenue from multiple sources 
the most common form of these transactions involves a non cancelable equipment lease  a meter rental and an equipment maintenance agreement 
as a result  we are required to determine whether the deliverables in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if so  how the price should be allocated among the delivered elements and when to recognize revenue for each element 
in multiple element arrangements  we recognize revenue for each of the elements based on their respective fair values 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known and uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved 
our allocation of the fair values to the various elements does not change the total revenue recognized from a transaction  but impacts the timing of revenue recognition 
revenue is allocated to the meter rental and equipment maintenance agreement elements first using their respective fair values  which are determined based on prices charged in standalone and renewal transactions 
revenue is then allocated to the equipment based on the present value of the remaining minimum lease payments 
we then compare the allocated equipment fair value to the range of cash selling prices in standalone transactions during the period to ensure the allocated equipment fair value approximates average cash selling prices 
we provide lease financing for our products primarily through sales type leases 
the vast majority of our leases qualify as sales type leases using the present value of minimum lease payments classification criteria 
we believe that our sales type lease portfolio contains only normal collection risk 
accordingly  we record the fair value of equipment as sales revenue  the cost of equipment as cost of sales and the minimum lease payments plus the estimated residual value as finance receivables 
the difference between the finance receivable and the equipment fair value is recorded as unearned income and is amortized as income over the lease term using the interest method 
equipment residual values are determined at inception of the lease using estimates of equipment fair value at the end of the lease term 
estimates of future equipment fair value are based primarily on our historical experience 
we also consider forecasted supply and demand for our various products  product retirement and future product launch plans  end of lease customer behavior  regulatory changes  remanufacturing strategies  used equipment markets  if any  competition and technological changes 
we evaluate residual values on an annual basis or as changes to the above considerations occur 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for our accounting policies on revenue recognition 
allowances for doubtful accounts and credit losses allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate our accounts receivable risks and provide allowances for doubtful accounts accordingly 
we believe that our credit risk for accounts receivable is limited because of our large number of customers  small account balances for most of our customers and customer geographic and industry diversification 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical loss experience  length of time receivables are past due  adverse situations that may affect a customer s ability to pay and prevailing economic conditions  and make adjustments to our actual aggregate reserve as necessary 
this evaluation is inherently subjective and actual results may differ significantly from estimated reserves 
allowance for credit losses we estimate our finance receivables risks and provide allowances for credit losses accordingly 
we establish credit approval limits based on the credit quality of the customer and the type of equipment financed 
finance receivables are written off against the allowance for credit losses after collection efforts are exhausted and we deem the account uncollectible 
we believe that our concentration of credit risk for finance receivables is limited because of our large number of customers  small account balances and customer geographic and industry diversification 
our general policy is to discontinue revenue recognition for lease receivables when they are delinquent more than days  and to discontinue revenue recognition on unsecured loan receivables that are delinquent for more than days 
we resume revenue recognition when payments reduce the account to days or less past due 
we evaluate the adequacy of allowance for credit losses based on our historical loss experience  the nature and volume of our portfolios  adverse situations that may affect a customer s ability to pay and prevailing economic conditions  and make adjustments to our actual aggregate reserve as necessary 
this evaluation is inherently subjective and actual results may differ significantly from estimated reserves 
accounting for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
our annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we regularly assess the likelihood of tax adjustments in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and account for the related financial statement implications 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and possible adjustment 
we adjust these reserves  as well as the related interest  in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
we have established tax reserves which we believe to be appropriate given the possibility of tax adjustments 
determining the appropriate level of tax reserves requires us to exercise judgment regarding the uncertain application of tax law 
future changes in tax reserve requirements could have a material impact on our results of operations 
significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence for each jurisdiction including past operating results  estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies 
as new information becomes available that would alter our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that will ultimately be realized  we adjust the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made 
based on our income from continuing operations before income taxes  a change in our effective tax rate would impact income from continuing operations by approximately million 
goodwill and long lived assets useful lives of long lived assets we depreciate property  plant and equipment and rental property and equipment principally using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of three to years for machinery and equipment and up to years for buildings 
we amortize properties leased under capital leases on a straight line basis over the primary lease term 
we amortize capitalized costs related to internally developed software using the straight line method over the estimated useful life  which is principally three to ten years 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which are principally four to years  using the straight line method or an accelerated attrition method 
our estimates of useful lives could be affected by changes in regulatory provisions  technology or business plans 
impairment review we evaluate the recoverability and  if necessary  the fair value of our long lived assets  including intangible assets  on an annual basis or as circumstances warrant 
we derive the cash flow estimates that are incorporated into the analysis from our historical experience and our future long term business plans and  if necessary  apply an appropriate discount rate to assist in the determination of its fair value 
in addition  we used quoted market prices when available and appraisals as appropriate to assist in the determination of fair value 
changes in the estimates and assumptions incorporated in our long lived asset impairment assessment could materially affect the determination of fair value 
during  an asset impairment charge of million was recorded related to the impairment of certain intangible assets 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment  or sooner when circumstances indicate an impairment may exist at the reporting unit level 
our goodwill impairment review requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
we derive the cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our future long term business plans 
we use a combination of techniques to determine the fair value of our reporting units  including the present value of future cash flows  multiples of competitors and multiples from sales of like businesses 
changes in the estimates and assumptions incorporated in our goodwill impairment assessment could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
the calculated fair value of each of our reporting units was based on a combination of inputs and assumptions  including projections of future cash flows  discount rates  growth rates and applicable multiples of competitors and multiples from sales of like businesses 
for  the calculated fair values for all of our reporting units were considered substantially in excess of the respective reporting unit s carrying value 
accordingly  no goodwill impairment was identified or recorded 
however  future events and circumstances  some of which are described below  may result in an impairment charge future economic results that are below our expectations used in the current assessments  changes in postal regulations governing the types of meters allowable for use  new technological developments that provide significantly enhanced benefits over current technology  significant ongoing negative economic or industry trends  or changes in our business strategy that alters the expected usage of the related assets 
pension benefits assumptions and estimates the valuation and calculation of our net pension expense  assets and obligations are dependent on assumptions and estimates relating to discount rate  rate of compensation increase and expected return on plan assets 
these assumptions are evaluated and updated annually and are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the weighted average assumptions for our largest plan  the us qualified pension plan  and our largest foreign plan  the uk qualified pension plan  for and were as follows us plan uk plan discount rate rate of compensation increase expected return on plan assets us plan the discount rate for our us pension plans is determined by matching the expected cash flows associated with our benefit obligations to a yield curve based on long term  high quality fixed income debt instruments available as of the measurement date 
in  we reduced the population of bonds used to derive this yield curve with the adoption of a bond matching approach which incorporates a selection of bonds that align with our projected benefit obligations 
we believe this bond matching approach more closely reflects the process we would employ to settle our pension obligations 
the rate of compensation increase assumption reflects our actual experience and best estimate of future increases 
our expected return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the plans investment portfolio after analyzing historical experience and future expectations of the returns and volatility of the various asset classes 
the overall expected rate of return for the portfolio is determined based on the target asset allocations for each asset class  adjusted for historical and expected experience of active portfolio management results  when compared to the benchmark returns 
when assessing the expected future returns for the portfolio  we place more emphasis on the expected future returns than historical returns 
uk plan we determine our discount rate for the uk retirement benefit plan by using a model that discounts each year s estimated benefit payments by an applicable spot rate 
these spot rates are derived from a yield curve created from a large number of high quality corporate bonds 
the rate of compensation increase assumption reflects our actual experience and best estimate of future increases 
our expected return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results  the plan s asset mix and future expectations of market rates of return on the types of assets in the plan 
sensitivity to changes in assumptions us pension plan discount rate a increase in the discount rate would decrease annual pension expense by approximately million and would lower the projected benefit obligation by million 
rate of compensation increase a increase in the rate of compensation increase would increase annual pension expense by approximately million 
expected return on plan assets a increase in the expected return on assets of our principal plans would decrease annual pension expense by approximately million 
uk pension plan discount rate a increase in the discount rate would decrease annual pension expense by approximately million and would lower the projected benefit obligation by million 
rate of compensation increase a increase in the rate of compensation increase would increase annual pension expense by approximately million 
expected return on plan assets a increase in the expected return on assets of our principal plans would decrease annual pension expense by approximately million 
delayed recognition principles actual pension plan results that differ from our assumptions and estimates are accumulated and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants and will therefore affect future pension expense 
we also base our net pension expense primarily on a market related valuation of plan assets 
under this approach  differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets are recognized over a five year period and will also impact future pension expense 
investment related risks and uncertainties we invest our pension plan assets in a variety of investment securities in accordance with our strategic asset allocation policy 
the composition of our us pension plan assets at december  was approximately equity securities  fixed income securities and real estate and private equity investments 
the composition of our uk pension plan assets at december  was approximately equity securities  fixed income securities and cash 
investment securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate  market and credit risks 
in particular  due to the level of risk associated with investment securities  it is reasonably possible that change in the value of such investment securities will occur and that such changes could materially affect our future results 
new accounting pronouncements in  we adopted guidance that increases disclosures regarding the credit quality of an entity s financing receivables and its allowance for credit losses 
the guidance also requires an entity to disclose credit quality indicators  past due information  and modifications of its financing receivables 
the adoption of this guidance resulted in additional disclosures but did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in september  new guidance was introduced addressing the accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple elements and certain revenue arrangements that include software 
the guidance allows companies to allocate consideration in a multiple element arrangement in a way that better reflects the economics of the transaction and eliminates the residual method 
in addition  tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product will be scoped out of the software revenue guidance 
the new guidance will also result in more expansive disclosures 
the new guidance became effective on january  and is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
legal and regulatory matters legal see legal proceedings in item of this form k for information regarding our legal proceedings 
other regulatory matters we are continually under examination by tax authorities in the united states  other countries and local jurisdictions in which we have operations 
the years under examination vary by jurisdiction 
the current irs exam of tax years is estimated to be completed within the next year and the examination of years within the next two years 
in connection with the exam  we have received notices of proposed adjustments to our filed returns and the irs has withdrawn a civil summons to provide certain company workpapers 
tax reserves have been established which we believe to be appropriate given the possibility of tax adjustments 
a variety of post tax years remain subject to examination by other tax authorities  including the uk  canada  france  germany and various us states 
tax reserves have been established which we believe to be appropriate given the possibility of tax adjustments 
however  the resolution of such matters could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we are currently undergoing unclaimed property audits  which are being conducted by several states 
effects of inflation and foreign exchange inflation inflation  although minimal in recent years  continues to affect worldwide economies and the way companies operate 
it increases labor costs and operating expenses  and raises costs associated with replacement of fixed assets such as rental equipment 
despite these growing costs  we have generally been able to maintain profit margins through productivity and efficiency improvements  introduction of new products and expense reductions 
foreign exchange during  approximately of our revenue and of pre tax income from continuing operations were derived from operations outside of the us currency translation increased our revenue and pre tax income from continuing operations by less than 
based on the current contribution from our international operations  a increase in the value of the us dollar would result in a decline in revenue of approximately million and a decline in pre tax income from continuing operations of approximately million 
assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside the us are translated at rates in effect at the end of the period and revenue and expenses are translated at average monthly rates during the period 
net deferred translation gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders deficit in the consolidated balance sheets 
changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the currencies of countries in which we operate impact our reported assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
exchange rate fluctuations can also impact the settlement of intercompany receivables and payables from the transfer of finished goods inventories between our affiliates in different countries  and intercompany loans 
to mitigate the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  we enter into foreign exchange contracts 
these derivative contracts expose us to counterparty credit risk 
to mitigate this risk  we enter into contracts with only those financial institutions that meet stringent credit requirements as set forth in our derivative policy 
we regularly review our credit exposure balances as well as the creditworthiness of our counterparties 
maximum risk of loss on these contracts is limited to the amount of the difference between the spot rate at the date of the contract delivery and the contracted rate 
at december   the fair value of our outstanding foreign exchange contracts was a net liability of million 
during  deferred translation losses of million were recorded primarily resulting from the strengthening of the us dollar as compared to the british pound and euro  partially offset by a weakening of the us dollar as compared to the canadian dollar 
in  deferred translation gains of million were recorded as the us dollar weakened against the british pound  euro and canadian dollar 
deferred translation gains and losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and do not affect earnings 
dividends it is a general practice of our board of directors to pay a cash dividend on common stock each quarter 
in setting dividend payments  our board considers the dividend rate in relation to our recent and projected earnings and our capital investment opportunities and requirements 
we have paid a dividend each year since item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations due to our investing and funding activities and our operations denominated in different foreign currencies 
our objective in managing our exposure to changing interest rates is to limit the volatility and impact of changing interest rates on earnings and cash flows 
to achieve these objectives  we use a balanced mix of debt maturities and interest rate swaps that convert the fixed rate interest payments on certain debt issuances to variable rates 
our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility in earnings and cash flows associated with the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we enter into various contracts  which change in value as foreign exchange rates change  to protect the value of external and intercompany transactions 
the principal currencies actively hedged are the british pound  canadian dollar and euro 
we employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks 
we do not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures 
we utilize a value at risk var model to determine the potential loss in fair value from changes in market conditions 
the var model utilizes a variance co variance approach and assumes normal market conditions  a confidence level and a one day holding period 
the model includes all of our debt and all interest rate derivative contracts as well as our foreign exchange derivative contracts associated with forecasted transactions 
the model excludes anticipated transactions  firm commitments  and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by us  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 
during and  our maximum potential one day loss in fair value of our exposure to foreign exchange rates and interest rates  using the variance co variance technique described above  was not material
