overview tcc designs  manufactures  markets and sells communications security equipment that utilizes various methods of encryption to protect the information being transmitted 
encryption is a technique for rendering information unintelligible  which information can then be reconstituted if the recipient possesses the right decryption key 
the company manufactures several standard secure communications products and also provides custom designed  special purpose secure communications products for both domestic and international customers 
the company s products consist primarily of voice  data and facsimile encryptors 
revenue is generated principally from the sale of these products  which have traditionally been to foreign governments either through direct sale  pursuant to a us government contract or made as a sub contractor to domestic corporations under contract with the us government 
however  we have also sold these products to commercial entities and us government agencies 
we also generate revenues from contract engineering services performed for certain government agencies  both domestic and foreign  and commercial entities 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory reserves  receivable reserves  income taxes and stock based compensation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences may be material 
the accounting policies that management believes are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include those listed below 
for a more detailed discussion  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included herewith 

table of contents revenue recognition product revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  delivery of the product to the customer has occurred and we have determined that collection of the fee is probable 
title to the product generally passes upon shipment of the product  as the products are shipped fob shipping point  except for certain foreign shipments where title passes upon entry of the product into the first port in the buyer s country 
if the product requires installation to be performed by tcc  all revenue related to the product is deferred and recognized upon completion of the installation 
we provide for a warranty reserve at the time the product revenue is recognized 
we perform funded research and development and technology development for commercial companies and government agencies under both cost reimbursement and fixed price contracts 
cost reimbursement contracts provide for the reimbursement of allowable costs and  in some situations  the payment of a fee 
these contracts may contain incentive clauses providing for increases or decreases in the fee depending on how actual costs compare with a budget 
revenue from reimbursement contracts is recognized as services are performed 
on fixed price contracts that are expected to exceed one year in duration  revenue is recognized pursuant to the proportional performance method based upon the proportion of actual costs incurred to the total estimated costs for the contract 
in each type of contract  we receive periodic progress payments or payments upon reaching interim milestones  and we retain the rights to the intellectual property developed in government contracts 
all payments to tcc for work performed on contracts with agencies of the us government are subject to audit and adjustment by the defense contract audit agency 
adjustments are recognized in the period made 
when the current estimates of total contract revenue and contract costs for a product development contract indicate a loss  a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded 
any losses incurred in performing funded research and development projects are recognized as funded research and development expenses 
cost of product revenue includes material  labor and overhead 
costs incurred in connection with funded research and development are included in cost of sales 
inventory we value our inventory at the lower of actual cost  based on first in  first out basis fifo to purchase and or manufacture or the current estimated market value based on the estimated selling prices  less the cost to sell of the inventory 
we periodically review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and or obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand  as well as historical usage 
due to the custom and specific nature of certain of our products  demand and usage for products and materials can fluctuate significantly 
a significant decrease in demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases and an increase in excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence  any of which could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant negative impact on the value of our inventory and would reduce our reported operating results 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
the estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on a specific analysis of accounts in the receivable portfolio and historical write off experience 
while management believes the allowance to be adequate  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  which would reduce net income 
accounting for income taxes the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including those outside the united states  which may subject the company to certain risks that ordinarily would not be expected in the united states 
the income tax accounting process involves estimating our actual current exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 

table of contents significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of million as of september  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize these assets 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust our valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operation 
due to the nature of our current operations in foreign countries selling products into these countries with the assistance of local representatives  the company has not been subject to any foreign taxes in recent years 
also  it is not anticipated that we will be subject to foreign taxes in the near future 
stock based compensation we record the compensation expense for all share based payments based on the grant date fair value 
we expense share based compensation over the employee s requisite service period  generally the vesting period of the award 
the choice of a valuation technique  and the approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions for that technique  involve significant judgments 
these judgments reflect management s assessment of the most accurate method of valuing the stock options we issue  based on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information 
our judgments could change over time as additional information becomes available to us  or the facts underlying our assumptions change 
any change in our judgments could have a material effect on our financial statements 
we believe that our estimates incorporate all relevant information available at the time made and represent a reasonable approximation in light of the difficulties involved in valuing non traded stock options

domestic revenue may include the sale of products shipped through domestic resellers or manufacturers to international destinations 
the table below summarizes our principal foreign sales by country thailand bahrain saudi arabia france slovakia other revenue for fiscal was derived from the sale of the company s narrowband radio encryptors to a us radio manufacturer amounting to  and to an additional domestic customer amounting to  billings under programs for engineering services work amounting to  also were recognized during the period 
in addition  we made the final shipment under a contract with cecom amounting to  during fiscal we also sold our secure data link encryptors to a domestic customer amounting to  and we shipped our high speed bulk encryptors amounting to  under a contract with a domestic customer 

table of contents revenue for fiscal was derived from the sale of the company s narrowband radio encryptors to a us radio manufacturer amounting to  and to an additional domestic customer amounting to  billings under programs for engineering services work amounting to  also were recognized during the period 
in addition  we continued shipping products under the contract with cecom amounting to  during fiscal we also sold our secure telephone  fax  and data encryptors to a foreign customer amounting to  and we began shipping our high speed bulk encryptors amounting to  under a contract with a domestic customer gross profit gross profit for fiscal year was  a decrease of  or  compared to gross profit of  for fiscal year gross profit expressed as a percentage of sales was in fiscal year compared to in the prior year 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily associated with higher margin products being sold in fiscal operating costs and expenses selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were  compared to  for fiscal this increase of  was attributable to an increase in selling and marketing expenses of  offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses of  during the fiscal year 
the increase in selling and marketing costs during fiscal was attributable to an increase in product evaluation expenses of  and travel and outside consulting expenses of  and  respectively  and by an increase in personnel related costs of  these increases were partially offset by decreases in third party sales and marketing agreements of  outside sales commissions of  customer support expenses of  and bid and proposal activities of  the decrease in general and administrative costs during fiscal was primarily attributable to a decrease in professional fees of  and a decrease in bad debt expense of  which were partially offset by an increase in charitable contributions of  product development product development costs for fiscal were  compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel related costs of  and a decrease in billable engineering services work performed  which increased product development costs by approximately  these increases were offset by decreases in engineering support expenses of  outside consulting fees of  costs for materials and supplies of  and recruiting costs of the company actively sells its engineering services in support of funded research and development 
the receipt of these orders is sporadic  although such programs can span over several months 
in addition to these programs  the company invests in research and development to enhance its existing products or to develop new products  as it deems appropriate 
there was  of billable engineering services revenue generated during fiscal and  generated during fiscal it is anticipated that cash from operations will fund our near term research and development and marketing activities 
we also believe that  in the long term  based on current billable activities and the improvement in business prospects  cash from operations will be sufficient to meet the development goals of the company  although we can give no assurances 
any increase in activities either billable or new product related will require additional resources  which we may not be able to fund through cash from operations 
in circumstances where resources will be insufficient  the company will look to other sources of financing  including debt and or equity investments 

table of contents net income the company generated net income of  for fiscal year as compared to net income of  for fiscal year  a  decrease 
this decrease in net income is primarily attributable to a substantial decrease in gross profit on revenue from orders of our radio encryptors for deployment into afghanistan 
the effects of inflation and changing costs have not had a significant impact on sales or earnings in recent years 
as of september   none of the company s monetary assets or liabilities was subject to foreign exchange risks 
the company usually includes an inflation factor in its pricing when negotiating multi year contracts with customers 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents decreased by  or  to  as of september   from a balance of  at september  this decrease was primarily attributable to cash used in operations of  which included a decrease in accrued income taxes payable of  the payout of dividends of  and fixed asset additions of  during the period

the dividend is payable in cash on december  to all shareholders of record on december  it is not the company s intention to pay dividends on a regular basis unless future profits warrant such actions 
during fiscal  we received orders for our radio encryptors for use in afghanistan amounting to million  million of which was shipped in fiscal  and we continued shipments of our high speed encryptors to support a patriot missile upgrade program in taiwan from raytheon company amounting to million 
in addition  during the first fiscal quarter of we received orders for additional radio encryptors for use in afghanistan amounting to  and a new order from raytheon to continue its upgrade program of patriot missile systems in taiwan amounting to million 
it is anticipated that cash from operations will fund our near term research and development and marketing activities 
we also believe that  in the long term  based on current billable activities and the improvement in business prospects  cash from operations will be sufficient to meet the development goals of the company  although we can give no assurances 
any increase in activities either billable or new product related will require additional resources  which we may not be able to fund through cash from operations 
in circumstances where resources will be insufficient  the company will look to other sources of financing  including debt and or equity investments 
the company paid  during the fiscal year ended september  for income taxes related to fiscal year and  on current tax estimates of its income tax liability for fiscal year the company has recorded refundable income taxes of  as of september  the company s backlog as of september  is approximately million 
the orders in backlog are expected to ship during fiscal depending on customer requirements and product availability 
the company has a line of credit agreement with bank of america the bank for a line of credit not to exceed the principal amount of  the line is supported by a financing promissory note 
the loan is a demand loan with interest payable at the bank s prime rate plus on all outstanding balances 
the loan is secured by all assets of the company excluding consumer goods and requires the company to maintain its deposit accounts with the bank  as well as comply with certain other covenants 
the company believes this line of credit agreement provides it with an important external source of liquidity  if necessary 
there were no cash borrowings against the line during fiscal years and certain foreign customers require the company to guarantee bid bonds and performance of products sold 
these guaranties typically take the form of standby letters of credit 
guaranties are generally required in amounts of to of the purchase price and last in duration from three months to one year 
at september  and september  there were no outstanding standby letters of credit 
the company secures its outstanding standby letters of credit with the line of credit facility with the bank

our plan is to continue evaluating several technical options for enhancing the dsp radio encryption product line  which may include cryptography modifications  hardware and software changes and partnering with radio manufacturers to incorporate imbedded solutions 
in  tcc completed systems testing of a high speed  sonet sdh optical encryptor called the b  which provides full rate encryption capability at mbs and mbs speeds 
this encryptor is designed to be compliant with fips level and is expected to be offered in three configurations covering applications for commercial telecommunications providers through highly ruggedized military and government requirements 
tcc expects that the b encryptor family will provide fully interoperable operations between office and harsh field environments 
in  the company expects to field test the b and demonstrate the product to several potential customers 
on going research and development in support of product improvements and application variants also is expected to continue 
in tcc began development of an advanced  mbs through gbs family of ip encryptors which will service private network markets for government  military and satellite users 
this initiative is planned to have an initial product introduction in should the company choose to embark on a major development program in addition to its traditional research and development activities  engineering staff will have to be added 
the company has sufficient physical resources to support the added staff and believes that adequate technical resources exist in the boston area to meet potential needs  however we may need financial resources  in addition to cash from operations  to fund a major new development program 
other than those stated above  there are no plans for significant internal product development in fiscal and the company does not anticipate any significant capital expenditures during the year 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements
