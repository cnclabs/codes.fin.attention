item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview bioclinica provides integrated clinical research technology solutions to pharmaceutical  biotechnology  medical device companies and other organizations such as cros  engaged in global clinical studies 
our products and services include medical image management  electronic image transport and archive solutions  electronic data capture  clinical data management  interactive voice and web response  clinical trial supply forecasting tools  and clinical trial management software solutions 
by supplying enterprise class software and hosted solutions accompanied by expert services to fully utilize these tools  we believe that our offerings provide our clients  large and small  improved speed and efficiency in the execution of clinical studies  with reduced clinical and business risk 
market for our services our vision is to build critical mass in the complementary disciplines of clinical research related to data collection and processing especially those which can benefit from our information technology products and support services and to integrate them in ways that yield efficiency and value for our clients 
our goal is to provide demonstrable benefits to sponsor clients through this strategy  that is  faster and less expensive drug development 
we believe that the outsourcing of these services should continue to increase in the future because of increased pressure on clients  including factors such as the need to more tightly manage costs  capacity limitations  reductions in marketing exclusivity periods  the desire to reduce development time  increased globalization of clinical trials  productivity challenges  imminent patent expirations and more stringent regulation 
we believe these trends will continue to create opportunities for companies like bioclinica that are focused on improving the efficiency of drug and medical device development 
sales and backlog our sales cycle  referring to the period from the presentation by us to a potential client to the engagement of us by such client  has historically ranged from three to months 
in addition  the contracts under which we perform services typically cover a period of three to months and the volume and type of services performed by us generally vary during the course of a project 
we cannot assure you that our project revenues will be at levels sufficient to maintain profitability 
our contracted committed backlog  referred to as backlog  is the expected service revenue that remains to be earned and recognized on both signed and verbally agreed to contracts 
our backlog as of december  was million  compared to million at december  and million at december  changes in backlog for the period reflect the net effect of new contract signings  addendums  cancellations  expansions  and reductions in scope of existing projects  all of which impacted our backlog at december  contracts included in backlog are subject to termination by our clients at any time 
in the event that a contract is cancelled by the client  we would be entitled to receive payment for all services performed up to the cancellation date 
the duration of the projects included in our backlog range from less than three months to seven years 
we do not believe that backlog is a reliable predictor of future results because service revenues may be incurred in a given period on contracts that were not included in the previous reporting period s backlog and or contract cancellations or project delays may occur in a given period on contracts that were included in the previous reporting period s backlog 
acquisitions and dispositions on march   we acquired substantially all of the assets of privately held transenda international  llc  or transenda 
headquartered in bellevue  wa  transenda was a provider of ctms solutions 
transenda s suite of web based  office smart ctms solutions create efficiencies for trial operations through interoperability with microsoft office tools 
the ctms solutions enable our clients to have their applications work together instead of being locked into a single suite vendor and serves as the foundation for operational data interchange among different software applications 
this facilitates easier access to data with a consistent user interface and reduces training costs 
with this acquisition  we enhanced our ability to serve customers throughout the clinical research process with technologies that include improved efficiencies by reducing study durations and costs through integrated operational management 
the acquisition was made pursuant to an asset purchase agreement  dated march   by and between bioclinica and transenda  or the purchase agreement 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement  we purchased and acquired from transenda all right  title and interest of transenda in and to the purchased assets as defined in the purchase agreement and assumed the assumed liabilities as defined in the purchase agreement of transenda 
as consideration for the purchased assets and assumed liabilities  we paid  shares of common stock  par value per share  of the company  valued at a volume weighted average price per share equal to  and subject to a post closing adjustment based on the final closing net working capital as defined in the purchase agreement 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement  of the aggregate consideration is to be held in escrow to cover any potential indemnification claims under the purchase agreement for a period of months following the closing date as defined in the purchase agreement 
as part of the purchase agreement  transenda agreed not to directly or indirectly offer  sell  contract to sell  pledge  grant any option to purchase  make any short sale or otherwise dispose of any shares of bioclinica s common stock received pursuant to the purchase agreement for a period beginning on the date the purchase agreement was executed and continuing to and including the date months after such date 
we recorded the fair value of the acquisition of  based on our market value of on march   the date of acquisition 
on september   bioclinica acquired substantially all of the assets of tourtellotte solutions  inc  or tourtellotte 
tourtellotte provided software applications and consulting services which support clinical trials in the pharmaceutical industry 
the purchase price for tourtellotte was million in cash 
pursuant to the acquisition agreement  we agreed to pay up to an additional million in cash and  shares of our common stock based upon achieving certain milestones  which include certain product development and revenue targets  hereinafter referred to as the earn out 
in december  pursuant to obtaining certain milestones  we paid to the sellers of tourtellotte  million in cash and  shares of our common stock 
at december   the fair value of the remaining cash earn out of million has been recorded as a liability 
we used cash from operations to fund the cash purchase price for tourtellotte 
on august   bioclinica acquired the cardionow unit of agfa healthcare  or cardionow 
cardionow has developed a web based system for the secure transmission of medical cardiac images 
the software was specifically developed for and marketed to the invasive cardiology departments of hospitals within the united states 
bioclinica will integrate and enhance the current cardionow software and service to offer our clients a streamlined electronic transport solution to facilitate the blinding  sharing  tracking and archiving of medical images for multi center clinical trials as part of our suite of imaging services 
the purchase price for cardionow consisted of cash consideration paid to agfa healthcare of million 
we paid the purchase price for cardionow with cash from operations 
on january   pursuant to the asset purchase agreement by and among bioclinica and mbi benefits  inc  or mbi  an indirectly owned subsidiary of metavante technologies  inc  or metavante  dated as of january   we sold our capmed division  including the division s phr software and the patent pending personal healthkey technology  to metavante 
under the terms of the agreement  metavante paid us an upfront payment of  in cash and we were entitled to earn out payments based upon a percentage of the gross revenues recognized by metavante for contracts entered into with certain prospects set forth on a schedule during certain time periods in and we were entitled to receive of the gross revenues recognized by metavante during any period ending on or prior to december  from the sale pursuant to any contract mbi enters into with certain prospects during the first six months of additionally  we were entitled to receive of the gross revenues recognized by metavante during any period ending on or prior to december  from the sale pursuant to any contract mbi enters into with certain prospects during the period commencing on july  and ending on december  at december   we did not receive any earn out payments from metavante and due to the expiration of the earn out period we do not expect to receive any earn out payments in the future 
forward looking statements certain matters discussed in this form k are forward looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbors from liability established by the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements may be identified by  among other things  the use of forward looking terminology such as believes  expects  may  should or anticipates or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology  or by discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties 
in particular  our statements regarding our projected financial results  the demand for our services and technologies  growing recognition for the use of independent medical image review services  trends toward the outsourcing of imaging services in clinical trials  realized return from our marketing efforts  increased use of digital medical images in clinical trials  integration of our acquired companies and businesses  expansion into new business segments  the success of any potential acquisitions and the integration of current acquisitions  and the level of our backlog are examples of such forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements include risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the timing of revenues due to the variability in size  scope and duration of projects  estimates made by management with respect to our critical accounting policies  regulatory delays  clinical study results which lead to reductions or cancellations of projects and other factors  including general economic conditions and regulatory developments  not within our control 
the factors discussed in this form k and expressed from time to time in our filings with the sec could cause actual results and developments to be materially different from those expressed in or implied by such statements 
the forward looking statements are made only as of the date of this filing  and we undertake no obligation to publicly update such forward looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances 
critical accounting policies  estimates and risks our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
the most significant estimates relate to the recognition of revenue and profits based on the proportional performance method of accounting for fixed service contracts  accounting for acquisitions  capitalization of software development costs  income taxes and fair value accounting for stock based compensation 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue 
service revenues are recognized over the contractual term of our customer contracts using the proportional performance method 
service revenues are first recognized when we have a signed contract from a customer which i contain fixed or determinable fees  ii collectability of such fees is reasonably assured  and iii services are performed 
any change to recognized service revenue as a result of revisions to estimated total hours are recognized in the period the estimate changes 
we enter into service contracts that contain fixed or determinable fees 
the fees in the contracts are based on the scope of work we are contracted to perform  there are unitized fees per service and fixed fees with a total estimated for the contract based upon the estimated unitized service expected to be performed  as well as the service to be delivered under the fixed fee component of the contract 
the units are estimated based on the information provided by the customer  and we bill the customer for actual units completed in accordance with the terms of the contract 
in the event that a contract is cancelled by the client  we would be entitled to receive payment for all services performed up to the cancellation date 
we  at the request of our clients  directly contract with and pay independent radiologists  referred to as readers  who review the client s imaging data as part of the clinical trial 
the costs of the readers and other out of pocket expenses are reimbursed to us and recognized gross as reimbursement revenues 
we also enter into software license contracts that permit the customer to use our software products at its site 
generally  these contracts are multiple element arrangements since they usually provide for professional services and ongoing software maintenance 
in these instances  license fees are recognized upon the signing of the contract and delivery of the software if the license fee is fixed or determinable  collection is probable  and there is sufficient vendor specific evidence of the fair value of each undelivered element 
revenue for the software maintenance is recognized over the duration of the maintenance period 
when contracts include both professional services and software and require a significant amount of program modification or customization  installation  systems integration or related services  the professional services and license revenue is recorded based upon the estimated percentage of completion  measured in the manner described above 
changes in the estimated costs or hours to complete the contract and losses  if any  are reflected in the period during which the change or loss becomes known 
goodwill and other intangible assets  net 
goodwill is not amortized  instead  it is tested for impairment annually at december st or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flows  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  or slower growth rates  among others 
it is important to note that fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 
goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting level unit  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
bioclinica has one operating segment  clinical trial services  which is a single reporting unit 
we use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the current fair value of the reporting unit when testing for impairment  as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value 
a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the discounted cash flow model to forecast operating cash flows  including revenue growth rate  operating profit margins  discount rate  tax rates  capital spending  and working capital changes 
we consider market participant assumptions in estimating fair value of the reporting unit 
revenue growth rate and operating profit assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and long term financial planning process 
management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model  and actual results could differ from the estimates 
at december   we conducted the required annual test of impairment 
in  the estimated fair values of the clinical trial services reporting unit was in excess of its carrying values  resulting in no impairment 
capitalized software development 
we capitalize development costs for an internal use software project once the preliminary project stage is completed  we have committed to fund the project and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended 
we cease capitalization at such time as the computer software project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
the determination that a software project is eligible for capitalization and the ongoing assessment of recoverability of capitalized software development costs require considerable judgment by us with respect to certain external factors including  but not limited to  anticipated future revenue  estimated economic life and changes in software and hardware technologies 
software development costs related to products that will be sold  leased or marketed to be operated by customers on their equipment and premises are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of design and development costs of new products and significant enhancements to existing products incurred before the establishment of technological feasibility 
recoverable costs incurred subsequent to technological feasibility of new products and enhancements to existing products as well as costs associated with purchased software and software obtained through business acquisitions are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the related products  generally five to ten years average life is five years  using the straight line method or the ratio of current revenue to current and anticipated revenue from such software  whichever provides the greater amortization 
income taxes 
we evaluate the need to record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  we consider our future taxable income and on going prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the event that we were to determine that  in the future  we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be made  thereby increasing net income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged  thereby decreasing net income in the period such determination was made 
we recognize contingent liabilities for any tax related exposures when those exposures are more likely than not to occur 
stock based compensation costs 
we account for stock based compensation costs in accordance with fasb asc compensation stock compensation  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based payment awards made to our employees and directors 
under the fair value recognition of this guidance  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of the stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if the actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our stock based compensation cost  or if different assumptions had been used  we may have recorded too much or too little stock based compensation cost 
foreign currency risks our financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially increase the operating costs of our facilities in the netherlands and france  which are euro denominated 
a ten percent increase or decrease in the euro to us dollar spot exchange rate would result in a change of  and  to our net asset position  at december  and december   respectively 
in addition  certain of our contracts are denominated in foreign currency 
we believe that any adverse fluctuation in the foreign currency markets relating to these costs will not result in any material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in the event we derive a greater portion of our service revenues from international operations  factors associated with international operations  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  could affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our foreign currency financial assets and liabilities primarily consist of cash  trade receivables  prepaid expenses  fixed assets  trade payables and accrued expenses 
we were in a net asset position at december  and december  an increase in the exchange rate would result in less net assets when converted to us dollars 
conversely  if we were in a net liability position  a decrease in the exchange rate would result in more net liabilities when converted to us dollars 
we hedge our foreign currency exposure when and as appropriate to mitigate the adverse impact of fluctuating exchange rates 
as of december  and  there are no outstanding derivative positions

the results of operations of cardionow and tourtellotte are included in the consolidated statements of income for the period ended december  from the respective acquisition dates 
service revenues were million for fiscal and million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase in service revenues was due to an increase in work performed on the increased backlog from the prior year 
pfizer  inc  encompassing projects  represented of our service revenue for fiscal no one client accounted for more than of service revenues for fiscal reimbursement revenues and cost of reimbursement revenues was million for fiscal and million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
reimbursement revenues and cost of reimbursement revenues consist of payments received from the customer for reimbursable costs 
reimbursement revenues and cost of reimbursement revenues fluctuate significantly over the course of any given project  and quarter to quarter variations are a reflection of this project timing 
therefore  our management believes that reimbursement revenues and cost of reimbursement revenues are not a significant indicator of our overall performance trends 
at the request of our clients  we may directly pay the independent radiologists who review our client s imaging data 
in such cases  per contractual arrangement  these costs are billed to our clients and are included in reimbursement revenues and cost of reimbursement revenues 
cost of service revenues was million for fiscal and million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
cost of service revenues for fiscal and fiscal were comprised of professional salaries and benefits and allocated overhead 
the increase is due to additional personnel from the tourtellotte and transenda acquisitions 
the cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues also fluctuates due to work flow variations in the utilization of staff and the mix of services provided by us in any given period 
we expect that our cost of service revenues will increase in fiscal to service our newly released products 
sales and marketing expenses were million for fiscal and million for fiscal  an increase of  or 
sales and marketing expenses for fiscal and fiscal were comprised of direct sales and marketing costs  salaries and benefits and allocated overhead

general and administrative expenses for fiscal and fiscal consisted primarily of salaries and benefits  allocated overhead  professional and consulting services and corporate insurance 
the increase is due to the inclusion of costs from the acquisition of transenda and increased professional fees

amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions consisted primarily of amortization of customer backlog  customer relationships  software and non compete intangibles acquired from the acquisitions of pds  tourtellotte  transenda and theralys 
the increase is primarily due to the acquisition of tourtellotte and transenda 
we expect that the amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions will remain relatively flat in fiscal restructuring costs were for fiscal and  for fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  in order to streamline the operations and reduce costs  management decided to eliminate certain positions and consolidate redundant departments 
this resulted in restructuring charges of  consisting of  in employee severance and  in other close down costs 
we have paid the  in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal and nothing is left to be paid from the restructuring at december  we do not expect any additional costs from the fiscal restructuring plan 
merger and acquisition related costs were  for fiscal and  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
fiscal includes expenses of  resulting directly from merger and acquisition activities for the transenda acquisition such as legal  accounting and other due diligence and integration costs

net interest income is comprised of interest income earned on our cash balance and interest expense incurred on equipment lease obligations 
the decrease is due to lower average daily cash balances and lower interest rates earned on deposits

the consolidated statement of income for fiscal excludes the financial results of pds from the acquisition date of march  through march  due to immateriality of pds s results of operations for that period 
service revenues were million for fiscal and million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase in our service revenues was due to a full year of pds service revenue for fiscal versus only nine months of pds service revenue for fiscal offset by an overall decrease in service revenues for fiscal our service revenues have been impacted due to the pharmaceutical companies response to overall economic conditions  resulting in re evaluation of drug programs and some contract decisions being delayed 
we believe as worldwide demand for new drugs grow  our customers will continue to conduct more clinical trials in pursuit of regulatory approval in countries around the world and clinical trials service organizations  such as ours  with an established global presence  depth of services and expertise  will continue to benefit

also included in this cost is  of accretion related to the change in the fair value of earn out payments associated with the tourtellotte acquisition from the purchase price recorded at the date of acquisition to december  on january   we adopted fasb asc which requires acquisition related costs to be expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred and the services are received instead of including such costs as part of the acquisition price 
net interest income was  for fiscal and  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
net interest income and expense for fiscal and is comprised of interest income earned on our cash balance and interest expense incurred on equipment lease obligations 
the decrease was due to a decline in market interest rates for short term cash investments 
our income tax provision was million for fiscal and million for fiscal our effective tax rate from continuing operations was for fiscal and for fiscal the lower effective tax rate in fiscal was due to the mix of pre tax income in the us and in the netherlands  which has a lower corporate income tax rate than the us  and the changes affecting state tax rates

working capital  defined as current assets minus current liabilities  at december  was million as compared to working capital at december  of million 
net cash provided by continuing operating activities was million for fiscal compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal the primary drivers of the change in cash provided by continuing operations is the increase in accounts receivable and decrease in accounts payable 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal and million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to increased capitalized software development costs in fiscal net cash used in investing activities consists primarily of our investment in capitalized software development costs and property and equipment from continuing operations of million and cash paid for the acquisition earn out of tourtellotte of million 
we currently anticipate that capital expenditures for fiscal will be approximately million 
these expenditures primarily represent additional upgrades in our networking  data storage and data center infrastructure as well as capitalization of software costs 
net cash provided by financing activities was  for fiscal compared to net cash used in financing activities of  for fiscal net cash provided by used in financing activities is primarily attributable to a sale leaseback transaction of  and tax benefit related to stock options of  the following table lists our cash contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands less than contractual obligations total year years years more than years facility rent operating leases employment agreements earn outs for tourtellotte acquisition capital lease total contractual cash obligations on may   we entered into an unsecured  committed line of credit with pnc bank  expiring may  under the credit agreement  we have the ability to borrow million at interest rates equal to libor plus

we have neither paid nor declared dividends on our common stock since our inception and do not plan to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we have not entered into any off balance sheet transactions  arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources together with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next months 
however  we cannot assure you that our operating results will maintain profitability on an annual basis in the future 
the inherent operational risks associated with the following factors may have a material adverse affect on our future liquidity our ability to gain new client contracts  project cancellations  the variability of the timing of payments on existing client contracts  and other changes in our operating assets and liabilities 
we may seek to raise additional capital from equity or debt sources in order to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  such as more rapid expansion  acquisitions of complementary businesses or the development of new services 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available  if at all  on terms acceptable to us 
recently issued accounting statements in october  the fasb issued guidance on revenue recognition that will become effective for us beginning january  under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements  tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product will no longer be within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance  and software enabled products will now be subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance 
additionally  the fasb issued guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance 
under the new guidance  when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined  a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
the new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
management believes the adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu  business combinations asc topic disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
this amendment expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures required 
this amendment is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december   with earlier adoption permitted 
as the adoption of asu only requires enhanced disclosures  this standard will have no impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we invest in high quality financial instruments  comprised of savings accounts  certificate of deposits and money market funds 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we do not believe that we have any material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
foreign currency risk in accordance with our foreign exchange rate risk management policy  we had purchased monthly euro call options in prior years 
these options were intended to hedge against the exposure to variability in our cash flows resulting from the euro denominated costs for our netherlands and france subsidiaries 
during the months ended december  and  we have not purchased any euro call options  because our foreign currency needs are generally being met by the cash flow generated by euro denominated contracts 
as of december   there were no outstanding derivative positions 
under our current foreign exchange rate risk management policy  and upon expiration or ineffectiveness of any derivatives  we will record a gain or loss from such derivatives that are deferred in stockholders equity to cost of revenues and general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of income based on the nature of the underlying cash flow hedged
