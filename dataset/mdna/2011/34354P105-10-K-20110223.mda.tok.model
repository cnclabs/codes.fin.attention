item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report 

table of contents employee focus we focus on several elements in our strategic efforts to continuously enhance our organizational capability  including institutionalizing our succession planning along with our leadership competencies and performance management capabilities  with a focus on key positions and critical talent pools  utilizing these capabilities to drive employee engagement through our training initiatives and leadership development programs and facilitate our cross divisional and functional development assignments  developing talent acquisition programs such as our engineering recruitment program to address critical talent needs to support our emerging markets and global growth  capturing the intellectual capital in the current workforce  disseminating it throughout our company and sharing it with customers as a competitive advantage  creating a total compensation program that provides our associates with equitable opportunities that are competitive and linked to business and individual performance while promoting employee behavior consistent with our code of business conduct and risk tolerance  and building a diverse and globally inclusive organization with a strong ethical and compliance culture based on transparency and trust 
we continue to focus on training through the distribution of electronic learning packages in multiple languages for our code of business conduct  workplace harassment  facility safety  anti bribery  export compliance and other regulatory and compliance programs 
we continue to drive our training and leadership development programs through the deployment of general management development  manager competencies and a series of multi lingual course in a box programs that focus on enhancing people management skills 
sustainable business model the sustainable business model initiative is focused on all of the areas that have the potential of adversely affecting our reputation  limiting our financial flexibility or creating unnecessary risk for any of our stakeholders 
we proactively manage an enterprise risk management program with regular reviews of high level matters with our board of directors 
we work with our capital sourcing partners to ensure that our credit facilities and terms are appropriately aligned with our business strategy 
we also train our associates on and monitor all matters of a legal or ethical nature to support understanding and compliance on a global basis 
competition despite consolidation activities in past years  the markets for our products remain highly competitive  with primary competitive drivers being price  reputation  timeliness of delivery  quality  proximity to service centers and technical expertise  as well as contractual terms and previous installation history 
in the pursuit of large capital projects  competitive drivers and competition vary depending on the industry and products involved 
industries experiencing slow growth generally tend to have a competitive environment more heavily influenced by price due to supply outweighing demand  and price competition tends to be more significant for original equipment orders than aftermarket services 
considering the domestic and global economic environments in and current forecasts for  pricing was and may continue to be a particularly influential competitive factor 
the unique competitive environments in each of our three business segments are discussed in more detail under the business segments heading below 
in the aftermarket portion of our business  we compete against large and well established national and global competitors and  in some markets  against regional and local companies who produce low cost replications of spare parts 
in the oil and gas industry  the primary competitors for aftermarket services tend to be customers own in house capabilities 
in the nuclear power generation industry  we possess certain competitive advantages due to our n stamp certification  which is a prerequisite to serve customers in that industry  and our considerable base of proprietary knowledge 
in other industries  the competitors for aftermarket services tend to be local independent 
table of contents repair shops and low cost replicators 
aftermarket competition for standardized products is aggressive due to the existence of common standards allowing for easier replacement or repair of the installed products 
in the sale of aftermarket products and services  we benefit from our large installed base of pumps  valves and seals  which continually require maintenance  repair and replacement parts due to the nature of the products and the conditions under which they operate 
timeliness of delivery  quality and the proximity of service centers are important customer considerations when selecting a provider for aftermarket products and services 
in geographic regions where we are locally positioned to provide a quick response  customers have traditionally relied on us  rather than our competitors  for aftermarket products relating to our highly engineered and customized products  although we are seeing increased competition in this area 
generally  our customers attempt to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase  thereby reducing the size and diversity of their inventory 
although vendor reduction programs could adversely affect our business  we have been successful in establishing long term supply agreements with a number of customers 
while the majority of these agreements do not provide us with exclusive rights  they can provide us a preferred status with our customers and thereby increase opportunities to win future business 
we also utilize our lifecycle advantage program to establish fee based contracts to manage customers aftermarket requirements 
these programs provide an opportunity to manage the customer s installed base and expand the business relationship with the customer 
our ability to use our portfolio of products  solutions and services to meet customer needs is a competitive strength 
our market approach is to create value for our customers throughout the life cycle of their investments in flow control management 
we continue to explore and develop potential new offerings in conjunction with our customers 
in the early phases of project design  we endeavor to create value in optimizing the selection of equipment for the customer s specific application  as we are capable of providing technical expertise on product and system capabilities even outside the scope of our specific products  solutions and services 
after the equipment is constructed and delivered to the customer s site  we continue to create value through our aftermarket capabilities by optimizing the performance of the equipment over its operational life 
our skilled service personnel can provide these aftermarket services for our products  as well as many competitors products  within the installed base 
this value is further enhanced by the global reach of our qrcs and  when combined with our other solutions for our customers flow control management needs  allows us to create value for our customers during all phases of the capital expenditure cycle 
new product development we spent million  million and million during  and  respectively  on r d initiatives 
our r d group consists of engineers involved in new product development and improvement of existing products 
additionally  we sponsor consortium programs for research with various universities and jointly conduct limited development work with certain vendors  licensees and customers 
we believe current expenditures are adequate to sustain our ongoing and necessary future r d activities 
in addition  we work closely with our customers on customer sponsored research activities to help execute their r d initiatives in connection with our products and services 
new product development in each of our three business segments is discussed in more detail under the business segments heading below 
customers we sell to a wide variety of customers globally in several distinct industries oil and gas  chemical  power generation  water management  and a number of other industries that are collectively referred to as general industries 
no individual customer accounted for more than of our consolidated revenues 
customer information relating to each of our three business segments is discussed in more detail under the business segments heading below 
we are not normally required to carry unusually high amounts of inventory to meet customer delivery requirements  although higher backlog levels and longer lead times generally require higher amounts of inventory 
we have been working to increase our overall inventory efficiency to improve our operational effectiveness and reduce working capital needs 
while we do provide cancellation policies through our contractual relationships  we generally do not provide rights of product return for our customers 

table of contents selling and distribution we primarily distribute our products through direct sales by employees assigned to specific regions  industries or products 
in addition  we use distributors and sales representatives to supplement our direct sales force in countries where it is more appropriate due to business practices or customs  or whenever the use of direct sales staff is not economically efficient 
we generate a majority of our sales leads through existing relationships with vendors  customers and prospects or through referrals 
intellectual property we own a number of trademarks and patents relating to the names and designs of our products 
we consider our trademarks and patents to be valuable assets of our business 
in addition  our pool of proprietary information  consisting of know how and trade secrets related to the design  manufacture and operation of our products  is considered particularly valuable 
accordingly  we take proactive measures to protect such proprietary information 
we generally own the rights to the products that we manufacture and sell and are unencumbered by licensing or franchise agreements 
our trademarks can typically be renewed indefinitely as long as they remain in use  whereas our existing patents generally expire years from the dates they were filed  which has occurred at various times in the past 
we do not believe that the expiration of any individual patent will have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition or result of operations 
raw materials the principal raw materials used in manufacturing our products are readily available and include ferrous and non ferrous metals in the form of bar stock  machined castings  fasteners  forgings and motors  as well as silicon  carbon faces  gaskets and fluoropolymer components

we believe relations with our employees throughout our operations are generally satisfactory  including those employees represented by unions and employee works councils 
no unionized facility accounts for more than of our revenues 
environmental regulations and proceedings we are subject to environmental laws and regulations in all jurisdictions in which we have operating facilities 
these requirements primarily relate to the generation and disposal of wastes  air emissions and waste water 
table of contents discharges 
we periodically make capital expenditures to enhance our compliance with environmental requirements  as well as to abate and control pollution 
at present  we have no plans for any material capital expenditures for environmental control equipment at any of our facilities 
however  we have incurred and continue to incur operating costs relating to ongoing environmental compliance matters 
based on existing and proposed environmental requirements and our anticipated production schedule  we believe that future environmental compliance expenditures will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we use hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes in many of our manufacturing and foundry operations 
most of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes and some may require clean up of historical contamination 
during the due diligence phase of our acquisitions  we conduct environmental site assessments to identify potential environmental liabilities and required clean up measures 
we are currently conducting follow up investigation and or remediation activities at those locations where we have known environmental concerns 
we have cleaned up a majority of the sites with known historical contamination and are addressing the remaining identified issues 
over the years  we have been involved as one of many potentially responsible parties prp at former public waste disposal sites that are or were subject to investigation and remediation 
we are currently involved as a prp at four superfund sites 
the sites are in various stages of evaluation by government authorities 
our total projected fair share cost allocation at these four sites is expected to be immaterial 
see item legal proceedings included in this annual report for more information 
we have established reserves that we currently believe to be adequate to cover our currently identified on site and off site environmental liabilities 
exports our export sales from the us to foreign unaffiliated customers were million in  million in and million in licenses are required from us and other government agencies to export certain products 
in particular  products with nuclear power generation and or military applications are restricted  as are certain other pump  valve and mechanical seal products

risk factors any of the events discussed as risk factors below may occur 
if they do  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
additional risks and uncertainties not 
table of contents presently known to us  or that we currently deem immaterial  may also impair our business operations 
because of these risk factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance  and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
our business depends on the levels of capital investment and maintenance expenditures by our customers  which in turn are affected by numerous factors  including the state of domestic and global economies  global energy demand  the cyclical nature of their markets  their liquidity and the condition of global credit and capital markets 
demand for most of our products and services depends on the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures by our customers 
the level of capital expenditures by our customers depends  in turn  on general economic conditions  availability of credit  economic conditions within their respective industries and expectations of future market behavior 
additionally  volatility in commodity prices can negatively affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders 
the ability of our customers to finance capital investment and maintenance may also be affected by factors independent of the conditions in their industry  such as the condition of global credit and capital markets 
the businesses of many of our customers  particularly oil and gas companies  chemical companies and general industrial companies  are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns 
our customers in these industries  particularly those whose demand for our products and services is primarily profit driven  historically have tended to delay large capital projects  including expensive maintenance and upgrades  during economic downturns 
for example  our chemical customers generally tend to reduce their spending on capital investments and operate their facilities at lower levels in a soft economic environment  which reduces demand for our products and services 
additionally  fluctuating energy demand forecasts and lingering uncertainty concerning commodity pricing can cause our customers to be more conservative in their capital planning  which may reduce demand for our products and services 
reduced demand for our products and services could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess manufacturing capacity  which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs 
this reduced demand may also erode average selling prices in our industry 
any of these results could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
additionally  some of our customers may delay capital investment and maintenance even during favorable conditions in their markets 
lingering effects of global financial markets and banking systems disruptions experienced in and continue to make credit and capital markets difficult for some companies to access  and the costs of newly raised debt for most companies have generally increased 
any difficulty in accessing these markets and the increased associated costs can have a negative effect on investment in large capital projects  including necessary maintenance and upgrades  even during favorable market conditions 
in addition  the liquidity and financial position of our customers could impact their ability to pay in full and or on a timely basis 
any of these factors  whether individually or in the aggregate  could have a material adverse effect on our customers and  in turn  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
volatility in commodity prices  effects from credit and capital market disruptions and a sluggish global economic recovery could prompt customers to delay or cancel existing orders  which could adversely affect the viability of our backlog and could impede our ability to realize revenues on our backlog 
our backlog represents the value of uncompleted customer orders 
while we cannot be certain that reported backlog will be indicative of future results  our ability to accurately value our backlog can be adversely affected by numerous factors  including the health of our customers businesses and their access to capital  volatility in commodity prices and economic uncertainty 
while we attempt to mitigate the financial consequences of order delays and cancellations through contractual provisions and other means  if we were to experience a significant increase in order delays or cancellations that can result from the aforementioned economic conditions  it could impede or delay our ability to realize anticipated revenues on our backlog 
such a loss of anticipated revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents we may be unable to deliver our sizeable backlog on time  which could affect our revenues  future sales and profitability and our relationships with customers

in  our ability to meet customer delivery schedules for backlog is dependent on a number of factors including  but not limited to  sufficient manufacturing plant capacity  adequate supply channel access to the raw materials and other inventory required for production  an adequately trained and capable workforce  project engineering expertise for certain large projects and appropriate planning and scheduling of manufacturing resources 
many of the contracts we enter into with our customers require long manufacturing lead times and contain penalty clauses related to on time delivery 
failure to deliver in accordance with customer expectations could subject us to financial penalties  may result in damage to existing customer relationships and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we sell our products in highly competitive markets  which results in pressure on our profit margins and limits our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our products 
the markets for our products and services are geographically diverse and highly competitive 
we compete against large and well established national and global companies  as well as regional and local companies  low cost replicators of spare parts and in house maintenance departments of our end user customers 
we compete based on price  technical expertise  timeliness of delivery  contractual terms  previous installation history and reputation for quality and reliability 
competitive environments in slow growth industries and for original equipment orders have been inherently more influenced by pricing and domestic and global economic conditions during  and current economic forecasts suggest that the competitive influence of pricing has broadened 
additionally  some of our customers have been attempting to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase in order to reduce the size and diversity of their inventory 
to remain competitive  we must invest in manufacturing  marketing  customer service and support and our distribution networks 
no assurances can be made that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make the investment required to maintain or increase our market share or that our investments will be successful 
if we do not compete successfully  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
if we are unable to obtain raw materials at favorable prices  our operating margins and results of operations may be adversely affected 
we purchase substantially all electric power and other raw materials we use in the manufacturing of our products from outside sources 
the costs of these raw materials have been volatile historically and are influenced by factors that are outside our control 
in recent years  the prices for energy  metal alloys  nickel and certain other of our raw materials have been volatile 
while we strive to offset our increased costs through supply chain management  contractual provisions and our cip initiative  where gains are achieved in operational efficiencies  our operating margins and results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected if we are unable to pass increases in the costs of our raw materials on to our customers or operational efficiencies are not achieved 
if we are not able to execute and realize the expected financial benefits from our strategic realignment and other cost saving initiatives  our business could be adversely affected 
at the outset of  we announced a strategic realignment initiative intended to reduce and optimize certain non strategic manufacturing facilities and our overall cost structure 
this initiative was expanded in the latter half of to include additional realignment activities in the remainder of and continuing to a lesser extent into and this initiative involved structural changes in our global manufacturing footprint through additional migration to low cost regions  additional consolidation of product manufacturing and further selling  general and administrative expense sg a reductions 
we also announced as part of our larger realignment strategy and to better serve our customers that  effective january   we consolidated the former flowserve pump division and former flow solutions division into the flow solutions group 
while we anticipate significant financial benefits from our strategic realignment  anticipated cost savings are by their nature estimates that are difficult to predict and are necessarily inexact 
further  integration and realignment 
table of contents activities can place substantial demands on management  which could divert attention from other business priorities 
while our activities concerning these initiatives are substantially complete  the lingering adverse effects from our integration and our execution of realignment activities could interfere with our realization of anticipated synergies  customer service improvements and cost savings from these strategic initiatives 
this failure could  in turn  materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
economic  political and other risks associated with international operations could adversely affect our business 
a substantial portion of our operations is conducted and located outside the us we have manufacturing  sales or service facilities in more than countries and sell to customers in over countries  in addition to the us moreover  we primarily outsource certain of our manufacturing and engineering functions to  and source our raw materials and components from  china  eastern europe  india  latin america and mexico 
accordingly  our business and results of operations are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally  including instability in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  particularly in emerging markets and the middle east  trade protection measures  such as tariff increases  and import and export licensing and control requirements  potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws or tax examinations  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through some foreign legal systems  differing and  in some cases  more stringent labor regulations  partial or total expropriation  differing protection of intellectual property  inability to repatriate income or capital  and difficulty in administering and enforcing corporate policies  which may be different than the customary business practices of local cultures 
for example  political unrest or work stoppages could negatively impact the demand for our products from customers in affected countries and other customers  such as us oil refineries  that could be affected by the resulting disruption in the supply of crude oil 
similarly  military conflicts in the middle east could soften the level of capital investment and demand for our products and services 
we are also investigating or have investigated certain allegations regarding foreign management engaging in unethical practices prohibited by our code of business conduct  which could have inappropriately benefited them at our expense 
in order to manage our day to day operations  we must overcome cultural and language barriers and assimilate different business practices 
in addition  we are required to create compensation programs  employment policies and other administrative programs that comply with laws of multiple countries 
we also must communicate and monitor standards and directives across our global network 
our failure to successfully manage our geographically diverse operations could impair our ability to react quickly to changing business and market conditions and to enforce compliance with standards and procedures 
our future success will depend  in large part  on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations 
any of these factors could  however  materially adversely affect our international operations and  consequently  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our international operations and foreign subsidiaries are subject to a variety of complex and continually changing laws and regulations 
due to the international scope of our operations  the system of laws and regulations to which we are subject is complex and includes  without limitation  regulations issued by the us customs and border protection  the 
table of contents us department of commerce s bureau of industry and security  the us treasury department s office of foreign assets control and various foreign governmental agencies  including applicable export controls  customs  currency exchange control and transfer pricing regulations  as applicable 
no assurances can be made that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with  or be able to detect violations of  any such laws or regulations 
in addition  we cannot predict the nature  scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 
we are also subject to risks associated with certain of our foreign subsidiaries autonomously making sales and providing related services  under their own local authority  to customers in countries that have been designated by the us state department as state sponsors of terrorism  including iran  syria and sudan 
due to the growing political uncertainties associated with these countries  in  our foreign subsidiaries began a voluntary withdrawal  on a phased basis  from conducting new business in these countries 
the aggregate amount of all business done by our foreign subsidiaries for customers in iran  syria and sudan accounted for less than of our consolidated global revenue in while substantially all new business with these countries has been voluntarily phased out  our foreign subsidiaries may independently continue to honor certain existing contracts  commitments and warranty obligations in compliance with us and other applicable laws and regulations 
our international operations expose us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
a significant portion of our revenue and certain of our costs  assets and liabilities  are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the primary currencies to which we have exposure are the euro  british pound  mexican peso  brazilian real  indian rupee  japanese yen  singapore dollar  argentine peso  canadian dollar  chinese yuan  colombian peso  chilean peso and south african rand 
certain of the foreign currencies to which we have exposure  such as the argentinean peso and the venezuelan bolivar  have undergone significant devaluation in the past  which can reduce the value of our local monetary assets  reduce the us dollar value of our local cash flow  generate local currency losses that may impact our ability to pay future dividends from our subsidiary to the parent company and potentially reduce the us dollar value of future local net income 
although we enter into forward exchange contracts to economically hedge some of our risks associated with transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies  no assurances can be made that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide anti bribery laws and regulations 
the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and similar anti bribery laws and regulations in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non us government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing an improper business advantage 
our policies mandate compliance with these anti bribery laws 
we operate in many parts of the world and sell to industries that have experienced corruption to some degree 
if we are found to be liable for fcpa or other similar anti bribery law or regulatory violations  whether due to our or others actions or inadvertence  we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions that could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
noncompliance with us export control laws could materially adversely affect our business 
in march  we initiated a voluntary process to determine our compliance posture with respect to us export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations 
upon initial investigation  it appeared that some product transactions and technology transfers were not handled in full compliance with us export control laws and regulations 
as a result  in conjunction with outside counsel  we conducted a voluntary systematic process to further review  validate and voluntarily disclose export violations discovered as part of this review process 
we completed our comprehensive disclosures to the appropriate us government regulatory authorities at the end of  and we continue to work with those authorities to supplement and clarify specific aspects of those disclosures 
based on our review of the data collected  during the self disclosure period of october  through october   a number of process pumps  valves  mechanical seals and parts related thereto were exported  in limited 
table of contents circumstances  without required export or reexport licenses or without full compliance with all applicable rules and regulations to a number of different countries throughout the world  including certain us sanctioned countries 
any self reported violations of us export control laws and regulations may result in civil or criminal penalties  including fines and or other penalties 
we are currently engaged in discussions with us regulators about such penalties as part of our effort to resolve this matter  however  we currently do not believe any such penalties will have a material adverse impact on our company 
terrorist acts  conflicts and wars may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations and may adversely affect the market for our common stock 
as a major multi national company with a large international footprint  we are subject to increased risk of damage or disruption to us  our employees  facilities  partners  suppliers  distributors  resellers or customers due to terrorist acts  conflicts and wars  wherever located around the world 
the potential for future attacks  the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security  and other actual or potential conflicts or wars  including the israeli hamas conflict and ongoing military operations in the middle east at large  have created many economic and political uncertainties 
in addition  as a major multi national company with headquarters and significant operations located in the us  actions against or by the us may impact our business or employees 
although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events  they could result in a decrease in demand for our products  make it difficult or impossible to deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers  create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and pose risks to our employees  resulting in the need to impose travel restrictions  any of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
environmental compliance costs and liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our operations and properties are subject to regulation under environmental laws  which can impose substantial sanctions for violations 
we must conform our operations to applicable regulatory requirements and adapt to changes in such requirements in all countries in which we operate 
we use hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes in many of our manufacturing and foundry operations 
most of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes  and some may require clean up of historical contamination 
we are currently conducting investigation and or remediation activities at a number of locations where we have known environmental concerns 
in addition  we have been identified as one of many prps at four superfund sites 
the projected cost of remediation at these sites  as well as our alleged fair share allocation  while not anticipated to be material  has been reserved 
however  until all studies have been completed and the parties have either negotiated an amicable resolution or the matter has been judicially resolved  some degree of uncertainty remains 
we have incurred  and expect to continue to incur  operating and capital costs to comply with environmental requirements 
in addition  new laws and regulations  stricter enforcement of existing requirements  the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities 
moreover  environmental and sustainability initiatives  practices  rules and regulations are under increasing scrutiny of both governmental and non governmental bodies  which can cause rapid change in operational practices  standards and expectations and  in turn  increase our compliance costs 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we are party to asbestos containing product litigation that could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we are a defendant in a substantial number of lawsuits that seek to recover damages for personal injury allegedly resulting from exposure to asbestos containing products formerly manufactured and or distributed by us 
such products were used as internal components of process equipment  and we do not believe that there was any significant emission of asbestos containing fibers during the use of this equipment 
although we are defending 
table of contents these allegations vigorously and believe that a high percentage of these lawsuits are covered by insurance or indemnities from other companies  there can be no assurance that we will prevail or that payments made by insurance or such other companies would be adequate 
unfavorable rulings  judgments or settlement terms could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our business may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters 
as of december   we had approximately  employees  of which approximately  were located in the us approximately of our us employees are represented by unions 
we also have unionized employees or employee work councils in argentina  australia  austria  brazil  canada  finland  france  germany  italy  japan  mexico  the netherlands  poland  spain  sweden and the united kingdom 
no unionized facility produces more than of our revenues 
although we believe that our relations with our employees are strong and we have not experienced any material strikes or work stoppages recently  no assurances can be made that we will not in the future experience these and other types of conflicts with labor unions  works councils  other groups representing employees or our employees generally  or that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in our cost of labor 
inability to protect our intellectual property could negatively affect our competitive position 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we cannot guarantee  however  that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent infringement of our rights or misappropriation of our technology 
for example  effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some of the foreign countries in which we operate 
in addition  while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property  such confidentiality agreements could be breached or otherwise may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and know how related to the design  manufacture or operation of our products 
if it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights  any proceedings could be burdensome and costly  and we may not prevail 
further  adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise 
if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitive position could suffer  which could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
significant changes in pension fund investment performance or assumptions changes may have a material effect on the valuation of our obligations under our defined benefit pension plans  the funded status of these plans and our pension expense 
we maintain defined benefit pension plans that are required to be funded in the us  india  japan  mexico  the netherlands and the united kingdom  and defined benefit plans that are not required to be funded in austria  france  germany and sweden 
our pension liability is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure our pension obligations and  in the case of the plans that are required to be funded  the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
a change in the discount rate can result in a significant increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations  affecting the reported status of our pension plans and our pension expense 
significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets can result in increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets or in a change of the expected rate of return on plan assets 
changes in the expected return on plan assets assumption can result in significant changes in our pension expense and future funding requirements 
we continually review our funding policy related to our us pension plan in accordance with applicable laws and regulations 
the impact of the performance of global financial markets in recent years has reduced the value of investments held in trust to support pension plans 
additionally  us regulations are continually increasing the minimum level of funding for u 
s pension plans 
the combined impact of these changes has required significant contributions to our pension plans in recent years  which is likely to continue  albeit to a lesser extent  in contributions to our pension plans reduce the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital  capital expenditures  research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes 

table of contents we may incur material costs as a result of product liability and warranty claims  which could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we may be exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the event that the use of one of our products results in  or is alleged to result in  bodily injury and or property damage or our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected 
while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims  we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future  and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims 
in addition  product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time  regardless of the ultimate outcome 
an unsuccessful defense of a product liability claim could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products  claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and our company 
warranty claims are not generally covered by insurance  and we may incur significant warranty costs in the future for which we would not be reimbursed 
the recording of increased deferred tax asset valuation allowances in the future could affect our operating results 
we currently have significant net deferred tax assets resulting from tax credit carryforwards  net operating losses and other deductible temporary differences that are available to reduce taxable income in future periods 
based on our assessment of our deferred tax assets  we determined  based on projected future income and certain available tax planning strategies  that approximately million of our deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized in the future  and no valuation allowance is currently required for this portion of our deferred tax assets 
should we determine in the future that these assets will not be realized  we will be required to record an additional valuation allowance in connection with these deferred tax assets and our operating results would be adversely affected in the period such determination is made 
our outstanding indebtedness and the restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness limit our operating and financial flexibility 
we are required to make scheduled repayments and  under certain events of default  mandatory repayments on our outstanding indebtedness  which may require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital  capital expenditures  research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes  such as dividend payments and share repurchases  and could generally limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry 
in addition  the agreements governing our bank credit facilities impose certain operating and financial restrictions on us and somewhat limit management s discretion in operating our businesses 
these agreements limit or restrict our ability  among other things  to incur additional debt  change fiscal year  pay dividends and make other distributions  prepay subordinated debt  make investments and other restricted payments  create liens  sell assets  and enter into transactions with affiliates 
our bank credit facilities also contain covenants requiring us to deliver to lenders certificates of compliance with leverage and interest coverage financial covenants and our audited annual and unaudited quarterly financial statements 
our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control 
failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we may not be able to continue to expand our market presence through acquisitions  and any future acquisitions may present unforeseen integration difficulties or costs 
since  we have expanded through a number of acquisitions  and we may pursue strategic acquisitions of businesses in the future 
our ability to implement this growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition candidates  covenants in our credit agreement and other debt agreements and our financial resources  including available cash and borrowing capacity 
acquisitions may require additional debt financing  
table of contents resulting in higher leverage and an increase in interest expense 
in addition  acquisitions may require large one time charges and can result in the incurrence of contingent liabilities  adverse tax consequences  substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges  the amortization of identifiable purchased intangible assets or impairment of goodwill  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
should we acquire another business  the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may create operating difficulties and may require significant financial and managerial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations 
some of the more common challenges associated with acquisitions that we may experience include loss of key employees or customers of the acquired company  conforming the acquired company s standards  processes  procedures and controls  including accounting systems and controls  with our operations  which could cause deficiencies related to our internal control over financial reporting  coordinating operations that are increased in scope  geographic diversity and complexity  retooling and reprogramming of equipment  hiring additional management and other critical personnel  and the diversion of management s attention from our day to day operations 
further  no guarantees can be made that we would realize the cost savings  synergies or revenue enhancements that we may anticipate from any acquisition  or that we will realize such benefits within the time frame that we expect 
if we are not able to timely address the challenges associated with acquisitions and successfully integrate acquired businesses  or if our integrated product and service offerings fail to achieve market acceptance  our business could be adversely affected

we continue to expand our global supply chain capability to meet global customer demands and ensure the quality and timely delivery of our products 
we continue to devote resources to improving the supply chain processes across our divisions to find areas of synergy and cost reduction and to improve our supply chain management capability to ensure it can meet global customer demands 
we continue to focus on improving on time delivery and quality  while managing warranty costs as a percentage of sales across our global operations  through the assistance of a focused continuous improvement process cip initiative 
the goal of the cip initiative  which includes lean manufacturing  six sigma business management strategy and value engineering  is to maximize service fulfillment to customers through on time delivery  reduced cycle time and quality at the highest internal productivity 
we experienced improved demand for original equipment in as compared with as the effects from the global recession began to diminish  several demand forecasts improved  which promoted increased capital investment spending and planning 
the oil and gas industry saw improved conditions as the developing regions economic growth plans rekindled projections of demand growth for oil and natural gas 
pipeline and refining investments were driven by infrastructure expansion plans in these growing regions 
the developing regions also experienced improved conditions in the investment in chemical processing and power generation 
in the mature regions  all three of these industries experienced a moderate level of investment 
in the area of power generation  uncertainty over environmental regulations challenged spending levels  while overcapacity in oil refining affected capital investments 
the water management industry displayed stability in its spending levels  as investments in this market persist in varying economic conditions 
in  we experienced improved demand in our global aftermarket business as compared with this was driven by our customers need to maintain continuing operations across several industries and the expansion of our aftermarket capabilities provided through our new integrated solutions offerings 
customers desire to gain operational efficiencies and increase throughput from existing facilities provided opportunities to leverage our engineering knowledge and technological capabilities to design solutions that produce the desired business result 
a critical component of our growth strategy remains our investment in expanding our aftermarket capabilities to provide local support to maximize our customers investment in our offerings  as well as to provide business stability during various economic periods 
in  we continued to execute on our strategy to increase our presence in all regions of the global market to capture aftermarket opportunities 
we believe that with our customer relationships  our global presence and our highly regarded technical capabilities  we will continue to have opportunities in our core industries  however  we face challenges affecting many companies in our industry with a significant multi national presence  such as economic  political  currency and other risks 
our markets the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the outlook for section included in this md a 
our products and services are used in several distinct industries oil and gas  chemical  power generation  water management  and a number of other industries that are collectively referred to as general industries 
demand for most of our products depends on the level of new capital investment and planned and unplanned maintenance expenditures by our customers 
the level of new capital investment depends  in turn  on capital infrastructure projects driven by the need for oil and gas  power and water management  as well as general economic conditions 
these drivers are generally related to the phase of the business cycle in their respective industries and the expectations of future market behavior 
the levels of maintenance expenditures are additionally driven by the reliability of equipment  planned and unplanned downtime for maintenance and the required capacity utilization of the process 
our customers include engineering  procurement and construction firms  original equipment manufacturers  end users and distributors 
sales to engineering  procurement and construction firms and original equipment manufacturers are typically for large project orders and critical applications  as are certain sales to distributors 

table of contents project orders are typically procured for customers either directly from us or indirectly through contractors for new construction projects or facility enhancement projects 
the quick turnaround business  which we also refer to as book and ship  is defined as orders that are received from the customer booked and shipped within three months of receipt 
these orders are typically for more standardized  general purpose products  parts or services 
each of our three business segments generates certain levels of this type of business 
in the sale of aftermarket products and services  we benefit from a large installed base of our original equipment  which requires maintenance  repair and replacement parts 
we use our manufacturing platform and global network of qrcs to offer a broad array of aftermarket equipment services  such as installation  advanced diagnostics  repair and retrofitting 
in geographic regions where we are positioned to provide quick response  we believe customers have traditionally relied on us  rather than our competitors  for aftermarket products due to our highly engineered and customized products 
however  the aftermarket for standard products is competitive  as the existence of common standards allows for easier replacement of the installed products 
as proximity of service centers  timeliness of delivery and quality are important considerations for all aftermarket products and services  we continue to expand our global qrc network to improve our ability to capture this important aftermarket business 
oil and gas the oil and gas industry  which represented approximately and of our bookings in and  respectively  experienced increased capital spending activity compared to the previous year due to improved demand outlook and the need to start the infrastructure build in order to bring future capacity on line in time 
the majority of investment by the major oil companies was focused on the upstream production activities  however  there were improved levels of spending in both mid stream pipeline and downstream refining operations particularly in the developing markets 
refining overcapacity remained a concern throughout the year in the mature regions as overall demand for oil fell in these regions 
aftermarket opportunities in this industry remained stable throughout the year 
opportunities presented by our integrated solutions offering helped to offset a reduction in service related business as many refineries performed this work with their own personnel 
the outlook for the oil and gas industry is heavily dependent on the demand growth from both mature markets and developing geographies 
we believe oil and gas companies will continue with upstream and downstream investment plans that are in line with projections of future demand growth and the production declines of existing operations 
a projected decline in demand could cause oil and gas companies to reduce their overall level of spending  which could decrease demand for our products and services 
however  we believe the long term fundamentals for this industry remain solid based on current supply  projected depletion rates of existing fields and forecasted long term demand growth 
with our long standing reputation in providing successful solutions for upstream  mid stream and downstream applications  along with the advancements in our portfolio of offerings  we believe that we continue to be well positioned to pursue the opportunities in this industry around the globe 
chemical the chemical industry represented approximately and of our bookings in and  respectively 
this industry continued to experience challenges relative to capital investment due to the persistent uncertainty around the global economies and lingering recessionary effects in the mature regions 
projected demand growth and economic growth plans within the developing regions supported capital investment for capacity expansion and improvements  although the level of spending remained low compared to previous years 
agriculture was a leading driver of global chemical investment as the population of developing economies required greater food supply increasing the long term need for fertilizer based products 
the aftermarket opportunities remained stable for the majority of the year with signs of improvement in the latter part of the year 
the outlook for the chemical industry remains heavily dependent on global economic conditions 
as global economies stabilize and unemployment conditions improve  a rise in consumer spending should follow 
an increase in spending will drive greater demand for chemical based products supporting improved levels of capital investment 
we believe the chemical industry in the near term will continue to invest in maintenance and upgrades for optimization of existing assets and that developing regions will continue investing in capital infrastructure to 
table of contents meet current and future indigenous demand 
we believe our global presence and our localized aftermarket capabilities are well positioned to serve the potential growth opportunities in this industry 
power generation the power generation industry represented approximately and of our bookings in and  respectively 
the power industry continued to experience some softness in capital spending in the mature regions driven by the uncertainty related to environmental regulations 
in the developing regions  capital investment remained in place driven by increased demand forecasts for electricity in countries such as china and india 
global concerns about the environment continue to support an increase in desired future capacity from renewable and nuclear power 
the majority of the active and planned construction throughout the year continued to utilize designs based on fossil fuels 
natural gas increased its percentage of utilization driven by market prices for gas remaining low and relatively stable 
with the potential of unconventional sources of gas  such as shale gas  the power industry is forecasting an increased use of this form of fuel for generating plants 
we believe the outlook for the power generation industry remains favorable 
current legislative efforts to limit the emissions of carbon dioxide may have an adverse effect on investment plans depending on the potential requirements imposed and the timing of compliance by country 
it is important to note that proposed methods of limiting carbon dioxide emissions offer business opportunities for our products and services 
we believe the long term fundamentals for the power generation industry remain solid based on projected increases in demand for electricity driven by global population growth  advancements of industrialization and growth of urbanization in developing markets 
we also believe that our long standing reputation in the power generation industry  our portfolio of offerings for the various generating methods  our advancements in serving the renewables market and carbon capture methodologies along with our global service and support structure position us well for the future opportunities in this important industry 
water management the water management industry represented approximately and of our bookings in and  respectively 
worldwide demand for fresh water and water treatment continues to create requirements for new facilities or for upgrades of existing systems  many of which require products that we offer  particularly pumps 
we believe that the persistent demand for fresh water during all economic cycles supports continuing investments 
the water management industry is facing a future supply demand challenge relative to forecasted global population growth coupled with the advancement of industrialization and urbanization 
due to the limitations of usable fresh water around the globe  there continues to be an increased investment in desalination 
this investment is forecasted to significantly increase over the next couple of decades 
we believe we are a global leader in the desalination market  which is already an important source of fresh water in the mediterranean region and the middle east 
we expect that this trend in desalination will expand from these traditional areas to other coastal areas around the globe  which we believe presents a significant market opportunity for pumps  valves  actuation products and energy recovery devices 
general industries general industries comprises a variety of different businesses  including mining and ore processing  pharmaceuticals  pulp and paper  food and beverage and other smaller applications  none of which individually represented more than of total bookings in and general industries also include sales to distributors  whose end customers operate in the industries we primarily serve 
general industries represented  in the aggregate  approximately and of our bookings in and  respectively 
in  we saw improving conditions in the majority of these businesses 
pulp and paper  mining and ore processing  as well as food and beverage  all saw improved conditions compared to this was generally supported by the improving economic conditions in several parts of the world 
we also experienced increased business levels through our distribution network as business conditions improved and inventory levels required replenishment 

table of contents the outlook for this group of industries is heavily dependent upon the condition of global economies and the level of consumer confidence 
the long term fundamentals of many of these industries remain sound as many of the products produced by these industries are common staples of industrialized and urbanized economies 
we believe that our specialty product offerings designed for these industries and our aftermarket service capabilities will provide future business opportunities

risk factors of this annual report 
our bookings increased in as compared with  and our backlog at december  increased as compared to december   which is expected to drive increased revenue in as compared with  excluding currency fluctuations 
because a booking represents a contract that can be  in certain circumstances  modified or canceled  and can include varying lengths between the time of booking and the time of revenue recognition  there is no guarantee that the increase in bookings will result in a comparable increase in revenues or otherwise be indicative of future results 
while we believe that our primary markets continue to provide opportunities  as evidenced by nine consecutive quarters of approximately billion in bookings and the year over year increase in our backlog  we remain cautious in our outlook for given the continuing uncertainty of global economic conditions 
while we have not experienced a disruption to our business resulting from recent developing political and economic conditions in the middle east  we will continue to closely monitor the

we expect to experience increased external pressures on gross profit margin in as compared with and due to price competition associated with current global economic conditions 
we expect these gross profit margin pressures to be at least partially offset by planned increases in shipments  operational improvements  continuation of our end user strategy  the strength of our aftermarket business  supply chain initiatives  disciplined contract bidding and savings achieved from our realignment programs 
as part of our previously communicated realignment programs  we plan to incur up to million in realignment costs in as a result of these activities 
all of our borrowings under our new credit facilities carry a floating rate of interest 
as of december   we had million of derivative contracts to convert a portion of floating interest rates to fixed interest rates to reduce our exposure to interest rate volatility 
as a result of reducing the volatility  we may not fully benefit from a decrease in interest rates 
we expect our interest expense in will be comparable to however  because a portion of our debt carries a floating rate of interest  the debt is subject to volatility in rates  which could negatively impact interest expense 
our results of operations may also be impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements

as of december   the gross liability for uncertain tax positions was million 
we do not expect a material payment related to these obligations to be made within the next twelve months 
we are unable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to the uncertain tax positions 
the following table presents a summary of our commercial commitments at december  commitment expiration by period beyond within year years years years total amounts in millions letters of credit surety bonds total we expect to satisfy these commitments through performance under our contracts 
pension and postretirement benefits obligations our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations required by accounting standards codification asc  compensation retirement benefits 
in accounting for retirement plans  management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  salary growth  long term rates of return on plan assets  retirement rates  turnover  health care cost trend rates and mortality rates 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the 
table of contents pension and postretirement benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings 
in addition  the assumptions can materially affect benefit obligations and future cash funding 
plan descriptions we and certain of our subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans for regular full time and part time employees 
approximately of total defined benefit pension plan assets and approximately of defined benefit pension obligations are related to the us qualified plan as of december  the assets for the us qualified plan are held in a single trust with a common asset allocation 
unless specified otherwise  the references in this section are to all of our us and us plans 
benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on participants compensation and years of credited service 
assets under our defined benefit pension plans consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities 
at december   the estimated fair market value of us and us plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans increased to million from million at december  assets were allocated as follows us plan asset category us large cap us small cap international large cap equity securities long term government credit intermediate bond fixed income multi strategy hedge fund other other non us plans asset category north american companies uk companies european companies asian pacific companies global equity emerging markets equity securities uk government gilt index uk corporate bond index global fixed income bond fixed income other less than of holdings are in other and emerging markets

the estimated prior service benefit for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net pension expense in is million 
the estimated actuarial net loss for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net pension expense in is million 
we amortize estimated prior service benefits and estimated net losses over the remaining expected service period or over the remaining expected lifetime of inactive participants for plans with only inactive participants 
we sponsor defined benefit postretirement medical plans covering certain current retirees and a limited number of future retirees in the us these plans provide for medical and dental benefits and are administered through insurance companies 
we fund the plans as benefits are paid  such that the plans hold no assets in any period presented 
accordingly  we have no investment strategy or targeted allocations for plan assets 
the benefits under the plans are not available to new employees or most existing employees 
the benefit obligation for our defined benefit postretirement medical plans was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the estimated prior service benefit for the defined benefit postretirement medical plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net pension expense in is million 
the estimated actuarial net benefit for the defined benefit postretirement medical plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net pension expense in is million 
we amortize estimated prior service benefits and estimated net gain over the remaining expected service period of approximately four years 
accrual accounting and significant assumptions we account for pension benefits using the accrual method  recognizing pension expense before the payment of benefits to retirees 
the accrual method of accounting for pension benefits necessarily requires actuarial assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of the benefit payments 
our key assumptions used in calculating our cost of pension benefits are the discount rate  the rate of compensation increase and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
we  in consultation with our actuaries  evaluate the key actuarial assumptions and other assumptions used in calculating the cost of pension and postretirement benefits  such as discount rates  expected return on plan assets for funded plans  mortality rates  retirement rates and assumed rate of compensation increases  and determine such assumptions as of december of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension and postretirement expense for the following year 
depending on the assumptions used  the pension and postretirement expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings 
in addition  the assumptions can materially affect benefit obligations and future cash funding 
actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors 
see discussion of our assumptions related to pension and postretirement benefits in the our critical accounting estimates section of this md a 
in  net pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans included in income from continuing operations was million compared with million in and million in the gain expense for the postretirement medical plans was million in compared with million in and million in

at december   as compared to december   we decreased our discount rate for the us plan from to based on an analysis of publicly traded investment grade us corporate bonds  which had a lower yield due to current market conditions 
we decreased our average rate for non us plans from to based primarily on lower applicable corporate aa graded bond yields for the uk and euro zone 
we decreased our average assumed rate of compensation from to for the us plan and from to for our non us plans 
to determine the pension expense  we decreased the expected rate of return on 
table of contents us plan assets from to and we increased our average rate of return on non us plan assets from to  primarily as a result of the increase in the uk rate of return on assets 
as the expected rate of return on plan assets is long term in nature  short term market changes do not significantly impact the rates 
we expect that the net pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans included in earnings before income taxes will be approximately million higher in than the million in  reflecting  among other things  the increased amortization of the actuarial net loss 
we expect the benefit for the postretirement medical plans to be approximately million lower than the million in  primarily reflecting decreased amortization of the actuarial net gain 
we have used discount rates of and at december   in calculating our estimated cost of pension benefits and cost of other postretirement benefits for us plans  respectively 
the assumed ranges for the annual rates of increase in health care costs were for  for and for  with a gradual decrease to for and future years 
if actual costs are higher than those assumed  this will likely put modest upward pressure on our expense for retiree health care 
plan funding our funding policy for defined benefit plans is to contribute at least the amounts required under applicable laws and local customs 
we contributed million  million and million to our defined benefit plans in  and  respectively 
after consideration of the impact of our contributions in  the partial recovery in and of asset value declines experienced in and our intent to remain fully funded  we currently anticipate that our contribution to our us pension plan in will be between million and million  excluding direct benefits paid 
we expect to contribute approximately million to our non us pension plans in for further discussions on pension and postretirement benefits  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
our critical accounting estimates the process of preparing financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of related contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon information available at the time of the estimates or assumptions  including our historical experience  where relevant 
the most significant estimates made by management include timing and amount of revenue recognition  deferred taxes  tax valuation allowances and tax reserves  reserves for contingent losses  retirement and postretirement benefits  and valuation of goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets 
the significant estimates are reviewed quarterly by management  and management presents its views to the audit committee of our board of directors 
because of the uncertainty of factors surrounding the estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements  actual results may differ from the estimates  and the difference may be material 
our critical accounting policies are those policies that are both most important to our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments on the part of management in their application  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that the following represent our critical accounting policies 
for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
management and our external auditors have discussed our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition revenues for product sales are recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customers  which is based on the contractual delivery terms agreed to with the customer and fulfillment of all but inconsequential or perfunctory actions 
in addition  our policy requires persuasive evidence of an arrangement  a fixed or determinable sales price and reasonable assurance of collectability 
for contracts containing multiple 
table of contents elements  each having a determinable fair value  we recognize revenue in an amount equal to the element s pro rata share of the contract s fair value in accordance with the contractual delivery terms for each element 
we defer the recognition of revenue when advance payments are received from customers before performance obligations have been completed and or services have been performed 
freight charges billed to customers are included in sales and the related shipping costs are included in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income 
revenues for long term contracts that exceed certain internal thresholds regarding the size and duration of the project and provide for the receipt of progress billings from the customer are recorded on the percentage of completion method with progress measured on a cost to cost basis 
percentage of completion revenue represents less than of our consolidated sales in revenue on service and repair contracts is recognized after services have been agreed to by the customer and rendered 
revenues generated under fixed fee service and repair contracts are recognized on a ratable basis over the term of the contract 
these contracts can range in duration  but generally extend for up to five years 
fixed fee service contracts represent less than of our consolidated sales in in certain instances  we provide guaranteed completion dates under the terms of our contracts 
failure to meet contractual delivery dates can result in late delivery penalties or non recoverable costs 
in instances where the payment of such costs are deemed to be probable  we perform a project profitability analysis accounting for such costs as a reduction of realizable revenues  which could potentially cause estimated total project costs to exceed projected total revenues realized from the project 
in such instances  we would record reserves to cover such excesses in the period they are determined  which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
in circumstances where the total projected reduced revenues still exceed total projected costs  the incurrence of unrealized incentive fees or non recoverable costs generally reduces profitability of the project at the time of subsequent revenue recognition 
our reported results would change if different estimates were used for contract costs or if different estimates were used for contractual contingencies 
deferred taxes  tax valuation allowances and tax reserves we recognize valuation allowances to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to amounts that we expect are more likely than not to be realized 
our valuation allowances primarily relate to the deferred tax assets established for certain tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards for us and non us subsidiaries  and we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the related valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of these allowances  if necessary 
we assess such factors as our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets in determining the sufficiency of our valuation allowances 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable tax jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings 
implementation of different tax structures in certain jurisdictions could  if successful  result in future reductions of certain valuation allowances 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions 
we establish reserves for open tax years for uncertain tax positions that may be subject to challenge by various tax authorities 
the consolidated tax provision and related accruals include the impact of such reasonably estimable losses and related interest and penalties as deemed appropriate 
tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from uncertain tax positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters  and our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities 
to the extent that the expected tax outcome of these matters changes  such changes in estimate will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made 

table of contents reserves for contingent loss liabilities are recorded for various contingencies arising in the normal course of business when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and such loss is estimable 
assessments of reserves are based on information obtained from our independent and in house experts  including recent legal decisions and loss experience in similar situations 
the recorded legal reserves are susceptible to changes due to new developments regarding the facts and circumstances of each matter  changes in political environments  legal venue and other factors 
recorded environmental reserves could change based on further analysis of our properties  technological innovation and regulatory environment changes 
estimates of liabilities for unsettled asbestos related claims are based on known claims and on our experience during the preceding two years for claims filed  settled and dismissed  with adjustments for events deemed unusual and unlikely to recur  and are included in retirement obligations and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
a substantial majority of our asbestos related claims are covered by insurance or indemnities 
estimated indemnities and receivables from insurance carriers for unsettled claims and receivables for settlements and legal fees paid by us for asbestos related claims are estimated using our historical experience with insurance recovery rates and estimates of future recoveries  which include estimates of coverage and financial viability of our insurance carriers 
estimated receivables are included in other assets  net in our consolidated balance sheets 
changes in claims filed  settled and dismissed and differences between actual and estimated settlement costs and insurance or indemnity recoveries could impact future expense 
pension and postretirement benefits we provide pension and postretirement benefits to certain of our employees  including former employees  and their beneficiaries 
the assets  liabilities and expenses we recognize and disclosures we make about plan actuarial and financial information are dependent on the assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
the assumptions include factors such as discount rates  health care cost trend rates  inflation  expected rates of return on plan assets  retirement rates  mortality rates  rates of compensation increases and other factors 
the assumptions utilized to compute expense and benefit obligations are shown in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
these assumptions are assessed annually as of december and adjustments are made as needed 
we evaluate prevailing market conditions and local laws and requirements in countries where plans are maintained  including appropriate rates of return  interest rates and medical inflation rates 
we also compare our significant assumptions with our peers 
the methodology to set our assumptions includes discount rates are estimated using high quality debt securities based on corporate or government bond yields with a duration matching the expected benefit payments 
for the us the discount rate is obtained from an analysis of publicly traded investment grade corporate bonds to establish a weighted average discount rate 
for plans in the united kingdom and the euro zone we use the discount rate obtained from an analysis of aa graded corporate bonds used to generate a yield curve 
for other countries or regions without a corporate aa bond market  government bond rates are used 
our discount rate assumptions are impacted by changes in general economic and market conditions that affect interest rates on long term high quality debt securities  as well as the duration of our plans liabilities 
health care cost trend rates are developed based upon historical retiree cost trend data  long term health care outlook and industry benchmarks 
inflation assumptions are based upon both our specific trends and nationally expected trends 
the expected rates of return on plan assets are derived from reviews of asset allocation strategies  expected long term performance of asset classes  risks and other factors adjusted for our specific investment strategy 
these rates are impacted by changes in general market conditions  but because they are long term in nature  short term market changes do not significantly impact the rates 
changes to our target asset allocation also impact these rates 
retirement rates are based upon actual and projected plan experience 
mortality rates are based on published actuarial tables relevant to the countries in which we have plans 

table of contents the expected rates of compensation increase reflect estimates of the change in future compensation levels due to general price levels  seniority  age and other factors 
we evaluate the funded status of each retirement plan using current assumptions and determine the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements  tax deductibility  reporting considerations  cash flow requirements and other factors  and discuss our funding assumptions with the finance committee of our board of directors 
valuation of goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets the initial recording of goodwill and intangible assets requires subjective judgments concerning estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets 
we test the value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment as of december each year or whenever events or circumstances indicate such assets may be impaired 
the test for goodwill impairment involves significant judgment in estimating projections of fair value generated through future performance of each of the reporting units 
in connection with the segment reorganization  we reallocated goodwill to our redefined reporting units and evaluated goodwill for impairment 
the identification of the reporting units began at the operating segment level epd  ipd and fcd  and considered whether components one level below the operating segment levels should be identified as reporting units for purposes of allocating goodwill and testing goodwill for impairment based on certain conditions 
these conditions included  among other factors  i the extent to which a component represents a business and ii the aggregation of economically similar components within the operating segments  which resulted in nine reporting units 
other factors that were considered in determining whether the aggregation of components was appropriate included the similarity of the nature of the products and services  the nature of the production processes  the methods of distribution and the types of industries served 
the test of indefinite lived intangible assets involves significant judgment in estimating projections of future sales levels 
impairment losses for goodwill are recognized whenever the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on an income approach  whereby we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
a discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about future sales  operating margins  growth rates and discount rates  which are based on our budgets  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows and market participants 
assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long term business plan period 
we did not record an impairment of goodwill in  or we also consider our market capitalization in our evaluation of the fair value of our goodwill 
our market capitalization increased in and did not indicate a potential impairment of our goodwill as of december  impairment losses for indefinite lived intangible assets are recognized whenever the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value 
fair values are calculated for trademarks using a relief from royalty method  which estimates the fair value of the trademarks by determining the present value of the royalty payments that are avoided as a result of owning the trademark 
this method includes judgmental assumptions about sales growth and discount rates that are consistent with the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units discussed above 
we did not record an impairment of our trademarks in  or the net realizable value of other long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and finite lived intangible assets  is reviewed periodically  when indicators of potential impairments are present  based upon an assessment of the estimated future cash flows related to those assets  utilizing a methodology similar to that for goodwill 
additional considerations related to our long lived assets include expected maintenance and improvements  changes in expected uses and ongoing operating performance and utilization 
due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in strategy and product portfolio  it is possible that forecasts used to support asset carrying values may change in the future  which could result in non cash charges that would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have market risk exposure arising from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate movements 
we are exposed to credit related losses in the event of non performance by counterparties to financial instruments  including interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts  but we currently expect all counterparties will continue to meet their obligations given their current creditworthiness 
interest rate risk our earnings are impacted by changes in short term interest rates as a result of borrowings under our new credit facilities  which bear interest based on floating rates 
at december   after the effect of interest rate swaps  we had million of variable rate debt obligations outstanding under our new credit facilities with a weighted average interest rate of 
a hypothetical change of basis points in the interest rate for these borrowings  assuming constant variable rate debt levels  would have changed interest expense by million for the year ended december  at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of notional amount in outstanding interest rate swaps with third parties with varying maturities through september foreign currency exchange rate risk a substantial portion of our operations are conducted by our subsidiaries outside of the us in currencies other than the us dollar 
almost all of our us subsidiaries conduct their business primarily in their local currencies  which are also their functional currencies 
foreign currency exposures arise from translation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars and from transactions  including firm commitments and anticipated transactions  denominated in a currency other than a non us subsidiary s functional currency 
generally  we view our investments in foreign subsidiaries from a long term perspective and  therefore  do not hedge these investments 
we use capital structuring techniques to manage our investment in foreign subsidiaries as deemed necessary 
we realized net losses gains associated with foreign currency translation of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  which are included in other comprehensive expense income 
based on a sensitivity analysis at december   a change in the foreign currency exchange rates for the year ended december  would have impacted our net earnings by approximately million  due primarily to the euro 
this calculation assumes that all currencies change in the same direction and proportion relative to the us dollar and that there are no indirect effects  such as changes in non us dollar sales volumes or prices 
this calculation does not take into account the impact of the foreign currency forward exchange contracts discussed below 
see discussion of the impact in of the devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
we employ a foreign currency risk management strategy to minimize potential changes in cash flows from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements 
where available  the use of forward exchange contracts allows us to mitigate transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the forward exchange contracts will offset  in whole or in part  losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure 
our policy allows foreign currency coverage only for identifiable foreign currency exposures  and changes in the fair values of these instruments are included in other expense income  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
as of december   we had a us dollar equivalent of million in aggregate notional amount outstanding in forward exchange contracts with third parties  compared with million at december  transactional currency gains and losses arising from transactions outside of our sites functional currencies and changes in fair value of certain forward exchange contracts are included in our consolidated results of
