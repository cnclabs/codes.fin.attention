critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
the accounting estimates that require our most significant  difficult  and or subjective judgments include the valuation of inventory  goodwill  intangible assets  warrants  and stock based compensation  assessment of recovery of long lived assets  asset retirement obligations and litigation contingencies  revenue recognition associated with the percentage of completion method  and  the allowance for doubtful accounts and warranty accruals 
we develop estimates based on historical experience and on various assumptions about the future that are believed to be reasonable based on the best information available to us 
our reported financial position or results of operations may be materially different under changed conditions or when using different estimates and assumptions  particularly with respect to significant accounting policies 
in the event that estimates or assumptions prove to differ from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
a listing and description of our critical accounting policies includes the following accounts receivable we regularly evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to meet their financial obligations to us 
the allowance is based on the age of receivables and a specific identification of receivables considered at risk of collection 
we classify charges associated with the allowance for doubtful accounts as sales  general  and administrative expense 
if the financial condition of our customers 
table of contents were to deteriorate  impacting their ability to pay us  additional allowances may be required 
see 
footnote receivables in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our receivables 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using the standard cost method that includes material  labor  and manufacturing overhead costs  which approximates weighted average cost 
we write down inventory once it has been determined that conditions exist that may not allow the inventory to be sold for its intended purpose or the inventory is determined to be excess or obsolete based on our forecasted future revenue 
the charge related to inventory write downs is recorded as a cost of revenue 
the majority of the inventory write downs are related to estimated allowances for inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value and on excess raw material components resulting from finished product obsolescence 
in most cases where we sell previously written down inventory  it is typically sold as a component part of a finished product 
the finished product is sold at market price at the time resulting in higher average gross margin on such revenue 
we do not track the selling price of individual raw material components that have been previously written down or written off  since such raw material components usually are only a portion of the finished products and related sales price 
we evaluate inventory levels at least quarterly against sales forecasts on a significant part by part basis  in addition to determining its overall inventory risk 
we have incurred  and may in the future incur charges to write down our inventory 
see 
footnote inventory in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our inventory 
goodwill the company goodwill of approximately million is associated with our photovoltaics segment 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
as required by asc  intangibles goodwill and other  we evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
pursuant to asc  circumstances that could trigger an interim impairment test include but are not limited to macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions  limitations on accessing capital  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  or other developments in equity and credit markets  industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates  an increased competitive environment  a decline in market dependent multiples or metrics considered in both absolute terms and relative to peers  a change in the market for an entity products or services  or a regulatory or political development  cost factors such as increases in raw materials  labor  or other costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows  overall financial performance such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or planned revenue or earnings compared with actual and projected results of relevant prior periods  other relevant entity specific events such as changes in management  key personnel  strategy  or customers  contemplation of bankruptcy  or litigation  events affecting a reporting unit such as a change in the composition or carrying amount of its net assets  a more likely than not expectation of selling or disposing all  or a portion  of a reporting unit  the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  or recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit  and  if applicable  a sustained decrease in share price considered in both absolute terms and relative to peers 
in performing goodwill impairment testing  we determine the fair value of each reporting unit using a weighted combination of a market based approach and a discounted cash flow dcf approach 
the market based approach relies on values based on market multiples derived from comparable public companies 
in applying the dcf approach  management forecasts cash flows over the remaining useful life of its primary asset using assumptions of current economic conditions and future expectations of earnings 
this analysis requires the exercise of significant judgment  including judgments about appropriate discount rates based on the assessment of risks inherent in the amount and timing of projected future cash flows 
the derived discount rate 
table of contents may fluctuate from period to period as it is based on external market conditions 
all of these assumptions are critical to the estimate and can change from period to period 
updates to these assumptions in future periods  particularly changes in discount rates  could result in different results of goodwill impairment tests 
see 
footnote goodwill in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to our goodwill 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant  and equipment and intangible assets 
because most of our long lived assets are subject to amortization  we review these assets for impairment in accordance with the provisions of asc  property  plant  and equipment 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
our impairment testing of long lived assets consists of determining whether the carrying amount of the long lived asset asset group is recoverable  in other words  whether the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset asset group exceeds its carrying amount 
the determination of the existence of impairment involves judgments that are subjective in nature and may require the use of estimates in forecasting future results and cash flows related to an asset or group of assets 
in making this determination  we use certain assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  the length of service that assets will be used in our operations  and estimated salvage values

revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon shipment  provided persuasive evidence of a contract exists  the price is fixed  the product meets our customer specifications  title and ownership have transferred to the customer  and there is reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
the majority of our products have shipping terms that are free on board or free carrier alongside fca shipping point  which means that we fulfill our delivery obligation when the goods are handed over to the freight carrier at our shipping dock 
this means the buyer bears all costs and risks of loss or damage to the goods from that point 
in certain cases  we ship our products cost insurance and freight 
under this arrangement  revenue is recognized under fca shipping point terms  but we pay and invoice the customer for the cost of shipping and insurance to the customer designated location 
we account for shipping and related transportation costs by recording the charges that are invoiced to customers as revenue  with the corresponding cost recorded as cost of revenue 
in those instances where inventory is maintained at a consigned location  revenue is recognized only when our customer pulls product for use and after title and ownership has transferred to the customer 
revenue from time and material contracts is recognized at contractual rates as labor hours and direct expenses are incurred 
any warranty cost and remaining obligations that are inconsequential or perfunctory are accrued when the corresponding revenue is recognized 
distributors 
we use a number of distributors around the world and recognize revenue upon shipment of product to these distributors 
title and risk of loss pass to the distributors upon shipment  and our distributors are contractually obligated to pay us on standard commercial terms  just like our other direct customers 
we do not sell to our distributors on consignment and  except in the event of product discontinuance  do not give distributors a right of return 
solar panel and solar power systems contracts 
pursuant to asc  revenue recognition construction type and production  we record revenue on long term solar panel and solar power system contracts using either the percentage of completion method or the completed contract method 
in general  the performance of these types of contracts involves the design  development  and manufacture of complex aerospace or electronic equipment to our customer specifications 
the percentage of completion method is used in circumstances in which all the following conditions exist the contract includes enforceable rights regarding goods or services to be provided to the customer  the consideration to be exchanged  and the manner and terms of settlement  both the company and the customer are expected to satisfy all of the contractual obligations  and  reasonably reliable estimates of total revenue  total cost  and the progress towards completion can be made 

table of contents the percentage of completion method recognizes estimates for contract revenue and costs in progress as work on the contract continues 
estimates are revised as additional information becomes available 
if estimates of costs to complete a contract indicate a loss  a provision is made at that time for the total loss anticipated on the contract 
we use the completed contract method if reasonably dependable estimates cannot be made or for which inherent hazards make estimates doubtful 
under the completed contract method  contract revenue and costs in progress are deferred as work on the contract continues 
if a loss becomes evident on the contract  a provision is made at that time for the total loss anticipated on the contract 
total contract revenue and related costs are recognized upon the completion of the contract 
government research and development contracts 
revenue from research and development contracts represents reimbursement by various us government entities  or their contractors  to aid in the development of new technology 
the applicable contracts generally provide that we may elect to retain ownership of inventions made in performing the work  subject to a non exclusive license retained by the us government to practice the inventions for governmental purposes 
the research and development contract funding may be based on a cost plus  cost reimbursement  or a firm fixed price arrangement 
the amount of funding under each research and development contract is determined based on cost estimates that include both direct and indirect costs 
cost plus funding is determined based on actual costs plus a set margin 
as we incur costs under cost reimbursement type contracts  revenue is recorded 
contract costs include material  labor  special tooling and test equipment  subcontracting costs  as well as an allocation of indirect costs 
a research and development contract is considered complete when all significant costs have been incurred  milestones have been reached  and any reporting obligations to the customer have been met 
these contracts may be modified or terminated at the convenience of the us government and may be subject to governmental budgetary fluctuations 
we also participate in cost sharing research and development arrangements 
under such arrangements in which the actual costs of performance are split between the us government and us on a best efforts basis  no revenue is recorded and our research and development expense is reduced for the amount of the cost sharing receipts 
multiple element arrangements 
contracts with our customers usually relate to either the delivery of product or the completion of technology or engineering research and development contracts 
in a very limited number of cases  a research contract may involve the creation and delivery of a customer designed product sample based upon the research and development efforts completed 
pursuant to asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  we have concluded that product revenue should not be considered a unit of accounting separate from the service revenue for these types of research contracts 
contract manufacturers 
in our fiber optics segment  prior to certain customers accepting product that is manufactured at one of our contract manufacturers  these customers require that they first qualify the product and manufacturing processes at our contract manufacturer 
the customers qualification process determines whether the product manufactured at our contract manufacturer achieves their quality  performance  and reliability standards 
after a customer completes the initial qualification process  we receive approval to ship qualified product to that customer 
as part of the manufacturing process at our contract manufacturers  the finished product is tested prior to shipment to the customer using the same criteria that our customer uses to test product it receives 
revenue is recognized upon shipment of customer qualified product  provided persuasive evidence of a contract exists  the price is fixed  the product meets our customer specifications  title and ownership have transferred to the customer  and there is reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
product warranty reserves we provide our customers with limited rights of return for non conforming shipments and warranty claims for certain products 
pursuant to asc  contingencies  we make estimates of product warranty expense using historical experience rates as a percentage of revenue and or costs of revenue and accrue estimated warranty expense as a cost of revenue 
we estimate the costs of our warranty obligations based on historical experience of known product failure rates and anticipated rates if warranty claims  use of materials to repair or replace defective products  and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product issues 
in addition  from time to time  specific warranty accruals may be made if unforeseen technical problems arise 
should our actual experience relative to these factors differ from our estimates  we may be required to record additional warranty reserves 
alternatively  if we provide more reserves than needed  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods 
see 
footnote accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to our product warranty reserves 

table of contents stock based compensation stock based compensation expense is measured at the stock option grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recorded to cost of sales  sales  general  and administrative  and research and development expense based on an employee responsibility and function over the requisite service period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model and the straight line attribution approach to determine the fair value of stock based awards in accordance with asc  compensation 
this option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option expected life  the price volatility of the underlying stock  and expected forfeitures 
expected term represents the period that stock based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior as influenced by changes to the terms of its stock based awards 
the expected stock price volatility is based on our historical stock prices 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
if we use different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if actual forfeitures differ materially from our estimated forfeitures  the change in our non cash stock based compensation expense could adversely affect our results of operations 
see 
footnote equity in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to our stock based compensation 
litigation contingencies we are subject to various legal proceedings  claims  and litigation  either asserted or unasserted that arise in the ordinary course of business 
while the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable  we do not expect the resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
however  the results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty 
professional legal fees are expensed when incurred 
we accrue for contingent losses when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable 
in the event that estimates or assumptions prove to differ from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
should we fail to prevail in any legal matter or should several legal matters be resolved against the company in the same reporting period  then the financial results of that particular reporting period could be materially affected

footnote commitments and contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for disclosures related to our legal proceedings 
warrant valuation as of september  and  warrants representing  shares of our common stock were outstanding 
all of our warrants are classified as a liability since the warrants meet the classification requirements for liability accounting pursuant to asc  derivatives and hedging 
each quarter  we expect an impact on our statement of operations when we record the change in fair value of our outstanding warrants using the monte carlo option valuation model 
the monte carlo option valuation model is used since it allows the valuation of each warrant to factor in the value associated with our right to affect a mandatory exercise of each warrant 
the valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the warrant expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
the change in the fair value of the warrants is primarily due to the change in the closing price of our common stock 
see 
footnote fair value accounting in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to our valuation of our outstanding warrants 
asset retirement obligations pursuant to asc  asset retirement and environmental obligations  an asset retirement obligation is recorded when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset and the fair value of the liability can reasonably be estimated 
upon initial recognition of an asset retirement obligation  a company increases the carrying amount of the long lived asset by the same amount as the liability 
over time  the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value through charges to operations costs 
the initial capitalized costs are depleted over the useful lives of the related assets through charges to depreciation  depletion  and or amortization 
if the fair value of the estimated asset retirement obligation changes  an adjustment is recorded to both the asset retirement obligation and the asset retirement cost 
revisions in estimated liabilities can result from revisions of estimated inflation rates  escalating retirement costs  and changes in the estimated timing of settling asset retirement obligations 

table of contents we have known conditional asset retirement conditions  such as certain asset decommissioning and restoration of rented facilities to be performed in the future 
during the three months ended september   we completed a review of our asset retirement and environmental obligations and we recorded an asset retirement obligation with an offset to fixed assets totaling million

explanatory note on page for a discussion associated with the impact of the floods in thailand on our operations in fiscal liquidity and capital resources historically  we have consumed cash from operations and incurred significant net losses 
for the years ended september   and  we incurred net losses of million  million and million  respectively 
we have managed our liquidity position through a series of cost reduction initiatives  borrowings under our line of credit agreement  capital markets transactions  and the sale of assets 
as of september   cash and cash equivalents was approximately million and working capital totaled million 
working capital  calculated as current assets minus current liabilities  is a financial metric we use that represents available operating liquidity 
for the fiscal years ended september   and net cash provided by used in operating activities totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
in addition  on october   our primary contract manufacturer announced that  as a result of the flooding in thailand  it had suspended operations at its facility that is used to manufacture certain of our fiber optics products 
rising water penetrated the facility and submerged most of our manufacturing and test equipment as well as our inventory at the facility 
we expect to write off the carrying value of damaged equipment and inventory which is estimated to be in the range of to million 
we expect that flooding at our primary contract manufacturer in thailand will have a significant adverse impact on our operations and our ability to meet customer demand for our fiber optics products 
we are currently focused on rebuilding the manufacturing infrastructure for our impacted product lines 
as a result of the flood  certain inventory and fixed assets were damaged or destroyed 
our contract manufacturer is required under its production agreement with us to reimburse us for losses to fixed assets and inventory incurred while at the manufacturer facilities 
we are working with our contract manufacturer and the contract manufacturer insurance carrier to receive insurance proceeds to cover the direct damages to our assets that were impacted by the flood 
we are not a named beneficiary of our contract manufacturer insurance policy 
the timing and amounts of the recovery from the contract manufacturer  including insurance proceeds  are uncertain at this time 
additionally  we claimed damages under our own insurance policy relating to business interruption due to the flooding 
to date  we have collected million from our policy and we expect to receive an additional million by january with respect to measures taken to improve liquidity on november   we entered into a credit and security agreement credit facility with wells fargo bank wells fargo 
the credit facility provides us with a three year revolving credit of up to million that can be used for working capital requirements  letters of credit  and other general corporate purposes 
the credit facility was initially secured by the company accounts receivables and inventory assets and was subject to a borrowing base formula based on the company eligible accounts receivable and inventory accounts 
on december   we signed an amendment to our credit facility that increased our eligible borrowing base by up to million by adding to the borrowing base formula of the appraised value of the company equipment and of the appraised value of the company real estate  for which the appraisals are currently in process 
in addition  wells fargo reduced our restrictions under the excess availability financial covenant requirement from million to million through december the interest rate on outstanding borrowings was increased to libor rate plus four percent 
we now expect at least of the total amount of credit under the credit facility to be available for use based on the revised borrowing base formula during fiscal year  of which million was borrowed at september  
table of contents the credit facility contains customary representations and warranties  and affirmative and negative covenants  including  among other things  cash balance and excess availability requirements  minimum tangible net worth and ebitda covenants and limitations on liens and certain additional indebtedness and guarantees 
the covenants are written such that as long as we maintain the minimum cash balance and excess availability requirement of million prior to the amendment  and million following the amendment  the other covenants are not required to be met 
as of september   we were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the credit facility since cash on deposit and excess availability exceeded the million financial covenant requirement 
the credit facility also contains certain events of default  including a subjective acceleration clause 
under this clause  wells fargo may declare an event of default if it believes in good faith that our ability to pay all or any portion of its indebtedness with wells fargo or to perform any of its material obligations under the credit facility has been impaired  or if it believes in good faith that there has been a material adverse change in the business or financial condition of the company 
if an event of default is not cured within the grace period if applicable  then wells fargo may  among other things  accelerate repayment of amounts borrowed under the credit facility  cease making advances under the credit facility or take possession of the company assets that secure its obligations under the credit facility 
we do not anticipate at this time any change in the business or financial condition of the company that could be deemed a material adverse change by wells fargo 
wells fargo has confirmed that they do not consider the flooding at our contract manufacturer to be a material adverse change in the business or financial condition of the company 
on august   we entered into a committed equity line financing facility equity facility with commerce court small cap value fund  ltd 
commerce court whereby commerce court has committed  upon issuance of a draw down request by us  to purchase up to million worth of our common stock over a two year period  subject to our common stock trading above per share during the draw down period  unless a waiver is received 
in november  we implemented various cost reduction measures  including temporary salary reduction  furlough  reduction of discretionary spending including travel  capital expenditures  and development material costs  and improve working capital management 
we believe that our cost reduction activities will reduce the overall cost structure of our operations 
we also entered into an agreement with our contract manufacturer whereby our contract manufacturer will purchase equipment to rebuild our affected manufacturing lines for which we will repay our contract manufacturer from insurance proceeds received from that contract manufacturer 
additionally  we restructured our outstanding payables owed to our contract manufacturer  which delayed payments to future dates to coincide with expected timing of insurance proceeds 
in december  we signed agreements with certain customers pursuant to which they will receive an allocation of our finished goods inventory as well as a percentage of future output from our new production lines being placed into service in fiscal as consideration  we have received partial prepayments for future product shipments 
these advanced payments will be used to support our working capital requirements until we receive the insurance proceeds 
we believe that our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents  the cash expected to be generated from operations  the agreement with our contract manufacturer to delay payment terms and purchase equipment  expected insurance proceeds  and amounts expected to be available under our credit facility with wells fargo and our equity facility will provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our cash requirements for operations  working capital  and capital expenditures for the next months 
however  in the event of unforeseen circumstances  unfavorable market or economic developments  unfavorable results from operations  or if wells fargo declares an event of default on the credit facility  we may have to raise additional funds by any one or a combination of the following issuing equity  debt or convertible debt  or selling certain product lines and or portions of our business 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
a significant contraction in the capital markets  particularly in the technology sector  may make it difficult for us to raise additional capital if or when it is required  especially if we experience negative operating results 
if adequate capital is not available to us as required  or is not available on favorable terms  our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows may be adversely affected

the fair value was estimated by discounting projected cash flows over the estimated life of the related assets using credit adjusted risk free rates which ranged from to 
the asset retirement obligations in the table above includes assumptions related to renewal option periods where we expect to extend facility lease terms 
in future periods  the asset retirement obligation is accreted for the change in its present value and capitalized costs are depreciated over the useful life of the related assets 
if the fair value of the estimated asset retirement obligation changes  an adjustment will be recorded to both the asset retirement obligation and the asset retirement capitalized cost 
revisions in estimated liabilities can result from revisions of estimated inflation rates  escalating retirement

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
foreign currency exchange risks the united states dollar is the functional currency for our consolidated financial statements 
the functional currency of our spanish subsidiary is the euro 
the functional currency for our china subsidiary is the yuan renminbi 
we recognize gains and losses due to the effect of exchange rate changes on foreign currency primarily due to our operations in spain  the netherlands  and in china 
the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated from their respective functional currencies into us dollars at the rates in effect at the consolidated balance sheet dates  and the revenue and expense amounts are translated at the average rate during the applicable periods reflected on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income 
gains and losses from foreign currency transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  both realized and unrealized  are recorded as foreign exchange gain loss on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
a majority of the gain or losses recorded relates to the change in value of the euro and yuan renminbi relative to the us dollar 
during the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the euro 
to reduce the impact of these risks on our earnings and to increase the predictability of cash flows  we use natural offsets in receipts and disbursements within the applicable currency as the primary means of reducing the risk 
some of our foreign suppliers may adjust their prices in us from time to time to reflect currency exchange fluctuations  and such price changes could impact our future financial condition or results of operations 
we do not currently hedge our foreign currency exposure 
interest rate risks on november   we entered into a credit and security agreement credit facility with wells fargo bank 
the credit facility provides us with a three year revolving credit of up to million that can be used for working capital requirements  letters of credit  and other general corporate purposes 
the credit facility was initially secured by the company accounts receivables and inventory assets and was subject to a borrowing base formula based on the company eligible accounts receivable and inventory accounts 
as of september   we had a million libor rate loan outstanding  with an interest rate of  and approximately million reserved under eight outstanding standby letters of credit under the credit facility

in addition  wells fargo bank reduced our restrictions under the excess availability financial covenant requirement from million to million through december we now expect at least of the total amount of credit under the credit facility to be available for use based on the revised borrowing base formula during fiscal year the interest rate on outstanding borrowings was increased to libor rate plus four percent 
an increase in the interest rate increases interest expense incurred on amounts borrowed by us 
see 
footnote credit facilities for additional information related to our bank credit facility 
inflation risks inflationary factors  such as increases in material costs and operating expenses  may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  an increase in the rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse affect on the levels of gross profit and operating expenses as a percentage of revenue if the sales prices for our products do not proportionately increase with these increases expenses 
credit market conditions recently  the us and global capital markets have been experiencing turbulent conditions  particularly in the credit markets  as evidenced by tightening of lending standards  reduced availability of credit  and reductions in certain asset values 
this could impact our ability to obtain additional funding through financing or asset sales
