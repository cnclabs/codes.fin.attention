carrier systems division revenue decreased million or due to continued delays in capital spending decisions related to large investments in perpetually licensed back end systems designed for use by large insurance companies as also ebix changing its revenue model for new prospective clients  from a license based model to a subscription based recurring model 
with improving domestic and world wide economic conditions during we would expect these insurance carriers to deploy new technologies and increase their spending for system development  and that our revenues from this channel will increase as also become more recurring in nature during the forthcoming year 
costs of services provided costs of services provided  which includes costs associated with customer support  consulting  implementation  and training services  increased million or  from million in to million in this cost increase is attributable to additional personnel  professional services  and facility costs associated with our acquisitions of e z data and peak  the expansion into the latin america market  and the increased research development efforts towards designing new futuristic on demand based services 
product development expenses product development expenses increased million or  from million in to million in the company s product development efforts are focused on the development new technologies for insurance carriers  brokers and agents  and the development of new exchanges for international and domestic markets 
this cost increase is associated with the continued expansion of our technical operations in india and our intellectual property management operations in singapore  both in support of the company s exchange  broker systems  and carrier systems divisions 
this increase is primarily due to costs associated with new product development activities in support of our exchange and bpo channels 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses increased million or  from million in to million in this expense increase is primarily attributable to additional personnel  marketing  consulting  and facility related costs in support of the increased revenues generated by our exchange and broker systems channels

also a factor contributing the net increase to general and administrative expenses was the thousand of potential bad expense that was recognized in connection with the company s decision to increase its reserve for doubtful accounts receivable 
partially offsetting these increases in general and administrative expenses was a million benefit associated with the reversal of a previously recorded contingent liability earnout obligation associated with our october acquisition of peak  because during the subsequent earnout period the defined revenue targets was not achieved by the peak operations 
amortization and depreciation expenses amortization and depreciation expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in this increase is due to million of additional amortization expense incurred in connection with the customer relationship  developed technology  and non compete intangible assets that were recognized in connection with our business acquisitions of mcn  trades monitor  and usix  and our business acquisitions of e z data  facts  and peak 
we also incurred increased depreciation expense amounting to thousand related to additional capital equipment expenditures in support of our growing businesses 
interest income interest income increased thousand or from thousand in to thousand in primarily due to earnings realized on funds invested in foreign banks 
interest expense interest expense decreased thousand or from million in to thousand in this decrease is primarily due to the full conversion of million of convertible debt during the third and fourth quarters thereby ceasing further recognition of the imputed interest expense associated with these debt instruments 
other non operating income other non operating income of million for the year ending december  consists of a million gain recognized for the decrease in the fair value of the put option that was issued to the two former stockholders of e z data whom received shares of ebix common stock as part of the acquisition consideration paid by the company  and a thousand gain realized upon the sale of a building 
foreign exchange gain net foreign exchange gains decreased thousand or from million in to million in this net decrease is due to the thousand impact of re measuring certain intercompany debt obligations largely offset by thousand of gains recorded in connection with the changes in the fair value of the related derivative instruments the company holds to hedge the impact of fluctuations in the exchange rates in the foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our international operations 
income taxes income tax expense decreased thousand  or  from million in to thousand in our effective tax rate was for the twelve months ended december   down from for the same period in primarily affecting the decrease in income tax expense and our consolidated effective tax rate was the benefit recognized from the million release of the remaining valuation allowance that had been held against cumulative legacy net operating loss nol carryforwards in the united states 
this valuation allowance was released as management believes that the uncertainties that had existed as to the performance of our health benefits exchange operating segment related to the potential adverse impacts associated with the than pending health care legislation are no longer relevant 
total income tax expense and the effective tax rate before the release of valuation allowance would have been approximately million and respectively

exchange division revenues increased million  which was primarily due to net increases of approximately million from the health insurance sector and million from the life annuity sector

the company was able to increase sales in this product channel in spite of the downturn in the housing industry which drove down the transaction volume derived from clients associated with the construction industry 
broker systems division revenue decreased thousand which was primarily caused by a thousand reduction in support and maintenance revenues associated with our legacy products as we continue to migrate customers off of these older platforms  and the strengthening of us dollar against the australian dollar which appreciated by during the year and resulted in an approximate drop of thousand of reported revenues from our broker systems operations in australia 
the revenue declines were partially offset by thousand of sales growth from our in our broker system operations in new zealand 
the revenue decline largely can be associated to the overall downturn in the worldwide insurance markets in  resulting in brokers spending less money on back end systems 
carrier systems division revenue decreased thousand due to temporary delays in capital spending decisions as related to investments in back end systems by large insurance companies 
during we expect these insurance carriers to deploy new technologies and increase their spending for system development  and that our revenues from this channel will improve during the forthcoming year

liquidity and capital resources our ability to generate significant cash flows from operating activities is one the company s fundamental financial strengths 
our principal sources of liquidity are the cash flows provided by our operating activities  our revolving credit facility  and cash and cash equivalents on hand 
due to the effect of temporary or timing differences resulting from the differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes and minimum alternative tax obligations in the us and india  future cash outlays for income taxes are expected to exceed current income tax expense but will not adversely impact the company s liquidity position 
we intend to utilize cash flows generated by our ongoing operating activities  in combination with possibly expanding our commercial lending facility  and the possible issuance of additional equity or debt securities to fund capital expenditures and organic growth initiatives  to make acquisitions  to retire outstanding indebtedness  and to possibly repurchase shares of our common stock as market and operation conditions warrant 
the company intends to secure the best possible returns from the use of its operating cash flows 
towards this end the company believes that its available cash resources can generate much higher returns for its shareholders  by both reducing outstanding debt  and by investing in accretive acquisitions and organic growth initiatives  rather than by issuing dividends 
while the company does not completely rule out the possibility of issuing dividends in the future  at present it is more inclined to use its cash to generate further improvement in future earnings 
we believe that anticipated cash flows provided by our operating activities  together with current cash balances and access to our credit facilities and the capital markets  if required  will be sufficient to meet our projected cash requirements for the next twelve months  and the foreseeable future thereafter  although any projections of future cash needs  cash flows  and the general market condition for credit and equity securities may be subject to substantial uncertainty 
in the event additional liquidity needs arise  we may raise funds from a combination of sources  including the potential issuance of debt or equity securities 
we continue to strategically evaluate our ability to sell additional equity or debt securities  to expand existing or obtain new credit facilities from lenders in order to strengthen our financial position 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our shareholders 
we regularly evaluate our liquidity requirements  including the need for additional debt or equity offerings  when considering potential business acquisitions  development of new products or services  or the retirement of debt 
during the company intends to utilize its cash and other financing resources towards making strategic accretive acquisitions in the insurance data exchange arena

recent accounting pronouncements the following is a brief discussion of recently released accounting pronouncements that are pertinent to the company s business in december  the emerging issues task force of the fasb reached consensus regarding the disclosure of pro forma information for business combinations 
this new guidance addressed the diversity in practice concerning the interpretation of the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations 
the guidance specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
the amendments affect any public entity that enters into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis 
the new guidance is applicable to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the company is adopting this new guidance in the first quarter of and will apply this guidance to our recent acquisition of adam  completed in february in january  the fasb issued new guidance regarding disclosures about fair value measurements 
the guidance requires additional disclosures and clarifies some existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurement as set forth in earlier related guidance 
specifically this new guidance now requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers  and for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs  a reporting entity should present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements 
also a reporting entity should provide disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
this new guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
early application is permitted 
the company adopted and applied this pronouncement during its current year ending december  in september  fasb issued amended revenue recognition guidance related to revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this new pronouncement a provides application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist in an arrangement with a customer  and if so  how the arrangement consideration should be separated and allocated  b requires an entity to allocate revenue using estimated selling prices of deliverables if vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or third party evidence tpe of selling prices is not available  and  c eliminates the use of the residual method to allocate revenue 
this guidance is to be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with earlier application permitted 
alternatively  an entity can elect to adopt new guidance on a retrospective basis 
the company is adopting this new guidance in the first quarter of also in september  the fasb issued new guidance related to certain revenue arrangements that include software elements which removes tangible products from the scope of previously issued authoritative guidance on software revenue recognition and provides guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that include tangible products are within the scope of existing software revenue guidance 
this guidance is to be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with earlier application permitted 
alternatively  an entity can elect to adopt new guidance on a retrospective basis 
the company will adopt this new guidance in but does not expect its adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows  as the sale of tangible products are not a significant component of the company s revenues 
in december  the fasb issued new accounting guidance pertaining to the accounting for business combinations and related disclosures 
this new guidance addresses the recognition and accounting for identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and non controlling interests in business combinations 
the guidance also establishes expanded disclosure requirements for business and improves the relevance  representational faithfulness  and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects 
the guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and we applied this new pronouncement to each of our business acquisitions consummated during both the years ending december  and 
table of contents application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  as promulgated in the united states  requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe the most complex and sensitive judgments  because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements  result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following accounting policies involve the use of critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
for additional information about these policies  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions and judgments are reasonable  they are limited based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
revenue recognition the company derives its revenues primarily from professional and support services  which includes subscription and transaction fees pertaining to services delivered over our exchanges or from our asp platforms  revenue generated from software development projects and associated fees for consulting  implementation  training  and project management provided to customers with installed systems  and business process outsourcing revenue 
sales and value added taxes are not included in revenues  but rather are recorded as a liability until the taxes assessed are remitted to the respective taxing authorities 
in accordance with financial accounting standard board fasb and securities and exchange commission staff accounting sec accounting guidance on revenue recognition the company considers revenue earned and realizable when a persuasive evidence of the sales arrangement exists  b the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable  c service delivery or performance has occurred  d customer acceptance has been received  if contractually required  and e collectability of the arrangement fee is probable 
the company typically uses signed contractual agreements as persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement 
we apply the provisions of the relevant fasb accounting pronouncements when making estimates or assumptions related to transactions involving the license of software where the software deliverables are considered more than inconsequential to the other elements in the arrangement 
for contracts that contain multiple deliverables  we analyze the revenue arrangements when making estimates or assumptions in accordance with the appropriate authoritative guidance  which provides criteria governing how to determine whether goods or services that are delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement should be considered as separate units of accounting for the purpose of revenue recognition 
deliverables are accounted for separately if they meet all of the following criteria a the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  b there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items  and c if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items  the delivery or performance of the undelivered items is probable and substantially controlled by the company 
the company begins to recognize revenue from license fees for its asp products upon delivery and the customer s acceptance of the software implementation and customizations if necessary and applicable 
transaction services fee revenue for this use of our exchanges or asp platforms is recognized as the transactions occur and are generally billed in arrears 
service fees for hosting arrangements are recognized over the requisite service period 
revenue derived from the licensing of third party software products in connection with sales of the company s software licenses and is recognized upon delivery together with the company s licensed software products 
training  data conversion  installation  and consulting services fees are recognized as revenue when the services are performed 
revenue for maintenance and support services is recognized ratably over the term of the support agreement 
revenues derived from initial setup or registration fees are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement in accordance with fasb and sec accounting guidance on revenue recognition

valuation of goodwill goodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of the identifiable net assets of acquired businesses 
the company applies the provisions of the fasb s accounting guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets which addresses how goodwill and other acquired intangible assets should be accounted for in financial statements 
in this regard we test these intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment are present 
such potential impairment indicators include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  and the sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business 
the testing involves comparing the reporting unit and intangible asset carrying values to their respective fair values  we determine fair value by applying the discounted cash flow method using the present value of future estimated net cash flows 
the cash flow projections are based on our views of growth rates  anticipated future economic conditions and the appropriate discount rates relative to risk and estimates of residual values 
we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 
the use of different estimates or assumptions for our projected discounted cash flows eg  growth rates  future economic conditions  discount rates and estimates of terminal values when determining the fair value of our reporting units could result in different values and may result in a goodwill impairment charge 
during the twelve months ended december    and  we had no impairment of our reporting unit goodwill balances

income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb accounting guidance on the accounting and disclosure of income taxes  which involves estimating the company s current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we then assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled  and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
in this regard a valuation allowance in the amount of million is being maintained to fully offset the deferred tax assets associated with cumulative nol s that were obtained in connection with previous business acquisitions and for which realization of these assets is not assured due to uncertainties principally associated with limitations on the usage of these acquired nol s posed by section of the us internal revenue code 
the company has not provided deferred us taxes on its unremitted foreign earnings because it considers them to be permanently re invested 
the company follows the provisions of fasb accounting guidance on accounting for uncertain income tax positions 
this guidance clarified the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
the guidance utilizes a two step approach for evaluating tax positions 
recognition step occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
measurement step is only addressed if step has been satisfied 
under step  the tax benefit is measured at the largest amount of benefit  determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon final settlement

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to certain market risks  including foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rates risk is related to our foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of those currencies 
a majority of the company s operations are based in the us and  accordingly  a large component of our business transactions are denominated in us dollars  however  the company has operations in australia  new zealand  singapore  and india  and we conduct transactions in the local currencies of each location 
there can be no assurance that fluctuations in the value of those foreign currencies will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  revenues or financial condition 
during the years of   and the net change in the cumulative foreign currency translation account  which is a component of stockholders equity  was an unrealized gain loss of million  million  and million  respectively 
the company considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in our respective foreign currency exchange rates of could possibly be experienced in the near term future 
such an adverse change in currency exchange rates would have resulted in reduction to pre tax income of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk relates to its interest expense on outstanding debt obligations and to its interest income on existing cash balances 
as of december  the company had million of outstanding debt obligations which consisted of a million balance on our commercial banking revolving line of credit  a million secured term loan  a million convertible promissory note with rennes  and a thousand revolving line of credit with banco santander brazil sa the company s major revolving line of credit bears interest at the rate of libor  and stood at at december  the company is exposed to market risk in relation to this line of credit in regards to the potential increase to interest expense arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
this interest rate risk is estimated as the potential decrease in earnings resulting from a hypothetical increase in the libor rate 
such an adverse change in the libor rate would have resulted in a reduction to pre tax income of approximately thousand and thousand for the years ending december  and  respectively 
the company s average cash balances during were million and its existing cash balances as of december  was million 
the company is exposed to market risk in relation to these cash balances in regards to the potential loss of interest income arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
this interest rate risk is estimated as the potential decrease in earnings resulting from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates earned on deposited funds 
such an adverse change in these interest rates would have resulted in a reduction to pre tax income of approximately thousand and thousand for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the years ended december  and  we entered into a series of one year forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the intercompany receivables originated by our indian subsidiary that are denominated in united states dollars 
these u 
s dollars indian rupee hedges are intended to partially offset the impact of movement in exchange rates on future operating costs  and to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in u 
s dollars indian rupee currency exchange rate 
as of december   the notional value of these contracts which are scheduled to mature in march and september is million 
changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recognized in our consolidated income statement 
we use these instruments as economic hedges  intended to mitigate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates  and not for speculative purposes 
these derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are do significantly offset gains and losses on the intercompany receivables being hedged 
for the twelve months ended december  and  we recognized a gain of million and thousand  respectively  included in foreign exchange gain in the consolidated statements of income 
based upon a sensitivity analysis performed against our forward foreign exchange contracts at december  and  which measures the hypothetical change in the fair value of the contracts resulting from shift in the value of exchange rates of the indian rupee relative to the us dollar  a appreciation in the us dollar against the indian rupee and a corresponding increase in the value of the hedged assets would lead to a decrease in the fair value of our forward foreign exchange contracts by million and million  respectively 
conversely  a depreciation in the us dollar against the indian rupee would lead to an increase in the fair value of our forward foreign exchange contracts by million and million 
we regularly review our hedging strategies and may in the future  as a part of this review  determine the need to change our hedging activities 

table of contents during the year ending december  in connection with the acquisition of e z data the company issued a put option to the sellers  with respect to the shares of ebix common stock that were issued as part of the acquisition consideration  which is exercisable during the thirty day period immediately following the two year anniversary date of the business acquisition  which if exercised would enable them to sell the shares back to the company at a price of per share  which represents a discount off of the per share value established on the effective date of the closing of ebix s acquisition of e z data 
using a black scholes model we determined that the initial fair value for the put option was million and that its fair value on december  and had decreased by million and thousand  respectively 
the inputs used in the valuation of the put option include term  stock price volatility  current stock price  exercise price  and the risk free rate of return  with the volatility factor being the input subject to the most variation 
therefore  as pertaining to the put option  the company is exposed to market risk as regarding the rate and magnitude of change of our stock price and corresponding variances to the volatility factor used in the black scholes valuation model 
we evaluated this risk by estimating the potential adverse impact of a increase in the volatility factor and determined that such a change in the volatility factor would have resulted in an approximate thousand and thousand increase to the put option liability and a corresponding reduction to pre tax income as of and for the years ended december  and  respectively
