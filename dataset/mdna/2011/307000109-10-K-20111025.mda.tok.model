our fiscal year generally ends on the saturday closest to august of each year  which generally results in an extra week every six years 
fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were week years 
executive overview we operate a chain of more than  general merchandise retail discount stores in states  providing primarily low and middle income consumers with a selection of competitively priced merchandise in convenient neighborhood stores 
our merchandise assortment includes consumables  home products  apparel and accessories  and seasonal and electronics 
we sell merchandise at prices that generally range from less than to during fiscal as compared with fiscal  our net sales increased to billion  our net income increased to million  and our diluted net income per common share increased to 
comparable store sales stores open more than months for fiscal increased compared with fiscal our strong performance during fiscal was due primarily to our strong sales performance and an improvement in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  as a percentage of net sales 
several years ago  we slowed new store growth to focus on improving returns in existing stores and the chain overall 
we completed an end to end re engineering of our merchandising and supply chain processes  enhanced the performance of our store teams  refreshed our store technology platform  and created a store layout for new stores that is more convenient and easier to shop 
as a result of these investments  we have upgraded our operational capabilities  increased profitability  gained productivity and expanded our financial returns 
more importantly  these investments have provided us with a strong foundation to accelerate revenue growth 
in today s uncertain economic environment  value and convenience continues to resonate with consumers 
our strategy of providing customers with value and convenience continues to attract not only our core low income customers but also middle income families with greater frequency 
to continue to capitalize on this opportunity  we have launched several initiatives to enhance the customer s shopping experience and improve their perception of our value and convenience proposition 
during fiscal  we continued to focus on achieving our four corporate goals build customer loyalty and experience  develop diverse  high performing teams  deliver profitable sales growth  and drive continuous improvement 
these goals are designed to drive both short term and longer term financial results 
the following are some highlights from these efforts 
we accelerated our new store growth and increased our store openings by from fiscal to stores 
we renovated stores under our comprehensive store renovation program 
this program is intended to increase our competitiveness and sales productivity by transforming the customer s shopping experience in a family dollar store 
as a part of this program  we expanded key consumable 
table of contents categories and created more intuitive merchandise adjacencies  improved the navigational signage  leveraged new fixtures that enhance customer sightlines  increase capacity  and simplify restocking and recovery processes  created a warmer  more inviting shopping environment that includes a refresh of the building fa ade and exterior signage  raised store standards  improved store operating processes and leveraged technology to increase workforce productivity  and raised our customer service standards by strengthening our team member engagement with enhanced training  improved recognition programs and more consistent team member branding 
to respond to customer demand  provide our customers with more value and convenience  and increase productivity in all stores  we significantly expanded our merchandise assortment in both food and health and beauty aids in stores that were not renovated in fiscal  in addition to the stores we renovated 
our objective was to drive traffic with an expanded selection of consumables while also driving a larger basket with more impulse purchases and greater in store excitement 
in fiscal  we completed this expansion in more than  stores 
we made significant progress in increasing our penetration of private brands 
in fiscal  private brands sales increased by approximately over fiscal private brands consumable sales performed especially well  increasing by over fiscal in fiscal  private brands sales represented approximately of total sales and approximately of total consumable sales 
we launched an initiative designed to help us leverage our workforce more effectively  improve store level execution and increase workforce productivity 
through this effort  we re engineered many of our core store processes  including shelf re stocking  the check out experience  store recovery and in store merchandising 
through the application of new technology and processes  we implemented new time and attendance procedures  addressed workflow and task management  and improved store level execution 
this has allowed us to more effectively manage store labor  a significant portion of our core expenses 
fiscal outlook building on the improvements we made over the past several years  we plan to continue to execute on our initiatives designed to deliver profitable sales growth  accelerate new store openings  and strengthen our value and convenience proposition in fiscal our new store performance has improved significantly in the last several years as a result of the utilization of stronger site selection tools as well as enhancements driven by our strategic initiatives 
our operational improvements  combined with softening real estate markets and a growing customer base  have resulted in additional opportunities for new store growth 
during fiscal  we plan to open between and new stores  which we expect will achieve our goal of to square footage growth 
during fiscal  we plan to renovate  relocate or expand more than  stores 
building on the momentum of private brand growth in fiscal  we intend to increase our penetration of private brands even further in fiscal we expect to launch several new brands that will offer our customers more quality and value while also refreshing a few of our existing brands to broaden their appeal 
we intend to drive greater awareness of our private brand program through increased marketing and visual merchandising support 
to continue to deliver profitable sales  in fiscal we plan to continue to expand our global sourcing teams  develop stronger processes to help us integrate our sourcing activities with our category management efforts  and continue to expand our supplier network 
we expect these efforts will continue to increase our profitability and help to mitigate some margin pressures 
during fiscal  we expect net sales to grow due to the acceleration of our new store growth and an increase in comparable stores sales 
we expect comparable store sales to increase as a result of our current 
table of contents strategic initiatives  as well as continued benefits from operational improvements over the past several years 
we expect sales will continue to be strongest in the consumables category  as customers continue to constrain their discretionary spending in response to continued economic pressure 
we expect cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  will be approximately flat 
we expect that the adverse impact of stronger sales of lower margin consumables and higher freight costs will be mitigated by the expected benefits of private brands and global sourcing 
we expect sg a expenses to decrease as a percentage of net sales as a result of our comparable store sales growth and continued productivity improvements  which we expect will offset increased expense pressure from our aggressive investment agenda 
results of operations our results of operations for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal are highlighted in the table below and discussed in the following paragraphs years ended in thousands august  august  august  net sales cost and expenses cost of sales of net sales selling  general and administrative of net sales cost of sales and operating expenses of net sales operating profit of net sales investment income of net sales interest expense of net sales income before income taxes of net sales income taxes of net sales net income of net sales net sales net sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  and in fiscal compared to fiscal the net sales increases in fiscal and fiscal reflect increases in comparable store sales of and  respectively  with the balance of the increases due primarily to sales from new stores opened as part of our store growth program 
comparable store sales include stores that have been open more than months 
stores that have been renovated  relocated or expanded are included in the comparable store sales calculation to the extent that they had sales during comparable weeks in each year 
the method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry 
as a result  our comparable store sales calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
the increase in comparable store sales in fiscal resulted from increases in both customer traffic  as measured by the number of register transactions  and the dollar value of the average customer transaction 

table of contents during fiscal  the customer count increased approximately  and the average customer transaction increased approximately compared to fiscal sales during fiscal were strongest in the consumables category 
the increase in comparable store sales in fiscal resulted from an increase in customer traffic  as measured by the number of register transactions and an increase in the dollar value of the average customer transaction

cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  was in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal the increase in cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was a result of the impact of stronger sales in lower margin consumables merchandise and increased freight costs  partially offset by lower inventory shrinkage 
the impact of stronger sales of lower margin consumables was slightly offset by the effect of higher purchase mark ups in many categories 
we continue to focus on improving our purchase mark ups through our price management  the continued development of our private brand assortment  and our global sourcing efforts 
freight costs were negatively impacted by higher diesel costs 
we believe that inventory shrinkage benefited from workforce stabilization in our stores and improved analytics and monitoring processes 
the decrease in cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  was due primarily to lower inventory shrinkage  higher purchase mark ups  lower freight expense  and lower markdown expense  which more than offset increased sales of lower margin consumable merchandise 
we believe that inventory shrinkage benefited from higher store manager retention  lower levels of discretionary merchandise and improved analytics and monitoring processes 
we continued to focus on improving our purchase mark ups through our price management  the continued development of our private brand offering  and our global sourcing efforts 
freight expense benefited from improvements in inventory productivity  the impact of lower diesel costs on the first half of fiscal  and increased transportation productivity and efficiency 
markdown expense benefited from strong sales of seasonal merchandise  our continued focus on improving inventory productivity and managing inventory risk  and the absence of any markdown expense during fiscal for products containing lead phthalates 
we incurred approximately million of lead phthalate markdown expense during fiscal in connection with new product safety legislation 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses increased in fiscal  compared to fiscal  and in fiscal  compared to fiscal the increases in these expenses were due in part to additional sales volume and additional costs arising from the continued growth in the number of stores in operation 
sg a expenses  as a percentage of net sales  were in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal most expenses in fiscal were leveraged as a result of a increase in comparable store sales and continued productivity improvements 
the increased comparable store sales volumes helped offset our investments to drive revenue growth  including store renovations  extended store hours and enhanced marketing efforts 
in addition  sg a expenses  as a percentage of net sales  were leveraged as a result of lower non store payroll costs  including incentive compensation expense  approximately of net sales in fiscal  as compared to fiscal reflecting our pay for performance philosophy  incentive compensation costs decreased as a percentage of net sales as a result of our relative performance against our target in fiscal  as compared to fiscal 
table of contents most costs in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  including occupancy costs  were leveraged as a result of a increase in comparable store sales and continued productivity improvements 
as a percentage of net sales  decreases in insurance expense approximately of net sales and utility expense approximately of net sales more than offset an increase in store payroll expense approximately of net sales 
insurance expense continued to benefit from favorable trends in workers compensation and general liability costs  and our energy management efforts contributed to the decrease in utility expense 
the increase in store payroll expense was due primarily to the expansion of our store operating hours 
investment income investment income decreased million in fiscal  compared to fiscal  and million in fiscal  compared to fiscal the decreases in both years were primarily due to lower interest rates

we did not incur any interest expense during fiscal or fiscal related to the notes 
income taxes the effective tax rate was for fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal  as compared to fiscal was due primarily to an increase in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions and increases in valuation allowances  partially offset by an increase in federal jobs tax credits 
the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to a decrease in federal jobs tax credits  changes in state income taxes  and lower tax exempt interest income  offset partially by a decrease in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions 
liquidity and capital resources general we have consistently maintained a strong liquidity position 
cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal our operating cash flows are generally sufficient to fund our regular operating needs  capital expenditure program  cash dividend payments  share repurchases  interest payments  and debt maturities 
in fiscal  we completed an initial public debt offering to supplement operating cash flows to provide additional capital for our investment initiatives and share repurchase program 
we believe operating cash flows and existing credit facilities will provide sufficient liquidity for our ongoing operations  including our lease obligations and growth initiatives 
credit facilities on november   we entered into a new four year unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders for borrowings of up to million 
the credit facility matures on november   and provides for two  one year extensions that require lender consent

recent accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standard update asu fair value measurement amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss asu 
asu amends current fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to include increased transparency around valuation inputs and investment categorization 
the new guidance is effective for fiscal year and interim periods beginning after december  we will adopt this guidance in the third quarter of fiscal the adoption of asu is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu presentation of comprehensive income asu 
asu allows an entity to present components of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement  referred to as the statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate  but consecutive statements 
the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
while asu changes the presentation of comprehensive income  there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance 
the new guidance is effective for fiscal year and interim periods beginning after december  we will adopt this guidance in the third quarter of fiscal the adoption of asu is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management 
our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information  historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting principles are critical because they involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
merchandise inventories our inventories are valued using the retail method  based on retail prices less mark on percentages  which approximates the lower of first in  first out fifo cost or market 
we record adjustments to inventory through cost of sales when retail price reductions  or markdowns  are taken against on hand inventory 
in addition  
table of contents we make estimates and judgments regarding  among other things  initial markups  markdowns  future demand for specific product categories and market conditions  all of which can significantly impact inventory valuation 
these estimates and judgments are based on the application of a consistent methodology each period 
while we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for these components  if actual demand or market conditions are different than our projections  it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded estimates 
this risk is generally higher for seasonal merchandise than for non seasonal merchandise 
we estimate inventory losses for damaged  lost or stolen inventory inventory shrinkage for the period from the most recent physical inventory to the financial statement date 
the accrual for estimated inventory shrinkage was million as of the end of fiscal and million as of the end of fiscal the accrual for estimated inventory shrinkage is based on the trailing twelve month actual inventory shrinkage rate and can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of the physical inventory counts 
stores receive a physical inventory at least annually 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to the valuation of inventory during fiscal property and equipment we state property and equipment at cost 
we calculate depreciation for financial reporting purposes using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
for leasehold improvements  this depreciation is over the shorter of the term of the related lease generally five or ten years or the asset s useful economic life 
the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates 
we generally do not assign salvage value to property and equipment 
we review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
historically  our impairment losses on fixed assets  which typically relate to normal store closings  have not been material to our financial position and results of operations 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to the valuation and classification of property and equipment during fiscal see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on property and equipment 
insurance liabilities we are primarily self insured for health care  property loss  workers compensation  general liability  and auto liability costs 
these costs are significant primarily due to the large number of our retail locations and employees 
our self insurance liabilities are based on the total estimated costs of claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported  less amounts paid against such claims  and are not discounted 
we review current and historical claims data in developing our estimates 
we also use information provided by outside actuaries with respect to medical  workers compensation  general liability  and auto liability claims 
the insurance liabilities we record are mainly influenced by changes in payroll expense  sales  number of vehicles  and the frequency and severity of claims 
the estimates of more recent claims are more volatile and more likely to change than older claims 
if the underlying facts and circumstances of the claims change or the historical trend is not indicative of future trends  then we may be required to record additional expense or a reduction in expense  which could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations 
we record our liabilities for workers compensation  general liability and auto liability costs on a gross basis  and record a separate insurance asset for amounts recoverable under stop loss insurance policies on the consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  our gross liabilities and the related insurance asset are separated into current and non current amounts on the consolidated balance sheets 
our total liabilities for workers compensation  general liability and auto liability costs were million million current and million non current as of the end of fiscal  and million million current and million non current as of the end of fiscal the current portion of the liabilities is included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets  and the non current portion is included in other liabilities 
the insurance assets related to these amounts totaled million million current and 
table of contents million non current as of the end of fiscal  and million million current and million non current as of the end of fiscal the current portion of the assets is included in prepayments and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets  and the non current portion is included in other assets 
there were no other material estimates for insurance liabilities during fiscal or fiscal our insurance expense during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal was impacted by changes in our liabilities for workers compensation  general liability and auto liability costs 
see our discussion of sg a expenses under results of operations above for more information 
contingent income tax liabilities we are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business and we record contingent income tax liabilities related to our uncertain tax positions 
our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions require an assessment of the probability of the income tax related exposures and settlements and are influenced by our historical audit experiences with various state and federal taxing authorities as well as by current income tax trends 
if circumstances change  we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations 
our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions were million as of the end of fiscal  and million as of the end of fiscal there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine contingent income tax liabilities during fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on our contingent income tax liabilities 
contingent legal liabilities we are involved in numerous legal proceedings and claims 
our accruals  if any  related to these proceedings and claims are based on a determination of whether or not the loss is both probable and estimable 
we review outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss 
we re evaluate the claims and proceedings each quarter or as new and significant information becomes available  and we adjust or establish accruals  if necessary 
if circumstances change  we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations 
our total legal liabilities were not material as of the end of fiscal or fiscal there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine contingent legal liabilities during fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on our contingent legal liabilities 
stock based compensation expense we measure stock based compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date 
the determination of the fair value of our employee stock options on the grant date is calculated using a black scholes option pricing model and is affected by our stock price as well as by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
we also grant performance share rights and adjust compensation expense each quarter based on the ultimate number of shares expected to be issued 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions to measure stock based compensation in future periods  the compensation expense recorded may differ significantly from the amount recorded in the current period 
our results for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal include stock based compensation expense of million  million and million  respectively 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine stock based compensation during fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on stock based compensation

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing  investing and cash management activities 
we maintain unsecured revolving credit facilities at variable rates of interest to meet the short term needs of our expansion program and seasonal inventory increases 
during fiscal  we incurred an immaterial amount of interest expense related to our credit facilities 
we did not incur any interest expense related to our credit facilities in fiscal we are also subject to market risk from exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment securities 
our investment securities currently include auction rate securities that are subject to failed auctions and are not currently liquid 
as of august   we had a million unrealized loss million net of taxes related to these investments 
we believe that we will be able to liquidate our auction rate securities at par at some point in the future as a result of issuer calls or refinancings  repurchases by the broker dealers  or upon maturity 
however  volatility in the credit markets could continue to negatively impact the timing of future liquidity related to these investments and lead to additional adjustments to their carrying value
