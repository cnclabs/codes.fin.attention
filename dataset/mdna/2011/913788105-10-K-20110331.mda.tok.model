item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary our key operating results for include the following net sales for the year were slightly down by  while gross profit margin increased to from in net operating income was million in compared to net operating income of million in  the million increase was attributable primarily to settlement expenses of million and increase sales in the core business 
on a non gaap basis  after adjusting results for the settlement expenses  non gaap operating income for is higher than the comparable amount in the corresponding period 
see reconciliation of gaap operating income and income before provision for income taxes to non gaap operating income and income before provision for income taxes unaudited below 
inventory levels increased by million in to meet customer requirements in the first half of accounts receivable decreased by approximately million  accounts payable decreased by approximately million and our line of credit increased by million since end of year our net sales from batteries  related power accessories and other products increased to million from million for net sales from adt security services and its authorized dealers decreased to million  down compared to million for we believe this decrease is due to the changes within adt security services from tyco international s acquisition of broadview security systems 
we believe the decline in net sales in over reflects the change in consumer spending throughout the global economy 
in addition to taking steps to manage the difficult economic conditions  we are also focusing on developing higher margin products and markets and diversifying our markets to minimize our exposure to the broader economy 
we expanded our battery  charger and power accessory lines to better meet the evolving needs of our customers and ultimately  the end user 
we will continue to capitalize on favorable industry trends  such as the growing demand for productivity  mobility and portability in the consumer electronics industry 
we are diligently and cautiously evaluating markets and acquisition opportunities that facilitate reaching our strategic objectives 
we remain conservative on this front due to the economic climate 
however  we believe that the recession and the associated deterioration in stock values and market prices have created growth opportunities 
we believe that with our strong balance sheet and operations  we are positioned to take advantage of these opportunities 
we continue to make the necessary investments in our infrastructure  namely  our distribution facilities  our warehouse management system and our people  to support and facilitate our immediate and long term growth objectives 
reconciliation of gaap operating income and income before provision for income taxes to non gaap operating income and income before provision for income taxes unaudited the following table reconciles operating income and income before provision for income taxes  as reported in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principals gaap  to non gaap operating income and income before provision for income taxes 
we believe that non gaap operating income  which is generally operating income less costs related to settlement agreements  more accurately reflects our operating efficiency 
non gaap operating income and income before provision for income taxes are non gaap financial measures and should not be considered an alternative to  or more meaningful than  net income prepared on a gaap basis 
additionally  non gaap operating income and income before provision for income taxes may not be comparable to similar metrics used by others in our industry

in addition  acquisition could also affect our operating results in future periods

net sales from batteries and related power accessories increased million to approximately million in from million in  or 
net sales from adt security services and its authorized dealers  was million for compared to million in the period  a decrease of million  or 
we believe this decrease is due to the changes imposed by tyco international when it acquired broadview security systems 
cost of sales cost of sales is comprised of the base product cost  commissions to sourcing agents  freight  duty and servicing fees where applicable 
cost of sales totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million in the comparable period  a decrease of million  or 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased to in the period from for this cost decrease was attributable to reduced volatility on raw material costs and improved efficiencies across our supply chain  and a decrease in sales to adt security services and its authorized dealers 
our overall gross margin for the year ended december   was approximately compared to a gross margin of for the comparable period in settlement expenses in the first quarter of  we entered into a settlement agreement with our former chief executive officer relating to his resignation as an officer and director and we entered into an agreement with our former principal independent sourcing agent cancelling our relationship with such agent 
the total amount due under both agreements is million 
of this amount  million of the settlement with the sourcing agent was applied to an existing payable balance related to prior year inventory purchases  an aggregate of million was expensed as settlement expense in the first quarter of and an aggregate of million will be expensed as interest over the term of the agreements 
the payments due to the former chief executive officer are payable over a two year period  which began in january  and the payments to the former sourcing agent are due over a three year period which began in march except for the imputed interest expense  which will be amortized over the respective terms of the agreements  we do not expect to incur any additional costs in connection with these agreements 
operating expenses operating expenses for decreased approximately to approximately million from million for the decreased operating expenses of million in was attributable to there being no settlement costs for as described above  increases of million for facilities costs  million in personnel and related costs  and million in marketing and trade show costs  but offset by decreases of million in costs related to being a public company  of million bad debt expense  and million in other expenses such as insurance costs and legal fees 
operating income operating income for the year ended december  increased million  or  to approximately million compared to approximately million the comparable period in non gaap operating income for the period was million  a increase over the million from interest expense our interest expense totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  for the year ended december  the average outstanding loan balance on our line of credit was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily attributable to the repayment of zunicom notes in december liquidity we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million at december  and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities was million through december compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for the net cash used in operating activities during is due primarily to a decrease in accounts payable of approximately million  an increase of million in inventories  a decrease in accrued settlement accrual of million  and an increase in income tax receivable payable of million which is offset by net income of  non cash charges for depreciation  amortization  provision for bad debts and obsolete inventory  loss on disposal of property  deferred income taxes and stock based compensation expense of million  and a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million through december compared to million for the cash used during was primarily for purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities during was million compared to million used by financing activities for the net cash provided by financing activities for was due to million net change in our line of credit 
on december   we entered into a credit agreement with wells fargo to provide us with a new revolving credit facility 
the agreement with wells fargo provides that we may borrow up to million  with the possibility that we can increase the line to million if we can satisfy certain defined criteria 
all of our assets secure our obligations under the agreement 
our borrowing availability depends on our level of accounts receivable and inventory 
for each borrowing  we have the option to choose a base rate or eurodollar loan 
interest on base rate loans is payable quarterly and interest on eurodollar loans is generally payable monthly or quarterly as selected by the company 
the annual rate of interest payable on base rate and eurodollar loans fluctuate depending upon a number of factors  all as described in the agreement 
at december   the interest rate was 
the agreement terminates on july  the credit agreement contains customary negative covenants restricting our ability to take certain actions without wells fargo s consent  including incurring additional indebtedness  transferring or encumbering assets  paying dividends or making certain other payments  and acquiring other businesses 
if there is an event of default  including failure to pay  bankruptcy  breach of covenants and breach of representations and warranties  all amounts outstanding under the credit facility will become immediately due and payable 
the line s availability is based on a borrowing formula  which allows for borrowings equal to of our eligible accounts receivable and a percentage of eligible inventory 
in addition  we must maintain certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis 
upon closing of the new credit facility  we immediately borrowed million of which million was used to repay the amounts due to compass bank under our old credit facility and approximately million was used to settle the liability evidenced by the notes held by zunicom  inc those notes had an aggregate outstanding principal amount of million plus accrued and unpaid interest of  as zunicom is a related party  the gain on extinguishment of those notes resulted in gain net of income taxes being recorded as additional paid in capital 
at december   approximately million was outstanding under the line of credit and approximately million remained available for borrowings under the line of credit based on the borrowing formula 
as a result of the refinancing of our line of credit  the interest swap agreement we had entered into with compass bank in june  was terminated 
the swap agreement had locked in a fixed rate of on the first million outstanding under the line of credit  thus swapping the fixed rate for the current variable rate as calculated under the original loan agreement with compass bank through its maturity date of july  the interest rate swap was accounted for as an effective cash flow hedge and the unrealized gains or losses related to the change in fair value were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
as a result of the termination of the interest swap agreement  we discontinued hedge accounting on december  the de designation of cash flow hedges requires that the net derivative gain or loss related to the discontinued cash flow hedge should continue to be reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  unless it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two month period of time thereafter 
we continue to incur interest expense commensurate with our original  hedged risk  and there is currently no indication that interest payments on the hedged transaction would not continue 
therefore  the realized loss related to this derivative will not be recognized immediately and will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
these losses are reclassified into earnings over the contractual terms of the swap agreement starting as of december  capital resources at december   we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
we may enter into various commitments during if expansion opportunities arise 
we will disclose material items in press releases and other appropriate filings as they develop 
we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
international currency fluctuation the goods that we purchase from asia are subject to international currency fluctuations 
we do not believe that the fluctuation in currency presents a serious threat to its operations 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we are a distributor who purchases both finished goods and components from domestic and international suppliers 
we add value to products and components by packaging them in customer specified kits or tailor made units that are convenient for the customer to order and ship 
additionally  we have several customers that require specific battery pack assemblies 
we obtain batteries and components and reconfigure finished goods based upon customer specifications 
we refer to this process as battery pack assemblies 
we recognize sales of finished goods at the time the customer takes title to the product 
we sell products to several customers in bulk quantities 
we obtain the order from the customer and arrange for the delivery of the product directly from our vendor to the customer to reduce freight costs and wear and tear on the product from excessive handling 
we refer to these transactions as drop shipments because the product is shipped directly from our vendor to our customer 
revenues from drop shipment transactions are recognized on a gross basis at the time the customer takes title to the product 
income taxes our provision for income taxes and effective tax rates are calculated by legal entity and jurisdiction and are based on a number of factors  including our income tax planning strategies  differences between tax laws and accounting rules  statutory tax rates and credits  uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances 
we use significant judgment and estimates in evaluating our tax positions 
tax law and accounting rules often differ as to the timing and treatment of certain items of income and expense 
as a result  the tax rate reflected in our tax return our current tax rate is different from the tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
some of the differences are permanent  while other differences are temporary as they reverse over time 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities for any temporary differences between the assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and their respective tax bases 
we establish valuation allowances when we believe it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
changes in future taxable income  tax liabilities and our tax planning strategies may affect our effective tax rate  valuation allowances and the associated carrying value of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
at any one time  our tax returns for various tax years are subject to examination by us federal and state taxing jurisdictions 
we establish tax liabilities in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  also codified under asc asc clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for income tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under asc  the impact of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return must be recognized in the financial statements at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized in the financial statements unless it is more likely than not to be sustained 
we adjust these tax liabilities  as well as the related interest and penalties  based on the latest facts and circumstances  including recently published rulings  court cases and outcomes of tax audits 
to the extent  our actual tax liability differs from our established tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits  our effective tax rate may be materially impacted 
while it is often difficult to predict the outcome of  the timing of  or the tax treatment of any particular tax position or deduction  we believe that our tax balances reflect the more likely than not outcome of known tax contingencies 
accounts receivable trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount we expect to collect 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
management considers the following factors when determining the collectability of specific customer account customer credit worthiness  past transaction history with the customer  current economic industry trends and changes in customer payment terms 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  adversely affecting their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
based on management s assessment  we provide for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance 
balances that remains outstanding after we have used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable 
inventories inventories consist of finished goods  primarily of batteries and security products related to the company s third party fulfillment services and materials used in the assembly of batteries into packs 
all items are stated at the lower of cost  determined using the average cost method by specific item  or market 
the company performs periodic evaluations  based upon business trends  to identify specifically obsolete  slow moving and non salable inventory 
stock based compensation we account for stock options under accounting provisions that require the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation 
under these fair value recognition provisions  we estimate stock based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards expected to vest and recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
we have used the black scholes valuation model to estimate fair value of our stock based awards  which requires various judgmental assumptions  including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates and expected life 
our computation of expected volatility is based on a combination of historical and market based implied volatility 
in addition  we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures and expected life  including types of awards  employee class and historical experience 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period
