item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes appearing under item some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and expected financial results  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the risk factors under item a for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
business description we own and operate a network of full service agricultural and construction equipment stores in the united states 
based upon information provided to us by cnh global nv or its nv subsidiary cnh america llc  collectively referred to in this annual report as cnh  we are the world largest retail dealer of case ih agriculture equipment and a major retail dealer of new holland agriculture  case construction and new holland construction equipment in the us we operate our business through two reportable segments  agriculture and construction 
within each segment  we have four principal sources of revenue  new and used equipment sales  parts sales  service  and other business activities including equipment rental 
the agricultural equipment we sell and service includes machinery and attachments for uses ranging from large scale farming to home and garden use 
the construction equipment we sell and service includes heavy construction and light industrial machinery for commercial and residential construction  road and highway construction and mining applications 
we offer our customers a one stop solution for their equipment needs through new and used equipment sales  parts sales  repair and maintenance services  and equipment rental and other activities 
the new equipment and parts we sell are supplied primarily by cnh 
according to public reports filed by cnh  cnh is a leading manufacturer and supplier of agricultural and construction equipment based on the number of units sold  primarily through the case ih agriculture  new holland agriculture  case construction and new holland construction brands 
sales of new cnh products accounted for approximately of our new equipment revenue in fiscal  with no other supplier accounting for more than 
we acquire used equipment for resale through trade ins from our customers and selective purchases 
we sell parts and provide in store and on site repair and maintenance services 
we rent equipment and provide other ancillary services such as equipment transportation  gps signal subscriptions and finance and insurance products 
throughout our year operating history we have built an extensive  geographically contiguous network of stores  including two outlet stores  located in north dakota  south dakota  minnesota  iowa  nebraska  montana and wyoming 
we have a history of growth through acquisitions  including acquisitions consisting of stores operating in seven states since january  we expect that acquisitions will continue to be an important component of our growth 

table of contents certain external factors affecting our business we are subject to a number of factors that affect our business as discussed in the sections entitled risk factors and information regarding forward looking statements 
certain of the external factors include  but are not limited to  the following industry factors our business is primarily driven by the demand for agricultural equipment for use in the production of food  fiber  feed grain and renewable energy  home and garden applications  and the maintenance of commercial  residential and government properties 
based on usda data  we believe farmers have recently experienced historically strong economic fundamentals  driven by growing global demand for agricultural commodities in part due to growth in renewable energy and the economies of developing countries 
this strong farm economy contributed significantly to our results of operations in fiscal  and we believe our operating model  as discussed in business titan operating model  enables us to maximize opportunities and implement our conservative expenditure philosophy that emphasizes scalable costs 
further  our large and diverse customer base and seven state geographic footprint limits our exposure to negative events that may occur in a particular area or crop 
additionally  we believe that acquisition opportunities will continue to be strong 
our business is also impacted by the demand for construction equipment for use in private and government commercial  residential and infrastructure construction  demolition  maintenance  mining  energy and forestry operations 
cnh and industry reports show that demand for construction equipment in our markets is driven by several factors  one of which is public infrastructure spending  including roads and highways  sewer and water 
any growth in federal allocations to public infrastructure spending over the next few years should positively impact our future results of operations 
likewise  any decline in federal allocations to public infrastructure spending over the next few years should negatively impact our future results of operations 
to address the uncertainty of the construction industry  we expect to continue our focus on the agriculture industry and acquisition opportunities to establish additional locations in the markets where we believe the local construction industry will maintain its current level or grow 
seasonality our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuation due to varying weather patterns  which may impact the timing and amount of equipment purchases  rentals  and after sales parts and service purchases by our agriculture and construction customers 
economic cyclicality sales of agricultural equipment historically have fluctuated with general farm economic trends  primarily driven by farm cash receipts 
sales of construction equipment historically have fluctuated with general economic cycles 
during economic downturns  construction equipment retailers tend to experience similar periods of decline and recession as the general economy 
credit market changes changes in credit markets can affect our customers ability and willingness to make capital expenditures  including purchasing our equipment 
creditors tightened their lending standards following the collapse of the sub prime mortgage market and these conditions may still be continuing in some areas 
these tightened lending standards may have a negative impact on our business if our customers are unable to obtain financing for equipment purchases 
however  if retail interest rates remain low  our business may be positively affected by customers who find financing purchases of our equipment more attractive due to lower borrowing costs 
our business is also particularly dependent on our access 
table of contents to credit markets to finance acquisitions and manage inventory 
continued tightened lending standards may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms 
we cannot predict what future changes will occur in credit markets or how these changes will impact our business 
inflation inflation has not had a material impact upon operating results and we do not expect it to have such an impact in the future 
to date  in those instances in which we have experienced cost increases  we have been able to increase selling prices to offset such increases 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will not be affected by inflation or that we can continue to increase our selling prices to offset increased costs and remain competitive 
acquisitions we have a successful history of growth through acquisitions 
since january   we have completed acquisitions consisting of stores operating in seven states 
these acquisitions have been the most significant factor affecting our results of operations and liquidity over the last several years  as noted in the period to period comparisons below 
we expect that acquisitions will continue to be an important component of our growth 
acquisitions are typically financed with floorplan debt  long term debt and cash from operations 
although we cannot quantify the impact of any such potential acquisitions  we believe the nature of their impact on our financial statements to be similar to that experienced with our prior acquisitions as noted in our discussions of period comparisons 
the following is a summary of acquisitions completed during the identified periods

critical accounting policies and estimates during the preparation of our financial statements  we are required to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect reported amounts 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments include those related to bad debts and credit sales  inventories  goodwill and intangibles  income taxes and legal proceedings  revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  incentive plan accruals  deferred taxes  stock based compensation  and accounting for business combinations 
we update these estimates  assumptions and judgments as appropriate  which in most cases is at least quarterly 
we use our technical accounting knowledge  cumulative business experience  
table of contents judgment and other factors in the selection and application of our accounting policies 
while we believe the estimates  assumptions and judgments we use in preparing our financial statements are appropriate  they are subject to factors and uncertainties regarding their outcome and therefore  actual results may materially differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are our primary critical accounting policies and estimates 
revenue recognition revenue on equipment sales is recognized upon receipt of a signed contract and delivery of product to customers 
revenue on parts sales is recognized upon delivery of product to customers 
rental and service revenue is recognized at the time the related services are provided 
in addition to outright sales of new and used equipment  certain rental agreements may include rent to purchase options 
under these agreements  customers are given a period of time to exercise an option to purchase the related equipment  with a portion of the rental payments being applied to the purchase price 
any such equipment is included in inventory until the purchase option is exercised 
payments received during the rental period are recorded as customer deposits  with equipment sales revenue being recognized upon the exercise of the purchase option 
inventories new and used equipment are stated at the lower of cost specific identification or market value with adjustments for decreases in market value on inventory rented but available for sale being a percentage of the rental income received on such inventory 
all used equipment inventories and certain new equipment inventories  including that which has been rented  is subject to periodic lower of cost or market evaluation 
parts inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market value 
an estimate of parts inventories not expected to be sold in the next year has been reported separately  which is based on historical sales of parts on hand 
typically  there are no freight in charges  except in cases of special orders where such freight in charges are included in the cost of inventory 
work in process is valued at the retail rates of labor incurred and parts inventories used on service work in process at year end 
intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets with a finite life consist of customer relationships and covenants not to compete  and are carried at cost less accumulated amortization 
we amortize the cost of identified intangible assets on a straight line basis over the expected period of benefit  which is three years for customer relationships and the contractual term for covenants not to compete  which range from five to ten years 
in accordance with the guidance for impairment of long lived assets in asc property  plant  and equipment overall  we review intangible assets that have finite useful lives when an event occurs indicating the potential for earlier impairment 
we measure impairment losses related to long lived assets based on the amount by which the carrying amounts of these assets exceed their fair values 
we measure fair value under asc  which is generally based on the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows 
intangible assets with an indefinite life consist of distribution rights with manufacturers 
we classify distribution rights as indefinite lived intangible assets as our distribution agreements continue indefinitely by their terms  or are routinely awarded or renewed without substantial cost to us or material modifications to the underlying agreements 
as such  we believe that its distribution agreements will contribute to cash flows for an indefinite period  therefore the carrying amount of distribution rights is not amortized 
we test distribution rights for impairment annually  or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that its carrying amount is greater than its fair value 
the impairment test is performed by comparing the carrying value to its fair value 
fair value is calculated by discounting the estimated future cash flows of the respective store or 
table of contents group of stores associated with the business combination in which we obtained the distribution rights 
as of january   the carrying value of our distribution rights was not considered impaired 
goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of the assets of businesses acquired not allocable to separately identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill acquired in business combinations is assigned to its related reporting unit  which consist of our operating segments 
goodwill is not amortized  but is tested for impairment at the end of our fiscal year  or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that a reporting unit carrying amount of goodwill is greater than its fair value 
the goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value 
fair value is calculated by discounting the estimated future cash flows of our reporting units 
as of january   the carrying value of our goodwill was not considered impaired 
income taxes income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related primarily to differences between the basis of receivables  inventory  property and equipment  intangible assets  stock based compensation  and accrued expenses for financial and income tax reporting 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences  which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled 
our policy is to recognize interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters within our provision for income taxes 
we perform a comprehensive review of our portfolio of uncertain tax positions in accordance with the requirements and recognition standards established by financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  income taxes 
pursuant to this guidance  an uncertain tax position represents our expected treatment of a tax position taken  or expected to be taken  in a tax return  that has not been reflected in measuring income tax expense for financial reporting purposes 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of the asc  compensation stock compensation 
this guidance requires that stock based compensation  which includes stock options and restricted stock  be accounted for at the fair value of the applicable equity instrument 
business combinations we account for business combinations in accordance with the provisions of asc  business combinations 
this guidance allows the acquirer to finalize the acquisition accounting during the measurement period  which may not exceed one year from the date of acquisition 
during the measurement period the company accounting for the business combination transaction may be based on estimates due to various unknown factors present at the date of acquisition 
key financial metrics in addition to tracking our sales and expenses to evaluate our operational performance  we also monitor certain key financial metrics  including absorption and same store sales 
absorption absorption is an industry term that refers to the percentage of an equipment dealer fixed operating expense covered by the gross margin of its combined parts and service businesses 
absorption in a given period is calculated by dividing our gross profit from parts and service sales in the period by the difference between i our operating expenses including interest on floorplan notes and ii our 
table of contents variable expense of sales commissions on equipment sales and incentive compensation in the same period 
we believe that absorption is an important management metric because during economic down cycles our customers tend to postpone new and used equipment purchases while continuing to run  maintain and repair their existing equipment 
thus  operating at a high absorption rate enables us to operate profitably throughout economic down cycles 
we measure and track absorption on a company wide basis as well as on a per store basis 
our company wide absorption rate was  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
same store sales same store sales for any period represent sales by stores that were part of our company for the entire comparable period in the preceding fiscal year 
we do not distinguish relocated or newly expanded stores in this same store analysis 
closed stores are excluded from the same store analysis 
we believe that tracking this metric is important to evaluating the success of the titan operating model on a comparable basis 
key financial statement components revenue equipment 
we derive equipment revenue from the sale of new and used agricultural and construction equipment 
parts 
we derive parts revenue from the sale of parts for equipment that we sell  as well as for other equipment makes 
our parts sales provide us with a relatively stable revenue stream that is less sensitive to the economic cycles that affect our equipment sales 
services 
we derive services revenue from maintenance and repair services to our customers equipment 
our repair and maintenance services provide a high margin  relatively stable source of revenue through changing economic cycles 
other 
we derive other revenue from equipment rentals and ancillary equipment support activities such as equipment transportation  gps signal subscriptions and reselling finance and insurance products 
cost of revenue equipment 
cost of equipment revenue is the lower of the acquired cost or the market value of the specific piece of equipment sold 
parts 
cost of parts revenue is the lower of the acquired cost or the market value of the parts sold  based on average costing 
service 
cost of service revenue represents costs attributable to services provided for the maintenance and repair of customer owned equipment and equipment then on rent by customers 
other 
costs of other revenue represent costs associated with equipment rental  providing transportation  hauling  parts freight  gps subscriptions and damage waivers  including  among other items  drivers wages  fuel costs  shipping costs and our costs related to damage waiver policies 
operating expenses our operating expenses include sales and marketing expenses  sales commissions which generally are based upon equipment gross profit margins  payroll and related benefit costs  insurance expenses  
table of contents professional fees  property rental and related costs  property and other taxes  administrative overhead  and depreciation associated with property and equipment other than rental equipment 
floorplan interest the cost of financing inventory is an important factor affecting our results of operations 
floorplan financing from cnh capital and our credit agreement represent the primary sources of financing for equipment inventories 
cnh regularly offers interest free periods as well as additional incentives and special offers 
as of january   approximately of our floorplan notes payable was non interest bearing 
other interest expense interest expense represents the interest on our outstanding debt instruments  other than floorplan financing facilities 
results of operations comparative financial data for each of our four sources of revenue for fiscal   and are expressed below 
the results of these periods include the operating results of the acquisitions made during these periods 
the period to period comparisons included below are not necessarily indicative of future results

acquisitions contributed million of the increase in total gross profit  while same store sale gross profits provided the remaining million 
offsetting the positive effect to gross profits of higher revenue was compression on our equipment margins  which was caused by market pricing pressures throughout much of fiscal  but improved towards the end of the year due to increased market demand and an increase in the amount earned under manufacturer incentive programs  as compared to the prior year 
operating expenses fiscal year ended january  fiscal year ended january  increase percent change dollars in thousands operating expenses operating expenses as a percentage of revenue the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the additional costs associated with acquisitions  such as compensation  rent  and depreciation 
as a percentage of total revenue  operating expenses decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal due to improve fixed operating cost leverage resulting from higher revenues 

table of contents other income expense fiscal year ended january  fiscal year ended january  increase decrease percent change dollars in thousands interest and other income floorplan interest expense interest expense interest and other income for the years ended january  and were positively impacted by a manufacturer incentive earned in both years 
the increase in floorplan interest expense of million was due to the increase in floorplan notes payable balances as compared to fiscal  offset by reductions in interest rates 
we expect floorplan interest expense in fiscal to be positively impacted by lower interest rates associated with our new credit agreement entered into on october  provision for income taxes fiscal year ended january  fiscal year ended january  increase percent change dollars in thousands provision for income taxes our effective tax rate decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate from the prior year primarily reflects a decrease in the effect of permanent differences between financial and income tax reporting  such as incentive stock options  and reconciliation of differences between estimates used in our fiscal income tax accrual and actual amounts reported in our fiscal income tax return 
segment results fiscal year ended january  fiscal year ended january  increase decrease percent change dollars in thousands revenues agriculture construction segment revenues eliminations total income loss before income taxes agriculture construction segment income loss before income taxes shared resources eliminations income before income taxes 
table of contents agriculture agriculture revenues for fiscal increased compared to fiscal the revenue increase was primarily due to acquisitions and an agriculture same store sales increase of over fiscal the same store sales growth was primarily caused by increased farm cash receipts and favorable harvest conditions and crop yield reports across our footprint 
agriculture income before income tax increased in fiscal primarily due to higher revenues 
offsetting the positive effect to gross profits of higher revenue was compression on our equipment margins and higher floorplan interest expense  as compared to fiscal the compression on our equipment margins  which was caused by market pricing pressures throughout much of fiscal  improved towards the end of the year due to increased market demand and an increase in the amount earned under manufacturer incentive programs  as compared to the prior year 
floorplan interest expense increased due to increased floorplan notes payable balances  partially offset by lower interest rates  compared to fiscal we expect floorplan interest expense in fiscal to be positively impacted by lower interest rates associated with our new credit agreement entered into on october  construction fiscal construction revenues increased compared to fiscal the revenue increase was primarily due to new store openings and a construction same store sales increase of as compared to fiscal a major factor contributing to our increased revenue was the continued execution of our fiscal construction business action plan  which included changing key construction personnel and implementing the titan operating model in the construction stores acquired in fiscal loss before income taxes decreased primarily due to higher construction segment gross profits resulting from increased revenues  offset by higher interest expense resulting from increased long term debt associated with rental fleet  as compared to fiscal also contributing to the loss was million in exit costs related to the closing of our store in columbia falls  montana 
we expect interest expense in fiscal to be positively impacted by lower interest rates associated with our new credit agreement entered into on october  shared resources eliminations we incur centralized expenses income at our general corporate level  which we refer to as shared resources  and then allocate these net expenses to our segments 
since these allocations are set early in the year  unallocated balances may occur

the acquired stores contributed million in additional total revenue  while the same store sales growth contributed million  an increase of over the prior year 
the same store sales increase was driven by strong agriculture segment sales offset by declines in our construction segment

acquisitions contributed million of the increase in total gross profit  while same store sale gross profits provided the remaining million 
gross profit margins were for fiscal compared to for fiscal fiscal agriculture equipment margins were enhanced by a tight supply of equipment that did not recur in fiscal the return to more traditional supply conditions and inventory levels also resulted in increased equipment inventory valuation charges over the prior year 
fiscal also included a reduced manufacturer market share incentive payment as compared to the prior year 
the decrease in other margins was primarily due to a lower utilization of rental fleet that resulted from a weak fiscal construction industry 
operating expenses fiscal year ended january  fiscal year ended january  increase percent change dollars in thousands operating expenses operating expenses as a percentage of revenue the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the additional costs associated with acquisitions  such as compensation  rent  depreciation  travel and training 
as a percentage of total revenue  operating expenses increased slightly to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal this increase from the prior year was due to the increased number of stores in our construction segment  which have higher operating expenses as a percent of revenue  as well as lower revenues due to the challenging construction market  as compared to the same period of fiscal 
table of contents other income expense fiscal year ended january  fiscal year ended january  increase percent change dollars in thousands interest and other income floorplan interest expense interest expense interest and other income increased million as we received a manufacturer financing incentive in the fourth quarter of fiscal  offset by a decrease in interest income from investing our cash balances in highly secure investments in fiscal that carried lower interest rates than those earned in fiscal the increase in floorplan interest expense of million was due to the increase in floorplan notes payable balances as compared to fiscal  as well as increased interest rates

other indebtedness with cnh capital

the balances outstanding with agricredit are secured by the related inventory 
repayment terms vary by individual notes  but generally payments are made from sales proceeds or rental revenue from the related inventories 
sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash reserves  cash flow from operations  proceeds from the issuance of debt and borrowings under our credit facilities 
we expect that ongoing requirements for debt service and capital expenditures will be funded from these sources 

table of contents adequacy of capital resources our primary uses of cash have been to fund our strategic acquisitions  finance the purchase of inventory  meet debt service requirements and fund operating activities  working capital  payments due under building space operating leases and manufacturer floorplans payable 
the primary factors affecting our ability to generate cash and to meet existing  known or reasonably likely cash requirements are the timing and extent of acquisitions and our operating performance as impacted by i industry factors  ii competition  iii general economic conditions and iv other business factors as identified in item a risk factors 
for fiscal and  our cash expenditures on property and equipment were million and million  respectively  exclusive of acquisitions  transfers between equipment inventory and our designated rental fleet  and property and equipment purchased with long term debt 
excluding cash expenditures on rental fleet equipment  cash expenditures on property and equipment was million in fiscal we expect our property and equipment expenditures  exclusive of acquisitions  for fiscal to be approximately to million 
the actual amount of our fiscal equipment expenditures will depend upon factors such as general economic conditions  growth prospects for our industry and our acquisition activity 
we currently expect to finance equipment purchases with borrowings under the existing credit facilities  with available cash or with cash flow from operations 
we may need to incur additional debt if we pursue any future acquisitions 
our ability to service our debt will depend upon our ability to generate the necessary cash 
this will depend on our future acquisitions activity  operating performance  general economic conditions  and financial  competitive  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our immediate control 
based on our current operational performance  we believe our cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowings under the existing credit facilities will adequately provide our liquidity needs for  at a minimum  the next months 
we cannot assure you  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the credit facilities with the wells fargo bank syndicate and cnh capital in amounts sufficient to allow us to service our indebtedness and to meet our other commitments 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to obtain sufficient future borrowings  we may be required to seek one or more alternatives such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness  selling material assets or operations or seeking to raise additional debt or equity capital 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to succeed with one of these alternatives on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
in addition  if we pursue strategic acquisitions  we may require additional equity or debt financing to consummate the transactions  and we cannot assure you that we will succeed in obtaining this financing on favorable terms or at all 
if we incur additional indebtedness to finance any of these transactions  this may place increased demands on our cash flow from operations to service the resulting increased debt 
our existing debt agreements contain restrictive covenants that may restrict our ability to adopt any of these alternatives 
any non compliance by us under the terms of our debt agreements could result in an event of default which  if not cured  could result in the acceleration of our debt 
certain information concerning off balance sheet arrangements as of january   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we are  therefore  not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair value of financial instruments but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
we have both fixed and floating rate financing 
some of our floating rate credit facilities contain minimum rates of interest to be charged 
based upon balances and interest rates as of january   holding other variables constant  a one percentage point increase in interest rates for the next month period would decrease pre tax earnings and cash flow by approximately million 
conversely  a one percentage point decrease in interest rates for the next month period would result in an increase to pre tax earnings and cash flow of approximately million 
at january   we had variable rate floorplan notes payable of million  of which approximately million was interest bearing  variable notes payable and long term debt of million  and fixed rate notes payable and long term debt of million
