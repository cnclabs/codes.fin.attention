at december   we had total assets of billion  total loans of billion  total deposits of billion and shareholders equity of million 
while we recognized a net loss of million for  it was substantially improved compared to the prior two years  and we experienced three consecutive quarters of net income to end the weak local and national economic conditions that have persisted over the past few years contributed to the million and million of operating losses we reported during and and the million loss in the first quarter of the losses for each period were largely attributable to loan losses  lost interest on non performing assets and rising costs of administering problem assets associated with the rapid increase in problem loans and other real estate assets 
the results for also included a non cash charge of million included in federal income tax expense associated with the establishment of a valuation allowance f or deferred tax assets and the results for included non cash  after tax impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets of million 
there will be no further negative affect on our results of operations associated with deferred tax assets or goodwill  as these assets have been written off or reserved for in their entirety 
as a result of our losses  in  our board of directors significantly changed our strategic direction to focus on improving our internal operations and working out of our problem loans and assets 
the board of directors has implemented additional corporate governance practices and disciplined business and banking principles  including more conservative lending principles that comply with regulatory standards 
the focus of our management team turned from growth in our business to executing these disciplined business and banking procedures and policies designed to limit future losses  preserve capital and improve operational efficiencies 
in addition  the board of directors added experienced members during the year to provide further oversight and guidance to the company 
these efforts are reflected in the results for with lower levels of chargeoffs and provision for loan losses  reductions in operating expenses and reduction in balance sheet totals resulting in improvement in our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios 
as of the date of this report  the bank was categorized as adequately capitalized under applicable regulatory guidelines 
during the course of the audit procedures for  our independent registered accounting firm for the year ended december   crowe horwath llp  identified certain deficiencies in our credit administration and allowance for loan loss process that we and they determined constituted a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting at december  also at december   crowe horwath llp determined that there was substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
as discussed above and throughout this document  significant improvements in our processes and our financial results and financial condition occurred during the year ended december  we do not have substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern  and our independent public accounting firm for the year ended december   bdo usa llp  has issued an unqualified report on its audit of our financial statements as of and for the year ended december  in item of this report  and did not include a paragraph in its report expressing substantial doubt about the company ability to continue as a going concern 
we have determined that the improved controls instituted in response to the material weakness identified at december  have remediated the deficiencies and have concluded that there are no material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting at december  bdo usa llp has also issued an unqualified report on its audit of our internal control over financial reporting as of december  in item a of this report  which states that macatawa bank corporation maintained  in all material respects  effective internal control over financial reporting as of december  
table of contents we have also worked closely with our regulators at the frb  the fdic and the ofir to put in place improved controls and procedures 
on february   the bank entered into a consent order with the fdic and ofir  its primary banking regulators 
additional information further describing changes in our business  including those in response to our recent losses and to the consent order  are described in detail in item of this report in note of the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations summary net loss available to common shares was million or loss per common share for compared to net loss of million or loss per common share for the results for included the following a million gain on the sale of our investment securities portfolio in the second quarter and a  gain recognized on the sale of property in the fourth quarter that had been held for future expansion 
the results for included the following a non cash charge of million included in federal income tax expense associated with the establishment of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  a million charge associated with the settlement of the trade partners lawsuit  and a  industry wide special fdic assessment 
these items are discussed more fully below 
the overall improvement in financial results for compared to relate primarily to the performance of the loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses was million for compared to million for net chargeoffs of loans were down in at million compared to million in costs associated with nonperforming assets were million for compared to million for the increase in is primarily the result of losses and writedowns of other real estate owned 
lost interest from non performing assets was approximately million and million for and each of these items is discussed more fully below 
more information regarding the steps designed to limit future losses including complying with the requirements of the consent order may be found below in this item of the report under the headings noninterest expense and loan portfolio and asset quality  and in item of this report under the heading recent business developments 
net interest income net interest income totaled million during compared to million during the decrease in net interest income during compared to was due primarily to a million decrease in average earning assets partially offset by a basis point increase in net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets ie net interest margin or margin 
as is customary in the banking industry  interest income on tax exempt securities is adjusted in the computation of the yield on tax exempt securities and net interest margin using a tax rate to report these items on a fully taxable equivalent basis 
average interest earning assets decreased from billion to billion from a focus on reducing credit exposure within certain segments throughout  liquidity improvement and capital preservation 
the net interest margin increased to for from for reduced reversals of accrued interest on loans moving to nonaccrual status resulted in approximately basis points of the increase 
despite the negative impact of the sale of our securities portfolio in the second quarter of  our net interest margin has continued to improve during  from in the fourth quarter of to in the fourth quarter of the sale of the securities portfolio is discussed further in this item under the heading noninterest income 
the yield on earning assets decreased basis points to for from for the decline was from a decrease in the yield on our variable rate loan portfolio  an increase in the balance of lower yielding liquid investments and elevated average balances of non accrual loans 
the basis point decline in the prime rate that occurred during continued to cause a decrease in the yield on our variable rate loan portfolio in as loans continued to mature and reprice at lower interest rates 
we have chosen to hold excess investable funds in these lower yielding short term investments to improve our balance sheet liquidity during this period of challenging economic conditions 
the primary driver of our improvement in net interest margin for was a basis point decrease in our cost of funds from for to for average interest bearing liabilities decreased from billion in to billion in most of this decrease was in our highest costing sources of funds thereby accomplishing a favorable mix change in interest bearing liabilities 
the largest decrease was a million decrease in average balances of time deposits  decreasing the cost of funds for those deposits from in to in also impacting the reduction in cost of funds were reductions in the rates paid on other deposit and borrowing types in as compared to 
table of contents in  the level of earning assets is expected to continue to decline due to the persistent weak economic conditions in michigan 
the continued decline in the level of earning assets may have a further negative impact on net interest income in  however  we expect the pace of decline in balances to be reduced in a continued decline in the cost of funds  primarily from the repricing of term funding at lower costs  is expected to partially offset the impact of lower earning asset levels in the following table shows an analysis of net interest margin for the years ended december  and for the years ended december  dollars in thousands average balance interest earned or paid average yield or cost average balance interest earned or paid average yield or cost assets taxable securities tax exempt securities loans federal home loan bank stock federal funds sold and other short term investments total interest earning assets noninterest earning assets cash and due from banks other total assets liabilities and shareholders equity deposits interest bearing demand savings and money market accounts time deposits borrowings other borrowed funds long term debt subordinated debt federal funds purchased total interest bearing liabilities noninterest bearing liabilities noninterest bearing demand accounts other noninterest bearing liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity net interest income net interest spread net interest margin ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities yields are presented on a tax equivalent basis using a tax rate

the provision for loan losses was higher in as we responded to rapid declines in real estate values due to weakness in the economy 
our response required higher levels of charge offs which also led to a higher provision for loan losses 
net charge offs were million in and million in the higher level of charge offs have been mostly associated with significant declines in the value of collateral securing collateral dependent real estate loans primarily for residential land development 
we are starting to see signs of stabilization of values in these portfolio segments 
in response to these elevated loan losses and the need to comply with the requirements of the consent order  the board of directors has increased the governance over the lending function and  working directly with the management team  has taken steps to reduce our exposure within certain credit concentrations  establish more conservative lending principles that comply with regulatory standards and implement new lending and compliance procedures and policies and new problem loan identification and resolution plans 
more information regarding these steps may be found in this item of the report under the heading loan portfolio and asset quality 
the ultimate amount of the loan loss provision in all periods is a byproduct of establishing our allowance for loan losses at levels believed to be adequate under our methodology for determining the adequacy of the allowance 
more information about our allowance for loan losses and our methodology for establishing its level may be found in this item of the report under the heading allowance for loan losses below and in item of this report in note of the consolidated financial statements 
noninterest income noninterest income totaled million in compared to million in noninterest income for included million in gains on the sale of our investment securities portfolio and a  gain on the sale of a property we were holding for future expansion 
revenue from deposit services decreased  to million in compared to million in the decline in was related primarily to decreases in non sufficient fund fees  consistent with a decline across the entire banking industry 
net gains on mortgage loans included gains on the sale of real estate mortgage loans to the secondary market 
we sell the majority of the fixed rate mortgage loans we originate 
we do not retain the servicing rights for the loans we sell 

table of contents a summary of net gains on mortgage loans and related volume was as follows dollars in thousands for the year ended december net gains on sales of loans real estate mortgage loans originated for sale real estate mortgage loans sold net gain on the sale of real estate mortgage loans as a percent of real estate mortgage loans sold loan sales margin gains on sales of loans decreased  in to million compared to million in the low level of mortgage interest rates reached in the first quarter of and sustained throughout led to a higher level of refinancing in both periods 
this favorable rate environment for mortgage refinancing and our focus on shrinking our loan portfolio and preserving capital  are the primary reasons for the increase in loans originated for sale and the resulting level of gains on sales of loans for and the volume was also positively impacted by a governmental program providing tax credits for first time home buyers 
this program ended in early we recently added a new consumer loan manager  which we anticipate will positively impact our volume of mortgage and consumer loan activity 
along with this  as mortgage rates remain low at the end of  we anticipate continued elevated levels of mortgage banking income in the first part of trust service revenue declined  or  to million in from million in a challenging market for account growth and retention and general declines in customer stock portfolio values associated with the significant decline in the stock market during were the primary reasons for the decrease in trust income in each period 
our financial performance and the existence of the consent order may also be impacting how we are perceived in the marketplace  resulting in challenges to retain trust customers and maintain current levels of trust revenue 
atm and debit card processing income increased  in to million compared to million in the increase reflected a continued increase in usage from current customers and overall growth in the number of debit and atm card customers 
promotional efforts to increase volume in these low cost transaction alternatives continued to be successful 
during the second quarter of  the sale of our securities portfolio resulted in a gain of million 
we completed the disposition of nearly all of the municipal  corporate and us agency securities in our available for sale investment portfolio through sales in the open market 
these securities were comprised of approximately million in municipal securities with an average yield of and an average life of years  million in corporate securities with an average yield of and an average life of years  and million in us agency securities with an average yield of and an average life of years 
the sales were executed as part of our overall strategy to increase our regulatory capital ratios 
the majority of the proceeds have been initially invested in liquid money market balances with money center banks 
we intend to ultimately reinvest the proceeds in higher yielding investment securities when market conditions improve 
other income was million in compared to million in the amount for included a gain on the sale of a property that was held for future branch expansion 
this property was sold in the fourth quarter of for a gain  offsetting this was a decrease in earnings from bank owned life insurance boli which totaled  in compared to million in a death benefit was realized in causing higher boli income 
noninterest expense noninterest expense totaled million for compared to million for noninterest expense for included a million charge associated with the settlement of the trade partners lawsuit 
the trade partners settlement is further discussed in item of this report in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in note costs associated with nonperforming assets continues to remain elevated  increasing million in to million compared to million in these costs included legal costs  repossessed and foreclosed property administration expense and losses on repossessed and foreclosed properties 
repossessed and foreclosed property administration expense included survey and appraisal  property maintenance and management and other disposition and carrying costs 
losses on 
table of contents repossessed and foreclosed properties included both net losses on the sale of properties and unrealized losses from value declines for outstanding properties 
costs associated with nonperforming assets are itemized in the following table in thousands legal and professional repossessed and foreclosed property administration losses on repossessed and foreclosed properties total in response to the elevated problem asset levels  the related costs to administer these assets and the need to comply with the requirements of the consent order  the board of directors and management have taken tangible steps to reduce problem asset levels 
these steps are discussed further in this item under the heading loan portfolio and asset quality below and in item of this report in note of the consolidated financial statements 
because of these additional steps and as problems loans move through the collection process  these costs associated with nonperforming assets have remained elevated during and are expected to continue to be elevated in fdic assessments increased to million in compared to million in the fdic assessments were high as a result of increased assessment rates implemented by the fdic in late  including additional risk based assessments applicable to the bank 
the increase for included an industry wide special assessment of  we expect our fdic assessments for to remain high as a result of these increased assessment rates 
further discussion regarding the determination of fdic assessments for the bank may be found in item of this report under the heading supervision and regulation 
total noninterest expense was million in  compared to million in when excluding the trade partners litigation settlement charge in and the nonperforming asset costs and fdic assessments for each year  other non interest expense items were approximately million in compared to million in the steady decline in these other expense areas reflected our active management of controllable costs to offset the increases in nonperforming asset costs 
salaries and benefit expense decreased million  or  to million from million in due to our continued focus on operational efficiencies and continued curtailment of bonuses and wage increases in response to economic conditions 
we have continued to scale down our operations with the shrinkage in size of the bank and focus on a disciplined approach to our business 
staff reductions in the loan origination function are discussed more fully below under the heading loan portfolio and asset quality 
salaries and benefit expense are expected to remain stable in as a result of the initiatives taken in the past two years to right size our bank 
merit increases have again been suspended for occupancy expense declined  in following a decrease of  in furniture and equipment expense was down  in after a decrease of  in marketing and data processing expenses both declined slightly in and other expense was down million in both and the declines in and within these expense areas were the direct result of initiatives to reduce controllable costs  including the curtailment of certain growth activities as a result of the difficult economic conditions that have impacted our results 
in addition to eliminating or outsourcing certain backroom functions  these initiatives included restructuring third party contracts  acceleration of electronic delivery for certain customers and trimming controllable costs 
legal and professional fees increased  from  in to  in the increase was a result of additional professional time and effort with respect to regulatory filings and matters surrounding the consent order 
insurance costs for bond and directors and officers d o insurance increased significantly from  in to  in our costs increased as a result of increasing our coverage levels from and a higher rate per dollar of coverage charged due to the perceived increased risk by the insurance carrier of our coming under the consent order in we expect efficiency  excluding fdic assessments and the costs necessary to manage non performing assets  to continue to improve in as a result of our continued expense reduction initiatives 

table of contents federal income tax expense benefit we recorded federal income tax expense of million in and federal income tax benefit of million in we recorded income tax expense of million for primarily related to a reclassification from other comprehensive income for gains recognized in earnings associated with the sale of our investment securities 
a million tax benefit in  primarily associated with the million loss before income taxes  a portion of which was able to be carried back due to a tax law change  was offset by the need to establish an million valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance has been maintained on our deferred tax assets each reporting period since then 
the realization of deferred tax assets net of a recorded valuation allowance is largely dependent upon future taxable income  future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and the ability to carry back losses to available tax years 
in as sessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all positive and negative evidence  including taxable income in carry back years  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  expected future taxable income and tax planning strategies 
at december   our tax valuation allowance totaled million 
the valuation allowance may be reversed to income in future periods to the extent that the related deferred tax assets are realized or the valuation allowance is no longer required 
the realization of our deferred tax assets is largely dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income 
we returned to profitability in each of the last three quarters of and if we continue to generate consistent profitability  the need to maintain the valuation allowance will diminish 
we perform an analysis each quarter as to the need to maintain the valuation allowance 
during the fourth quarter of  a tax law change extended the carry back of and net operating losses to five years from the previous two year carry back period 
as a result we recorded an million favorable tax benefit that reduced our net operating loss for this carry back extension was only available to financial institutions  such as macatawa  that did not receive capital under the us treasury troubled asset relief program tarp 
this change allowed us to carry back and recover the full tax benefit of our net operating loss 
we received million in income tax refunds during as a result of this tax law change 
financial condition summary total assets were billion at december   a decrease of million from billion at december  the decrease in total assets was largely from a decline of million in our loan portfolio due to efforts to reduce concentration in certain loan types and improve on balance sheet liquidity 
part of the decline in the loan portfolio was from million of net loan charge offs primarily associated with valuation declines on collateral dependent real estate loans 
the reduction in assets since december  allowed us to reduce wholesale funding  including out of market deposits from brokers by million  and higher costing deposits 
total deposits were billion at december   down million  from billion at december  in addition to the decline in brokered deposits  local jumbo time deposits were down million 
total shareholders equity decreased by million primarily from the net loss recorded in the first quarter of each subsequent quarter resulted in positive earnings and increases in shareholders equity 
as a result of our losses in and and the resulting decline in our shareholders equity  the bank regulatory capital ratios fell below levels required to be categorized as well capitalized in as of the date of this report  the bank was categorized as adequately capitalized under applicable regulatory guidelines 
in addition  because the bank is subject to the consent order  the bank cannot be categorized as well capitalized  regardless of actual capital levels 
as a result  the bank cannot accept  renew or rollover any brokered deposit unless it has applied for and been granted a waiver of this prohibition by the fdic 
we intend to return the bank to well capitalized status and comply with the terms of the consent order through improved earnings  continued balance sheet management and capital raising efforts expected to be completed in cash and cash equivalents our cash and cash equivalents  which include federal funds sold and short term investments  were million at december  compared to million at december  the million increase was primarily the result of proceeds obtained from the sale of investment securities as described more fully in this item under the heading noninterest income as well as shrinkage in our loan portfolio 
we expect to maintain higher than normal balances of short term investments until conditions improve and more attractive investment opportunities emerge 
securities securities decreased million to million at december  from million at december  the balance at december  primarily consisted of us treasury securities held for collateral purposes 
as discussed above  the decrease was primarily associated with the sale of million of securities available for sale 
as 
table of contents conditions improve  we expect to reinvest excess liquidity and selectively rebuild our investment portfolio to diversify our asset concentrations 
loan portfolio and asset quality in response to the losses we have incurred and the need to comply with the requirements of the consent order  our board of directors has increased governance over the lending function and has taken tangible steps to reduce our loan portfolio  including our exposure within certain credit concentrations 
more discussion regarding these steps may be found in item of this report in note of the consolidated financial statements 
in order to comply with the requirements of the consent order  we expect to continue to shrink our loan portfolio in  but at a slower pace than experienced in our total loan portfolio decreased million to billion at december  from billion at december  during  our commercial and industrial loans decreased million  commercial real estate loans declined million and consumer loans decreased million 
our consumer residential mortgage loan portfolio  which also includes residential construction loans made to individual homeowners  comprised approximately of portfolio loans at the end of and  respectively 
however  a large portion of the origination volume of these types of loans is sold on the secondary market with servicing released 
while we have seen a million decline in our consumer residential mortgage portfolio  the volume of activity in this segment remained relatively strong during much of the decline in the residential mortgage portfolio was from customers refinancing and our subsequent sale of these loans in the secondary market 
our focus on shrinking our loan portfolio and preserving capital were the primary reasons for the reduction in these loans in mortgage loans originated for sale were million in compared to million in and million in mortgage interest rates declined in the first half of  as the government responded to weak economic conditions through efforts to stimulate the residential home market 
accordingly  we experienced a significant increase in refinancing activity 
as refinancing activity slowed and underwriting in the secondary markets became more stringent  volumes generally declined over the remainder of and rates remained low during and we saw an increase in volumes in the latter part of we have not yet been required to repurchase any loans sold  however  due to market conditions many banks are being required to repurchase loans due to actual or alleged failure to strictly conform to the purchaser purchase criteria 
our portfolio of other consumer loans includes loans secured by personal property and home equity fixed term and line of credit loans 
these types of loans decreased to million at december  from million at december  and comprised approximately of our portfolio loans at the end of and the decline in the commercial loan portfolio during and reflected the continuing weak economic conditions in west michigan and efforts to reduce our exposure within certain credit concentrations 
we focused our efforts throughout and on reducing our exposure to residential land development loans which were the source of most of our loan losses since  thereby diversifying our commercial loan portfolio and improving asset quality 
we have made good progress with this and we expect continued shrinkage in in our real estate portfolios 
total commercial loans  consisting of commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans  were million at december  and billion at december  this portfolio remains our largest loan segment and accounted for approximately of the total loan portfolio at both december  and our commercial loan portfolio is made up of loans to small and mid sized business 
our commercial and industrial loan portfolio decreased by million to million at december  and represented of our commercial portfolio 
the decrease was primarily from a general decline in business activity resulting from the soft economy 
the commercial real estate loan portfolio declined by million  primarily in construction and land development loans  due to charge offs and substantial effort to reduce exposure in these segments 

table of contents a further breakdown of the composition of the commercial loan portfolio is shown in the table below in thousands december  december  residential developed unsecured to residential developers vacant and unimproved commercial development residential improved commercial improved manufacturing and industrial total commercial real estate loans commercial and industrial total commercial loans of the decline in commercial real estate  million was from loans to residential developers  the portfolio that has caused the majority of stress within our loan portfolio 
loans to residential developers involved in the development or sale of family residential properties were approximately million and million at december  and as we entered  we were focused on efforts to continue to reduce the commercial loan portfolio in order to improve our asset quality  reduce concentrations in certain loan types  maintain or improve our capital ratios and comply with the bank consent order 
initiatives intended to achieve these results are described in more detail in item of this report in note of the consolidated financial statements and included the following downsized the loan origination team  including termination of loan officers whose loan portfolios included a majority of our non performing assets 
curtailed the origination of residential land development loans  the portfolio primarily responsible for loan losses in and established goals for the reduction of credit concentrations in the broader commercial real estate portfolio and implemented reporting requirements for accountability 
established individual lender scorecards which are monitored on an ongoing basis 
lenders are apprised monthly of these targets scorecards and held accountable 
in response to the elevated levels of nonperforming assets and loans classified substandard or worse  and the need to comply with the requirements of the consent order  our board of directors took the following steps to stabilize and reduce our problem asset levels 
realigned departments in the lending function in late the special asset group responsible for the disposition of problem assets and the credit administration department responsible for loan policy and credit monitoring are led by recently appointed senior officers who now report directly to the audit committee 
the risk management department also reports directly to the audit committee 
the risk management department is now administratively responsible for the loan review function and has expanded this team with senior loan review specialists to support its goal of completing an independent review of the entire commercial loan portfolio by march  certain loan officers whose loan portfolios included a majority of the our non performing assets were terminated 
in addition  the special assets group has set specific objectives and targets for the reduction in nonperforming asset levels 
to accomplish these reductions  the special assets group has been pursuing various strategies 
these strategies include the use of troubled debt restructures for viable businesses  attachment of additional collateral where possible  active communication and workout plans with loan customers under stress and accelerated disposition strategies for certain loan types and foreclosed assets 
we made significant progress during in these efforts as demonstrated by the decrease in nonperforming loan and delinquency levels as well as the substantial decrease in net chargeoffs incurred during when reasonable doubt exists concerning collectability of interest or principal of one of our loans  that loan is considered impaired and placed in nonaccrual status 
any interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed and charged against current earnings 
nonperforming assets are comprised of nonperforming loans  foreclosed assets and repossessed assets 

table of contents nonperforming loans include loans on non accrual status and loans delinquent more than days but still accruing 
foreclosed and repossessed assets include assets acquired in settlement of loans 
nonperforming loans as of december  totaled million or of total portfolio loans compared to million or of total portfolio loans at december  nonperforming loans at the end of and were primarily on nonaccrual and were considered to be either well collateralized or adequately reserved 
nonperforming loans for the development or sale of family residential properties were approximately million or of total non performing loans at december  compared to million or of total non performing loans at december  the remaining balance of non performing loans at december  consisted of million of commercial real estate loans secured by non residential real estate  million of commercial and industrial loans  and million of consumer and residential mortgage loans 
foreclosed assets totaled million at december  compared to million at december  the increase was the result of the migration of non performing loans secured by real estate into foreclosed assets through the foreclosure process 
of the million  there were commercial real estate properties totaling million 
the remaining balance was comprised of residential real estate properties totaling million 
all properties acquired through or in lieu of foreclosure are initially transferred at their fair value less costs to sell and then evaluated for impairment after transfer using a lower of cost or market approach 
proceeds from sales of foreclosed properties were million  million and million for  and the higher level of success in in disposing of foreclosed properties can be attributed to the concentrated efforts of the special assets group  the specific goal setting of this group and the application of additional resources during to accomplish these specific goals 
total nonperforming assets amounted to million or of total assets at december  compared to million or as of december  the following table shows the composition and amount of our nonperforming assets
