item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding our results of operations and our financial condition 
our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 
statements in this discussion may be forward looking 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed 
see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements at the beginning of this report and risk factors in item a for additional discussion of some of these factors and risks 
overview approach resources inc is an independent energy company engaged in the exploration  development  production and acquisition of oil and gas properties 
we focus on oil and natural gas reserves in oil shale and tight sands 
our management and technical team has a proven track record of finding and developing reservoirs through advanced completion  fracturing and drilling techniques 
our core properties are primarily located in the permian basin in west texas clearfork  wolfcamp shale  canyon sands  strawn and ellenburger 
we also own interests in the east texas basin cotton valley sands and cotton valley lime and in the chama basin in northern new mexico mancos shale 
as the operator of all of our estimated proved reserves and production  we have a high degree of control over capital expenditures and other operating matters 
at december   we had estimated proved oil and gas reserves of mmboe 
important characteristics of our proved reserves at december   include oil and ngls and natural gas  proved developed  operated  reserve life of over years based on production of mmboe  standardized after tax measure of discounted future net cash flows standardized measure of million  and pv of million 
pv is our estimate of the present value of future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves after deducting estimated production and ad valorem taxes  future capital costs and operating expenses  but before deducting any estimates for future income taxes 
estimated future net revenues are discounted at an annual rate of to determine their present value 
pv is a non gaap  financial measure and generally differs from the standardized measure  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  because it does not include the effects of income taxes on future cash flows 
pv should not be considered as an alternative to the standardized measure as computed under gaap 
see item properties proved oil and gas reserves for a reconciliation of pv to the standardized measure 
over of our proved reserves and production at december   were located in the permian basin in crockett and schleicher counties  texas  where we owned working interests in producing oil and gas wells 
at december   we leased approximately  net acres in the permian basin 
no proved reserves had been recorded for our wolffork oil shale resource play in the permian basin as of december  in addition to our producing wells  we had an estimated  potential drilling locations in the permian basin at december   of which were proved 
we also had an estimated potential wolffork recompletion opportunities in the permian basin  none of which were proved 
we owned working interests in nine producing gas wells in the east texas basin  and have identified proved drilling locations in the east texas basin at december  activity during  we drilled a total of gross net wells in the permian basin with a success rate 
production for totaled  mboe mboe d  compared to  mboe mboe d in  a increase 
our costs incurred in totaled million  and included million for exploration and 
table of contents development drilling  million  net of purchase price adjustments  for the purchase of an additional working interest in cinco terry and million for acreage acquisitions in the permian basin 
additional highlights for include wolffork oil shale resource play we were founded in to explore and develop unconventional oil and gas reservoirs at a competitive cost structure 
in  we began to assemble underdeveloped acreage in the permian basin and began a drilling program targeting the canyon sands  strawn and ellenburger formations in  net acres 
since  we have drilled approximately wells in the permian basin and  as of march   we leased approximately  net acres in the permian basin 
for a majority of our wells  we collected more log data  including mud logs that help identify hydrocarbon bearing formations  than  based on our operating experience in the area  we believe is typical for the area where we operate 
the log data indicated that hydrocarbons were present in the clearfork and wolfcamp shale formations above the canyon sands  strawn and ellenburger zones 
in october  we announced our wolffork oil shale resource play 
we performed a detailed geological and petrophysical evaluation using extensive regional mapping  d seismic data from over  acres  whole core data and well data from over wellbores that we have drilled and completed while targeting the canyon sands  strawn and ellenburger zones at depths of  to  feet 
the wolffork is composed of three stacked pay zones  the clearfork  dean and wolfcamp shale formations  totaling more than  feet of potential gross pay 
we believe that the wolffork oil shale resource play will significantly enhance our opportunities in the permian basin  and we plan to continue our pilot program targeting the wolffork in with a combination of vertical  horizontal and recompletion projects 
acquisition of acreage we acquired approximately  gross  net acres in the permian basin in crockett and schleicher counties  texas  during the acreage acquisitions joined our legacy asset in the southeast part of project pangea  ozona northeast  to cinco terry  in the northwest part of project pangea 
acquisition of working interest in october  we acquired a working interest in cinco terry from a non operating partner for million  net of purchase price adjustments  which was funded with borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we believe the acquisition of additional interests in cinco terry increases our opportunities in this area and enhances our leverage to the reserve potential of the wolffork oil shale resource play 
proved reserve and production growth in  our estimated proved reserves increased  or mmboe  to mmboe from mmboe  and our production increased to mboe d 
planned processing upgrades contributed to the increase in proved reserves at year end on april   we will begin realizing ngl revenues from the liquids rich gas stream in ozona northeast under a gas purchase and processing contract with dcp midstream  lp 
see item business markets and customers 
development drilling and planned processing upgrades in cinco terry  the acquisition of an additional working interest in cinco terry and improved pricing also contributed to the increase in proved reserves at december  the increase in production is attributable to our drilling program in the permian basin during on average  we operated three rigs in  and drilled a total of gross net wells  with a success rate 
balanced reserve profile our proved reserve profile at year end was oil and ngls and natural gas  compared to oil and ngls and natural gas at year end during  our proved oil and ngl reserves increased over  or mmbbls  to mmbbls from mmbbls in our increase in proved oil and ngl reserves is primarily due to planned processing upgrades in ozona northeast 
on april   we will begin realizing ngl revenues from the liquids rich gas stream in ozona northeast 

table of contents equity offering in november  we completed an equity offering and issued an aggregate of million shares of our common stock at per share in an underwritten public offering the offering 
after deducting underwriting discounts and transaction costs of approximately million  we received net proceeds of approximately million  which we intend to use to fund our capital expenditures for the wolffork oil shale resource play  working interest and leasehold acquisitions in the permian basin and general working capital needs 
pending these uses  we used a portion of the proceeds of the offering to repay all outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
additional working interest acquisition in february  we acquired a working interest in cinco terry from two non operating partners for million  subject to usual and customary post closing adjustments the working interest acquisition 
the working interest acquisition was funded with cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
as a result of the working interest acquisition  our working and net revenue interests in cinco terry are now approximately and  respectively 
our results of operations do not include production  revenues or costs from the working interest acquisition 
further  our year end estimated proved reserves  pv and standardized measure do not include estimated proved reserves associated with the working interest acquisition 
plans for in november  we announced a capital budget of approximately million 
in january  we acquired approximately  contiguous  net acres approximately nine miles west of our existing acreage in northeast crockett county  texas 
in addition  in march  we announced the working interest acquisition for million 
given our recent activity  in march we increased our capital budget to million  of which approximately million will be allocated to drilling and recompletion projects in the permian basin and approximately million will be allocated to the working interest acquisition and lease extensions  renewals and lease acquisitions in the permian basin 
the drilling program includes operating one rig to drill gross net horizontal wells targeting the wolfcamp shale  one rig to drill gross net vertical wells targeting the wolffork and canyon sands  one rig to drill gross net vertical wells targeting the canyon sands which we expect to recomplete in the wolffork in and one workover rig to recomplete gross net wells in the wolffork 
our objectives for the drilling program include delineating the clearfork and wolfcamp shale zones across project pangea  improving initial production rates by refining our stimulation strategy  advancing our understanding of optimal well spacing and hydrocarbon recovery and improving our cost structure 
our capital budget is subject to change depending upon a number of factors  including additional data on our wolffork oil shale resource play  results of wolfcamp shale and wolffork drilling and recompletions  economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling  prevailing and anticipated prices for oil  gas and ngls  the availability of sufficient capital resources for drilling prospects  our financial results and the availability of lease extensions and renewals on reasonable terms 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets  liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves 
some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements  some of which are subject to alternative treatments under gaap 
we also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents segment reporting is not applicable to us as we have a single  company wide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than by discrete operating segments 
we track only basic operational data by area 
we do not maintain complete separate financial statement information by area 
we measure financial performance as a single enterprise and not on an area by area basis 
we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
successful efforts method of accounting accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special  unique rules 
we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
the significant principles for this method are geological and geophysical evaluation costs are expensed as incurred  dry holes for exploratory wells are expensed  and dry holes for development wells are capitalized  and capitalized costs related to proved oil and gas properties  including wells and related equipment and facilities  are evaluated for impairment based on an analysis of undiscounted future net cash flows in accordance with asc if undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the net capitalized costs related to proved properties  then we recognize an impairment charge in income from operations equal to the difference between the net capitalized costs related to proved properties and their estimated fair values based on the present value of the related future net cash flows 
we noted no impairment of our proved properties based on our analysis for the years ended december   or proved reserves on december   the sec released a final rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting the final rule  approving revisions designed to modernize oil and gas reserve reporting requirements 
the final rule became effective for our financial statements for the year ended december   and our year end proved reserve estimates 
the most significant revisions to the reporting requirements included commodity prices 
economic producibility of reserves is based on the unweighted  arithmetic average of the closing price on the first day of the month for the month period prior to fiscal year end  unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements 
undeveloped oil and gas reserves 
reserves may be classified as proved undeveloped for undrilled areas beyond one offsetting drilling unit from a producing well if there is reasonable certainty that the quantities will be recovered 
reliable technology 
the final rule permits the use of new technologies to establish the reasonable certainty of proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserves volumes 
unproved reserves 
probable and possible reserves may be disclosed separately on a voluntary basis 
preparation of reserves estimates 
disclosure is required regarding the internal controls used to assure objectivity in the reserves estimation process and the qualifications of the technical person primarily responsible for preparing reserves estimates 
third party reports 
we are required to file the report of any third party used to prepare or audit reserves our estimates 
in addition  in january  the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update  oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures the update to provide consistency with the new reserve rules 
the update amends existing standards to align the reserves calculation and disclosure requirements under gaap with the requirements in the sec s reserve rules 
we adopted the new standards effective december  for the year ended december   we engaged degolyer and macnaughton  independent petroleum engineers  to prepare independent estimates of the extent and value of the proved reserves associated with certain of our oil and gas properties in accordance with guidelines established by the sec  including the final rule 

table of contents estimates of proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates including depletion  depreciation and amortization expense  evaluation of impairment of properties and the calculation of plugging and abandonment liabilities 
proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods and government regulations 
the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for any reservoir may change substantially over time due to results from operational activity 
proved reserve volumes at december   were estimated based on the average of the closing price on the first day of each month for the month period prior to december   for oil  natural gas and ngls in accordance with the final rule 
changes in commodity prices and operations costs may increase or decrease estimates of proved oil  ngl and natural gas reserves 
depletion expense for our oil and gas properties is determined using our estimates of proved oil  ngl and natural gas reserves 
a hypothetical decline in our december   estimated proved reserves would have increased our depletion expense by approximately  for the year ended december  see also item properties proved oil and gas reserves and note to our consolidated financial statements in this report for additional information regarding our estimated proved reserves 
derivative instruments and commodity derivative activities unrealized gains and losses  at fair value  are included on our consolidated balance sheets as current or non current assets or liabilities based on the anticipated timing of cash settlements under the related contracts 
changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative contracts are recorded in earnings as they occur and included in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
we estimate the fair values of swap contracts based on the present value of the difference in exchange quoted forward price curves and contractual settlement prices multiplied by notional quantities 
we internally valued the option contracts using industry standard option pricing models and observable market inputs 
we use our internal valuations to determine the fair values of the contracts that are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
realized gains and losses are also included in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties on our commodity derivatives positions and have considered the exposure in our internal valuations 
however  we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties over the term of the commodity derivatives positions 
changes in the derivative s fair value are currently recognized in the statement of operations unless specific commodity derivative hedge accounting criteria are met and such strategies are designated 
for qualifying cash flow commodity derivatives  the gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income to the extent the commodity derivative is effective 
the ineffective portion of the commodity derivative is recognized immediately in the statement of operations 
gains and losses on commodity derivative instruments included in accumulated other comprehensive income are reclassified to oil and gas sales revenue in the period that the related production is delivered 
derivative contracts that do not qualify for commodity derivative accounting treatment are recorded as derivative assets and liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet  and the associated unrealized gains and losses are recorded as current income or expense in the statement of operations 
historically  we have not designated our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges 
we record our open derivative instruments at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as either unrealized gains or losses on commodity derivatives 
we record changes in such fair value in earnings on our consolidated statements of operations under the caption entitled unrealized gain loss on commodity derivatives 
although we have not designated our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges  we use those instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices related to our oil and gas production 
accordingly  we record realized gains and losses under those instruments in other revenues on our consolidated statements of operations 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized an unrealized gain of  and million  respectively  from the change in the fair value of commodity derivatives 
for the year ended december   we recognized an unrealized loss of million from the 
table of contents change in the fair value of commodity derivatives 
a hypothetical increase in the nymex floating prices would have resulted in a million decrease in the december   fair value recorded on our balance sheet  and a corresponding increase to the loss on commodity derivatives in our statement of operations 
asset retirement obligation our asset retirement obligation primarily represents the estimated present value of the amount we will incur to plug  abandon and remediate our producing properties at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable federal  state and local laws 
we determine our asset retirement obligation by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to the liability 
the retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of the asset s inception  with an offsetting increase to proved properties 
periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded as an expense in the income statement 
our liability is determined using significant assumptions  including current estimates of plugging and abandonment costs  annual inflation of these costs  the productive lives of wells and our risk adjusted interest rate 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligation 
impairment of long lived assets all of our long lived assets are monitored for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may be greater than its future net cash flows 
the evaluations involve a significant amount of judgment since the results are based on estimated future events  such as future sales prices for oil  gas and ngls  future costs to produce these products  estimates of future oil and natural gas reserves to be recovered and the timing thereof  the economic and regulatory climates and other factors 
the need to test an asset for impairment may result from significant declines in commodity prices or downward revisions to estimated quantities of oil and gas reserves 
any assets held for sale are reviewed for impairment when we approve the plan to sell 
estimates of anticipated sales prices are highly judgmental and subject to material revision in future periods 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these factors  we cannot predict when or if future impairment charges will be recorded 
based on the review of the recoverability of the carrying value of our unproved properties in our boomerang project in southwest kentucky  we determined that we may not be able to recover costs associated with this project  and therefore have recorded impairment expense of million  related to all of our remaining carrying costs in this project 
at december   we had no estimated proved reserves recorded for boomerang 
acreage amounts in this report exclude boomerang 
valuation of share based compensation our plan allows grants of stock and options to employees and outside directors 
granting of awards may increase our general and administrative expenses subject to the size and timing of the grants 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we measure and record compensation expense for all share based payment awards to employees and outside directors based on estimated grant date fair values 
compensation costs for awards granted are recognized over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value 
there were no stock option grants during the years ended december  and the fair value of each option granted during the year ended december   was estimated using an option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions 
expected dividends expected volatility risk free interest rate expected life years we have not paid out dividends historically  thus the dividend yields are estimated at zero percent 

table of contents since our shares were not publicly traded prior to our initial public offering on november   we used an average of historical volatility rates based upon other companies within our industry 
management believes that these average historical volatility rates were the best available indicator of expected volatility 
the risk free interest rate is the implied yield available for zero coupon us government issues with a remaining term of five years 
the expected lives of our options are determined based on the term of the option using the simplified method outlined in staff accounting bulletin assumptions are reviewed each time there is a new grant and may be impacted by actual fluctuation in our stock price  movements in market interest rates and option terms 
the use of different assumptions produces a different fair value for the options granted or modified and impacts the amount of compensation expense recognized on the consolidated statement of operations 
effects of inflation inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended december   or although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent years  it is still a factor in the united states economy and may increase the cost to acquire or replace property  plant and equipment 
it may also increase the cost of labor or supplies 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth summary information regarding natural gas  oil and ngl revenues  production  average product prices and average production costs and expenses for the last three years

oil  ngl and gas sales 
oil  ngl and gas sales increased million  or  in to million from million in of the million increase in oil  ngl and gas sales in  approximately million was attributable to an increase in prices we received for our natural gas  oil and ngl production  and approximately million was attributable to an increase in production volumes 
in  the average price we received for our production  before the effect of commodity derivatives  increased to per boe from per boe  or a increase 
subject to commodity prices  we expect oil  ngl and gas sales to increase in due to increased production volumes from our drilling program in the permian basin  the working interest acquisition and realization of ngl revenues in ozona northeast 

table of contents oil  ngl and gas sales decreased million  or  in to million from million in the decrease in oil  ngl and gas sales principally resulted from sharp decreases in the price we received for our natural gas  oil and ngl production 
the average price we received for our production  before the effect of commodity derivatives  decreased to per boe from per boe  or a decrease 
of the million decrease in oil  ngl and gas sales  approximately million was attributable to a decrease in oil  ngl and gas prices  partially offset by million in oil  ngl and gas sales attributable to a slight increase in production volumes over the prior year

the unrealized gain on commodity derivatives was  and million for and  respectively  and the unrealized loss on commodity derivatives was million for as natural gas commodity prices increase or decrease  the fair value of the open portion of those positions decreases or increases 
the unrealized loss for primarily resulted from the settlement of derivative contracts which were outstanding at december  historically  we have not designated our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges

our lease operating expense loe for was million per boe  compared to million per boe for the increase in loe per boe over the prior year period was primarily due to an increase in water hauling and insurance and ad valorem taxes  partially offset by a decrease in compressor rental and repair over the prior year period 
compressor related expenses declined due to the release of a rental amine plant during the second half of and lower negotiated compressor rentals 
ad valorem taxes and water hauling  insurance and other loe increased as a result of an increase in the number of wells from our continued development in the permian basin 
for  we expect loe per boe to be relatively consistent despite higher service costs  which we expect will be partially offset by increased production volumes 
loe increased  or  for to million per boe from million per boe for increases in ad valorem taxes and pumpers and supervision costs were partially offset by decreases in well repair and maintenance and workover costs

we also recorded million of exploration expense for exploration expense for resulted from one dry hole drilled in ozona northeast and  of lease extensions in ozona northeast 
impairment of unproved properties 
we review our long lived assets to be held and used  including proved and unproved oil and gas properties accounted for under the successful efforts method of accounting 
as a result of this review of the recoverability of the carrying value of our assets  we recorded an impairment of unproved oil and gas properties of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the impairment resulted from a write off of million in costs in our boomerang project  and represented the remaining carrying value we had recorded for the project 
the impairment resulted from a write off of million in costs in northeast british columbia  and represented the remaining carrying value we had recorded for the project 
the impairment resulted from a write off of million of drilling costs incurred for three test wells in our boomerang project and related to the drilling and completion of three wells in our northeast british columbia project 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses g a increased  or  to million per boe for  from million per boe for the increase in g a was principally due to higher share based compensation  salaries and benefits

our interest expense  net  increased  or  to million for  from million for this increase was the result of higher average notes payable balances outstanding as well as an increase in amortization of  for deferred loan costs during the weighted average interest rate applicable to our outstanding borrowings during and  was and  respectively 

table of contents our interest expense increased  or  to million for from million for this increase was substantially the result of our higher average debt level during the weighted average interest rate applicable to our outstanding borrowings during and  was and  respectively 
income taxes 
our income taxes increased million to million for  from a benefit of  for the increase in income taxes was due to higher pre tax income in  partially offset by higher taxes in from a change in our estimated income tax provision for the year ended december  our effective income tax rate for was  compared with for the lower effective tax rate in the period primarily resulted from an increased impact of permanent differences from book and taxable income  partially offset by an increase in our estimated income taxes for the year ended december  our income taxes decreased to a benefit of  for compared with expense of million for our effective income tax rate for was  compared with for the decrease in the effective rate resulted primarily from a change in our estimated income tax expenses for  along with an increased impact of permanent differences between book and taxable income and increased effective state income tax rates 
liquidity and capital resources we generally will rely on cash generated from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and  to the extent that credit and capital market conditions will allow  future public equity and debt offerings to satisfy our liquidity needs 
our ability to fund planned capital expenditures and to make acquisitions depends upon our future operating performance  availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and more broadly  on the availability of equity and debt financing  which is affected by prevailing economic conditions in our industry and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we cannot predict whether additional liquidity from equity or debt financings beyond our revolving credit facility will be available on acceptable terms  or at all  in the foreseeable future 
our cash flow from operations is driven by commodity prices  production volumes and the effect of commodity derivatives 
prices for oil and gas are affected by national and international economic and political environments  national and global supply and demand for hydrocarbons  seasonal influences of weather and other factors beyond our control 
cash flows from operations are primarily used to fund exploration and development of our oil and gas properties 
we believe we have adequate liquidity from cash generated from operations and unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility for current working capital needs and maintenance of our current drilling program 
however  we may determine to access the public or private equity or debt markets for future development of reserves  acquisitions  additional working capital or other liquidity needs  if such financing is available on acceptable terms 
we cannot guarantee that such financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
liquidity we define liquidity as funds available under our revolving credit facility plus year end net cash and cash equivalents 
at december   we had no long term debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility  compared to million and million in long term debt outstanding at december  and  respectively 
the following table summarizes our liquidity position at december   and in thousands 
year ended december  borrowing base cash and cash equivalents long term debt unused letters of credit liquidity 
table of contents in november  we issued million shares of common stock at per share in the offering 
after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated transaction costs of approximately million  we received net proceeds of approximately million  which we intend to use to fund our capital expenditures for the development of our wolffork oil shale resource play  working interest and leasehold acquisitions in the permian basin and general working capital needs 
pending these uses  we used a portion of the proceeds of the offering to repay all outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in  while commodity prices were low and demand for natural gas was reduced  we decreased our capital spending in order to preserve our liquidity and improve our financial position 
as a result  we paid down our long term debt and increased our liquidity by over  from million at december   to million at december  in february  we acquired an additional working interest in cinco terry from two non operating partners for million 
the working interest acquisition was funded with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and cash on hand  which will materially decrease liquidity available to us in and beyond 
after giving effect to the financing of the working interest acquisition  we had approximately million in outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility at february  we believe we have adequate liquidity from cash generated from operations and unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility for current working capital needs and maintenance of our current drilling program 
however  we may determine to access the public or private equity or debt markets for future development of reserves  acquisitions  additional working capital or other liquidity needs  if such financing is available on acceptable terms 
we cannot guarantee that such financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
working capital our working capital is affected primarily by our cash and cash equivalents balance and our capital spending program 
at december   we had a working capital surplus of million as compared to a working capital deficit of million and a working capital surplus of million at december  and  respectively 
the surplus for was largely caused by the increase in our cash balance 
as a result of the working interest acquisition and our planned capital expenditure budget for  we expect to operate and end the year with a working capital deficit 
our working capital deficits have been historically attributable to accrued liabilities and have been more than offset by liquidity available under our revolving credit facility 
to the extent we operate or end the year with a working capital deficit  we expect such deficit to be more than offset by liquidity available under our revolving credit facility 
cash flows the following table summarizes our sources and uses of funds for the periods noted in thousands 
year ended december  cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows used in investing activities cash flows provided by used in financing activities effect of canadian exchange rate net decrease in cash and cash equivalents for  our primary sources of cash were from operating activities and the offering 
approximately million of cash from operations was used to fund a portion of our drilling program and pay down our long term debt 
in the offering  we sold  shares of common stock 
after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated transaction costs of approximately million  we received net proceeds of approximately million 
we intend to use proceeds from the offering to fund our capital expenditures for the development of our wolffork oil shale resource play  working interest and leasehold acquisitions in the permian basin and general working capital needs 
pending these uses  we used a portion of the proceeds of the offering to repay all outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

table of contents in  our primary sources of cash were from operating activities 
approximately million of cash from operations was used to fund our drilling program and d seismic operations and pay down our long term debt 
in  our primary sources of cash were from financing and operating activities 
approximately million from borrowings net of payments under our revolving credit facility and million cash from operations were used to fund our drilling program and the acquisition of a working interest below the top of the strawn formation and rights to miles of gathering system in ozona northeast 
operating activities during  our cash flows from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and available cash were used primarily for drilling activities in cinco terry and ozona northeast  leasehold acquisitions and a d seismic program in our permian basin operations 
cash flows from operating activities increased by  or million  to million from partially due to a increase in oil and gas sales in cash flows provided by operating activities also were affected by an increase in cash flows used by working capital during for  our cash flow from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and available cash were used for drilling activities  d seismic operations and for the payment of a portion of our long term debt 
the million in cash flows generated in the period decreased million from the same period in due primarily to a million decline in oil and gas sales  partially offset by a million decrease in working capital components and a net increase of million in other cash income and expense items 
for  our cash flow from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and available cash were used for drilling activities 
the million in cash flow generated during period increased by million from due primarily to an increase in oil  ngl and gas sales and a decrease in general and administrative expenses 
partially offsetting the increase in oil  ngl and gas sales and decrease in general administrative expenses was a reduction in working capital and an increase in loe and production taxes in the period compared to the period 
investing activities cash flows used in investing activities increased by million for as compared to  which primarily reflects expenditures for drilling and acquisitions in our core operating area in the permian basin 
during  we drilled a total of gross net wells  compared to gross net wells in also in  we acquired a working interest in cinco terry from a non operating partner for million  net of purchase price adjustments 
cash flows used in investing activities decreased by million in as compared to  which primarily reflects reduced expenditures for drilling and development of our oil and gas properties 
we substantially decreased our drilling activity in as a result of low commodity prices and to preserve liquidity 
we drilled gross net wells in in  we drilled or participated in gross net wells 

table of contents the majority of our cash flows used in investing activities for the years ended  and have been used for drilling and acquisitions in our core operating area in the permian basin and east texas basin 
the following table is a summary of capital expenditures related to our oil and gas properties in thousands 
years ended december  permian basin permian basin acquisitions subtotal east texas basin exploratory projects inventory lease acquisition  geological  geophysical and other total financing activities we borrowed million under our revolving credit facility in compared to million in and million in we repaid a total of million  million and million of amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility for  and  respectively 
in the offering  we issued million shares of common stock at per share in an underwritten public offering 
after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated transaction costs of approximately million  we received net proceeds of approximately million  which we intend to use to fund our capital expenditures for the development of our wolffork oil shale resource play  working interest and leasehold acquisitions in the permian basin and general working capital needs 
pending these uses  we used a portion of the proceeds of the offering to repay all outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our current goal is to manage our borrowings to help us maintain financial flexibility and liquidity  and to avoid the problems associated with highly leveraged companies with large interest costs and possible debt reductions restricting ongoing operations 
we believe we have adequate liquidity from cash generated from operations and unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility for current working capital needs and maintenance of our current drilling program 
however  we may determine to access the public or private equity or debt markets for future development of reserves  acquisitions  additional working capital or other liquidity needs  if such financing is available on acceptable terms 
we cannot guarantee that such financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
capital expenditures in november  we announced a capital budget of million 
in january  we acquired approximately  contiguous  net acres approximately nine miles west of our existing acreage in northeast crockett county  texas 
in addition  in february  we acquired the remaining working interest in cinco terry from two non operating partners for approximately million 
given our recent activity  in march we increased our capital budget to million  of which million is allocated to drilling and recompletion projects in the permian basin and approximately million will be allocated to lease extensions and renewals in the permian basin as well as the recent acreage and working interest acquisition 
our capital budget is subject to change depending upon a number of factors  including additional data on our wolffork oil shale resource play  results of wolfcamp shale and wolffork drilling and recompletions  economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling  prevailing and anticipated prices for oil  gas and ngls  the availability of sufficient capital resources for drilling prospects  our financial results and the availability of lease extensions and renewals on reasonable terms 

table of contents revolving credit facility we have a million revolving credit facility with a borrowing base set at million 
the borrowing base is redetermined semi annually on or before each april and october based on our oil and gas reserves 
we or the lenders can each request one additional borrowing base redetermination each calendar year 
currently  the maturity date under our revolving credit facility is july  borrowings bear interest based on the agent bank s prime rate plus an applicable margin ranging from to  or the sum of the eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin ranging from to 
margins vary based on the borrowings outstanding compared to the borrowing base 
in addition  we pay an annual commitment of of non used borrowings available under our revolving credit facility 
we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility at december  we had outstanding unused letters of credit under our revolving credit facility totaling  at december   which reduce amounts available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
loans under our revolving credit facility are secured by first priority liens on substantially all of our west texas assets and are guaranteed by our subsidiaries 
at february   we had million in outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility  with a weighted average interest rate of 
covenants our credit agreement contains two principal financial covenants a consolidated modified current ratio covenant that requires us to maintain a ratio of not less than to at all times 
the consolidated modified current ratio is calculated by dividing consolidated current assets as defined in the credit agreement by consolidated current liabilities as defined in the credit agreement 
as defined more specifically in the credit agreement  the consolidated modified current ratio is calculated as current assets less current unrealized gains on commodity derivatives plus the available borrowing base at the respective balance sheet date  divided by current liabilities less current unrealized losses on commodity derivatives at the respective balance sheet date 
a consolidated funded debt to consolidated ebitdax ratio covenant that requires us to maintain a ratio of not more than to at the end of each fiscal quarter 
the consolidated funded debt to consolidated ebitdax ratio is calculated by dividing consolidated funded debt as defined in the credit agreement by consolidated ebitdax as defined in the credit agreement 
as defined more specifically in the credit agreement  consolidated ebitdax is calculated as net income loss  plus exploration expense  depletion  depreciation and amortization expense  share based compensation expense  unrealized loss on commodity derivatives  interest expense  income and franchise taxes and certain other non cash expenses  less gains or losses from sales or dispositions of assets  unrealized gain on commodity derivatives and extraordinary or non recurring gains 
for purposes of calculating this ratio  consolidated ebitdax for a fiscal quarter is annualized pursuant to the credit agreement 
our credit agreement also restricts cash dividends and other restricted payments  transactions with affiliates  incurrence of other debt  consolidations and mergers  the level of operating leases  assets sales  investments in other entities and liens on properties 
in addition  our credit agreement contains customary events of default that would permit our lenders to accelerate the debt under our credit agreement if not cured within applicable grace periods  including  among others  failure to make payments of principal or interest when due  materially incorrect representations and warranties  failure to make mandatory prepayments in the event of borrowing base deficiencies  breach of covenants  defaults upon other obligations in excess of  events of bankruptcy  the occurrence of one or more unstayed judgments in excess of  not covered by an acceptable policy of insurance  failure to pay any obligation in excess of  owed under any derivatives transaction or in any amount if the obligation under the derivatives transaction is secured by collateral under the credit agreement  any event of default by the company occurs under any agreement entered into in connection with a derivatives transaction  
table of contents liens securing the loans under the credit agreement cease to be in place  a change in control as more specifically defined in the credit agreement of the company occurs  and dissolution of the company 
at december   we were in compliance with all of our covenants and had not committed any acts of default under the credit agreement 
to date we have experienced no disruptions in our ability to access our revolving credit facility 
however  our lenders have substantial ability to reduce our borrowing base on the basis of subjective factors  including the loan collateral value that each lender  in its discretion and using the methodology  assumptions and discount rates as such lender customarily uses in evaluating oil and gas properties  assigns to our properties 
contractual obligations as of december   our contractual obligations consisted of daywork drilling contracts  operating lease obligations  asset retirement obligations and employment agreements with our executive officers 
we periodically enter into contractual arrangements under which we are committed to expend funds to drill wells in the future  including agreements to secure drilling rig services  which require us to make future minimum payments to the rig operators 
we record drilling commitments in the periods in which well capital expenditures are incurred or rig services are provided 
our commitment under daywork drilling contracts was million at december  in april  we signed a five year lease for approximately  square feet of office space in fort worth  texas 
in august  we expanded our office space under an amendment to the lease to approximately  square feet 
in december  we expanded our office space under an amendment to the lease to approximately  square feet 
in january  we began rent payments of approximately  per month  bringing our total office lease payment to approximately  per month 
our asset retirement obligation primarily represents the estimated present value of the amount we will incur to plug  abandon and remediate our producing properties at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable federal  state and local laws 
we determine our asset retirement obligation by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to the liability 
the retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of the asset s inception  with an offsetting increase to proved properties 
periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded as an expense in the income statement 
at december   we had outstanding employment agreements with two of our executive officers that contained automatic renewal provisions providing that such agreements may be automatically renewed for successive terms of one year unless the employment is terminated at the end of the term by written notice given to the employee not less than days prior to the end of such term 
our maximum commitment under the employment agreements  which would apply if the employees covered by these agreements were each terminated without cause  was approximately  at december  the following table summarizes these commitments as of december  in thousands 
payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years daywork drilling contracts operating lease obligations asset retirement obligations employment agreements with executive officers total at december   daywork drilling contracts related to two drilling rigs were contracted through march   and june   respectively 
in march  we renewed a daywork drilling contract for a third rig through august at a rate of  per day 
operating lease obligations are for office space and equipment 

table of contents see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our asset retirement obligations 
as of january   we had entered into amended and restated or new employment agreements  each with two year initial terms  with five executive officers 
we estimate that our maximum commitment under these employment agreements  which would apply if the employees covered by these agreements were all terminated without cause  was approximately million as of the date of this report 
this estimate assumes the maximum potential bonus for is earned by each employee during with no prorated amounts due to partial year of service 
off balance sheet arrangements from time to time  we enter into off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to off balance sheet obligations 
as of december   the off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that we have entered into include undrawn letters of credit  operating lease agreements and gas transportation commitments 
we do not believe that these arrangements are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or availability of  or requirements for  capital resources 
general trends and outlook our financial results depend upon many factors  particularly the price of oil and gas 
commodity prices are affected by changes in market demand  which is impacted by overall economic activity  weather  pipeline capacity constraints  estimates of inventory storage levels  gas price differentials and other factors 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict future oil and gas prices  and therefore  we cannot determine what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program  production volumes and future revenues 
a substantial or extended decline in oil and gas prices could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  quantities of oil and gas reserves that may be economically produced and liquidity that may be accessed through our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility and through capital markets 
in addition to production volumes and commodity prices  finding and developing sufficient amounts of oil and gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our long term success 
future finding and development costs are subject to changes in the industry  including the costs of acquiring  drilling and completing our projects 
we focus our efforts on increasing oil and gas reserves and production while controlling costs at a level that is appropriate for long term operations 
our future cash flow from operations will depend on our ability to manage our overall cost structure 
like all oil and gas production companies  we face the challenge of natural production declines 
oil and gas production from a given well naturally decreases over time 
additionally  our reserves have a rapid initial decline 
we attempt to overcome this natural decline by drilling to develop and identify additional reserves  farm ins or other joint drilling ventures  and by acquisitions 
however  during times of severe price declines  we may from time to time reduce current capital expenditures and curtail drilling operations in order to preserve liquidity 
a material reduction in capital expenditures and drilling activities could materially reduce our production volumes and revenues and increase future expected costs necessary to develop existing reserves 
we also face the challenge of financing exploration  development and future acquisitions 
we believe we have adequate liquidity from cash generated from operations and unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility for current working capital needs and maintenance of our current drilling program 
however  we may determine to access the public or private equity or debt markets for future development of reserves  acquisitions  additional working capital or other liquidity needs  if such financing is available on acceptable terms 
we cannot guarantee that such financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk some of the information below contains forward looking statements 
the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices  and other related factors 
the disclosure is not meant to be a precise indicator of expected future losses  but rather an indicator of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information 
table of contents provides an indicator of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for commodity derivative and investment purposes  not for trading purposes 
proved reserves estimates of proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates including depletion  depreciation and amortization expense  evaluation of impairment of properties and the calculation of plugging and abandonment liabilities 
proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for any reservoir may change substantially over time due to results from operational activity 
proved reserve volumes at december   were estimated based on the average of the closing price on the first day of each month for the month period prior to december   for natural gas  oil and ngls in accordance with sec rules 
changes in commodity prices and operations costs may increase or decrease estimates of proved oil  ngl and natural gas reserves 
depletion expense for our oil and gas properties is determined using our estimates of proved oil  ngl and natural gas reserves 
a hypothetical decline in our december   estimated proved reserves would have increased our depletion expense by approximately  for the year ended december  commodity price risk given the current economic outlook  we expect commodity prices to remain volatile 
even modest decreases in commodity prices can materially affect our revenues and cash flow 
in addition  if commodity prices remain suppressed for a significant amount of time  we could be required under successful efforts accounting rules to perform a write down of our oil and gas properties 
we enter into financial swaps to reduce the risk of commodity price fluctuations 
we do not designate such instruments as cash flow hedges 
accordingly  we record open commodity derivative positions on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value and recognize changes in such fair values as income expense on our consolidated statements of operations as they occur 
at december   we had the following commodity derivative positions outstanding volume mmbtu mmbtu period monthly total fixed nymex henry hub price swaps price call waha basis differential basis swaps at december  and december   the fair value of our open derivative contracts was a net liability of approximately million and million  respectively 
jpmorgan chase bank  national association and keybank national association are currently the only counterparties to our commodity derivatives positions 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on our commodity derivatives positions 
however  we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties over the term of the commodity derivatives positions 
jpmorgan is the administrative agent and a participant  and keybank is the documentation agent and a participant  in our revolving credit facility and the collateral for the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility is used as collateral for our commodity derivatives 
unrealized gains and losses  at fair value  are included on our consolidated balance sheets as current or non current assets or liabilities based on the anticipated timing of cash settlements under the related contracts 
changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative contracts are recorded in earnings as they occur and 
table of contents included in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
we estimate the fair values of swap contracts based on the present value of the difference in exchange quoted forward price curves and contractual settlement prices multiplied by notional quantities 
we internally valued the option contracts using industry standard option pricing models and observable market inputs 
we use our internal valuations to determine the fair values of the contracts that are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
realized gains and losses are also included in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
for the year ended december  and  we recognized an unrealized gain of  and million  respectively  from the change in the fair value of commodity derivatives 
for the year ended december   we recognized an unrealized loss of million from the change in the fair value of commodity derivatives 
a hypothetical increase in the nymex floating prices would have resulted in a million decrease in the december   fair value recorded on our balance sheet  and a corresponding increase to the loss on commodity derivatives in our statement of operations 
to estimate the fair value of our commodity derivatives positions  we use market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique 
these inputs can be readily observable  market corroborated or generally unobservable 
we primarily apply the market approach for recurring fair value measurements and attempt to use the best available information 
we determine the fair value based upon the hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurement and lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurement 
the three levels of fair value hierarchy are as follows level quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date 
at december   we had no level measurements 
level pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date 
level includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies 
these models are primarily industry standard models that consider various assumptions  including quoted forward prices for commodities  time value  volatility factors and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments  as well as other relevant economic measures 
our derivatives  which consist primarily of commodity swaps and collars  are valued using commodity market data which is derived by combining raw inputs and quantitative models and processes to generate forward curves 
where observable inputs are available  directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the asset or liability  the instrument is categorized in level at december   all of our commodity derivatives were valued using level measurements 
level pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources 
these inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management s best estimate of fair value 
at december   our level measurements were used to calculate our asset retirement obligation and our impairment analysis of proved properties at december
