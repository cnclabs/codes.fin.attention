item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including  but not limited to  those presented under risks related to our business included in item a and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a leader in the distribution of avocados  prepared avocado products  and other perishable food products throughout the united states 
our history and expertise in handling california grown avocados has allowed us to develop a reputation of delivering quality products  at competitive prices  while providing competitive returns to our growers 
this reputation has enabled us to expand our product offerings to include avocados sourced on an international basis  prepared avocado products  and other perishable foods 
we report our operations in two different business segments fresh products and calavofoods 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
our fresh products business grades  sizes  packs  cools  and ripens if desired avocados for delivery to our customers 
we presently operate three packinghouses in southern california 
these packinghouses handled approximately of the california avocado crop during the fiscal year  based on data obtained from the california avocado commission 
our operating results and the returns we pay our growers are highly dependent on the volume of avocados delivered to our packinghouses  as a significant portion of our costs are fixed 
our strategy calls for continued efforts to retain and recruit growers that meet our business model 
additionally  our fresh products business also procures avocados grown in chile  mexico and peru  as well as other various commodities  including tomatoes  papayas  mushrooms  and pineapples 
we operate a packinghouse in mexico that  together with certain co packers that we frequently purchase fruit from  handled approximately of the mexican avocado crop bound for the united states market and approximately of the avocados exported from mexico to countries other than the united states during the mexican season  based on our estimates 
additionally  during the chilean avocado season  we handled approximately of the chilean avocado crop  based on our estimates 
our strategy is to increase our market share of currently sourced avocados to all accepted marketplaces 
we believe our diversified avocado sources provides a level of supply stability that may  over time  help solidify the demand for avocados among consumers in the united states and elsewhere in the world 
we believe our efforts in distributing our other various commodities  such as those shown above  complement our offerings of avocados 
from time to time  we continue to explore distribution of other crops that provide reasonable returns to the business 
our calavofoods business procures avocados  processes avocados into a wide variety of guacamole products  and distributes the processed product to our customers 
all of our prepared avocado products are now cold pasteurized and include both frozen and fresh guacamole 
additionally  we also prepare various fresh salsa products 
customers include both food service industry and retail businesses 
due to the long shelf life of our frozen guacamole and the purity of our fresh guacamole  we believe that we are well positioned to address the diverse taste and needs of today s customers 
we continue to seek to expand our relationships with major food service companies and develop alliances that will allow our products to reach a larger percentage of the marketplace 
net sales of frozen products represented approximately and of total processed segment sales for the years ended october  and net sales of our ultra high pressure products represented approximately and of total processed segment sales for the years ended october  and our fresh products business is characterized by crop volume and price changes 
furthermore  the operating results of all of our businesses  including our calavofoods business  have been  and will continue to be  affected by quarterly and annual fluctuations and market downturns due to a number of factors  such as pests and disease  weather patterns  changes in demand by consumers  the timing of the receipt  reduction  or cancellation of significant customer orders  the gain or loss of significant customers  market acceptance of our products  our ability to develop  introduce  and market new products on a timely basis  availability and cost of avocados and supplies from growers and vendors  new product introductions by our competitors  change in the mix of avocados and calavofoods we sell  and general economic conditions 
we believe  however  that we are currently positioned to address these risks and deliver favorable operating results for the foreseeable future 
recent developments dividend payment on december   we paid a per share dividend in the aggregate amount of  to shareholders of record on december  
table of contents earn out payment in may  we purchased all of the outstanding shares of hawaiian sweet hs and all ownership interests of hawaiian pride hp from the chairman of our board of directors  chief executive officer and president 
hs and hp engage in tropical product packing and processing operations in hawaii 
pursuant to the acquisition agreement  we made an initial purchase price payment in the aggregate amount of  for both entities on may  we then made two additional annual payments  based on certain operating results the earn out payment s  as defined 
the first annual earn out payment  which was made on september   totaled approximately million 
the second  and final  annual earn out payment  which was made on july   totaled approximately million 
contingencies hacienda suits we are currently under examination by the mexican tax authorities hacienda for the tax year ended december  we have received an assessment totaling approximately million from hacienda related to the amount of income at our mexican subsidiary 
subsequent to that initial assessment  the hacienda offered a settlement of approximately  which we declined 
in the second quarter of  we won our appeal case 
the hacienda subsequently appealed that decision and the case was sent back to the tax court due to administrative error by such jurisdiction 
during the second quarter of  we once again won our appeal and  once again  the hacienda appealed the decision and the case has been sent back to the tax court 
we do not believe that the resolution of this examination will have a significant impact on our results of operations 
we are currently under examination by the mexican tax authorities hacienda for the tax year ended december  we have received an assessment totaling approximately million from hacienda related to the amount of income at our mexican subsidiary  which primarily is related to three issues  one of which represents the majority of the total assessment the primary assessment 
in the fourth quarter of  we received a favorable ruling from the tax court related to the primary assessment  but received an unfavorable ruling related to the remaining issues 
we appealed the unfavorable rulings  which we believe are without merit 
we do not believe that the resolution of this examination will have a significant impact on our results of operations 
in the second quarter of  the hacienda initiated an examination related to the tax year ended december  as well 
we are not aware of any assessments related to this examination  nor do we expect this examination to have a significant impact on our results of operations 
in the first quarter of  we received an assessment totaling approximately  related to the tax year ended december  this assessment relates to depreciation expense taken on such tax return 
based on discussions with legal  we believe that the hacienda s position is without merit and do not believe that the resolution of this examination will have a significant impact on our results of operations 
we pledged our calavofoods building located in uruapan  michoacan  mexico as collateral to the hacienda in regards to these assessments 
from time to time  we are also involved in litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business that we do not believe will have a material adverse impact on our financial statements 
acquisition on february   calavo growers  inc calavo  calavo salsa lisa  llc calavo salsa lisa  lisa s salsa company lsc and elizabeth nicholson and eric nicholson  entered into an asset purchase and contribution agreement  dated february  the acquisition agreement  which sets forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which calavo acquired a percent ownership interest in newly created calavo salsa lisa which acquired substantially all of the assets of lsc 
elizabeth nicholson and eric nicholson  through lsc  hold the remaining percent ownership of calavo salsa lisa 
lsc is a regional producer in the upper midwest of salsa lisa refrigerated salsas 
we believe that this new line of salsas will further diversify our product offerings and will be a natural complement to our ultra high pressure guacamole  as well as our recently introduced calavo tortilla chips 
see note in our consolidated financial statements for further information 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  
table of contents liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate all of our estimates  including those related to the areas of customer and grower receivables  inventories  useful lives of property  plant and equipment  promotional allowances  income taxes  retirement benefits  and commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions as additional information becomes available in future periods 
management has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting estimates in this annual report 
we believe the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
promotional allowances 
we provide for promotional allowances at the time of sale  based on our historical experience 
our estimates are generally based on evaluating the relationship between promotional allowances and gross sales 
the derived percentage is then applied to the current period s sales revenues in order to arrive at the appropriate debit to sales allowances for the period 
the offsetting credit is made to accrued liabilities 
when certain amounts of specific customer accounts are subsequently identified as promotional  they are written off against this allowance 
actual amounts may differ from these estimates and such differences are recognized as an adjustment to net sales in the period they are identified 
a change in the derived percentage for the entire year would impact results of operations by approximately million 
income taxes 
we account for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
measurement of the deferred items is based on enacted tax laws 
in the event the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of our assets and liabilities result in a deferred tax asset  we perform an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such asset 
a valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions  and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions 
if we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary  the liability will be reversed and we will recognize a tax benefit during the period in which it is determined the liability no longer applies 
conversely  we record additional tax charges in a period in which it is determined that a recorded tax liability is less than the ultimate assessment is expected to be 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from management s estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
goodwill  defined as unidentified asset s acquired in conjunction with a business acquisition  is tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below the operating segment 
goodwill impairment testing is a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  and the second step of the impairment test would be unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
goodwill impairment testing requires significant judgment and management estimates  including  but not limited to  the determination of i the number of reporting units  ii the goodwill and other assets and liabilities to be allocated to the reporting units and iii the fair values of the reporting units 
the estimates and assumptions described above  along with other factors such as discount rates  will significantly affect the outcome of the impairment tests and the amounts of any resulting impairment losses 
we performed our annual assessment of goodwill and determined that no impairment existed as of october  
table of contents allowance for accounts receivable 
we provide an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable balances based on historical experience and the aging of the related accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of income  expressed as percentages of our total net sales  for the periods indicated year ended october  net sales gross margins selling  general and administrative operating income interest income interest expense other income  net net income net sales we believe that the fundamentals for our products continue to be favorable 
firstly  americans are eating more avocados 
over the last years  united states us consumption of avocados has expanded at a compounded annual growth rate of and we do not anticipate this growth significantly changing 
we believe that the healthy eating trend that has been developing in the united states contributes to such growth  as avocados  which are cholesterol and sodium free  are dense in fiber  vitamin b  antioxidants  potassium  folate  and contain unsaturated fat  which help lower cholesterol 
also  a growing number of research studies seem to suggest that phytonutrients  which avocados are rich in  help fight chronic illnesses  such as heart disease and cancer 
additionally  we believe that the demographic changes in the us will greatly impact the consumption of avocados and avocado based products 
the hispanic community currently accounts for approximately of the us population  and the total number of hispanics is estimated to triple by the year avocados are considered a staple item purchased by hispanic consumers  as the per capita avocado consumption in mexico is estimated to be more than seven fold that of the us we anticipate avocado products will further penetrate the united states marketplace driven by year round availability of fresh avocados due to imports  a rapid growing hispanic population  and the promotion of the health benefits of avocados 
as the largest marketer of avocado products in the united states  we believe that we are well positioned to leverage this trend and to grow all segments of our business 
additionally  we also believe that avocados and avocado based products will further penetrate other marketplaces that we currently operate in  as interest in avocados continues to expand 
in october  the usda announced the creation of a hass avocado board to promote the sale of hass variety avocados in the us marketplace 
this board provides a basis for a unified funding of promotional activities based on an assessment on all avocados sold in the us marketplace 
the california avocado commission  which receives its funding from california avocado growers  has historically shouldered the promotional and advertising costs supporting avocado sales 
we believe that the incremental funding of promotional and advertising programs in the us will  in the long term  positively impact average selling prices and will favorably impact our avocado businesses 
during fiscal  and  on behalf of avocado growers  we remitted approximately million  million and million to the california avocado commission 
during fiscal  and  we remitted approximately million  million and million to the hass avocado board related to avocados 
sales of products and related costs of products sold are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
service revenue  including freight  ripening  storage  bagging and palletization charges  is recorded when services are performed and sales of the related products are delivered 
we provide for sales returns and promotional allowances at the time of shipment  based on our experience

the following table summarizes our net sales by business segment change change dollars in thousands net sales fresh products calavofoods total net sales as a percentage of net sales fresh products calavofoods net sales for the year ended october   when compared to  increased by approximately million  or  principally as a result of an increase in both our fresh products and calavofoods segments 
the increase in fresh product sales for the year ended october  was primarily related to increased sales of california avocados and tomatoes 
these increases were partially offset  however  by decreased sales from mexican sourced avocados  pineapples and chilean sourced avocados 
while the procurement of fresh avocados related to our fresh products segment is seasonal based on region  our calavofoods business is generally not subject to a seasonal effect 
the increase in net sales delivered by our calavofoods business was due primarily to an increase in pounds sold and an increase in the net sales price compared to prior year 
fresh products fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales delivered by the business increased by approximately million  or  from fiscal to this increase was primarily related to an increase in sales of california sourced avocados due primarily to a significant increase in cartons sold as well as tomatoes due primarily to an increase in units sold and an increase in per unit sales price 
these increases were partially offset  however  by decreased sales from mexican sourced avocados due primarily to a decrease in cartons sold and a decrease in sales price per unit  pineapples due primarily to a decrease in units sold  as well as chilean sourced avocados due primarily to a decrease in cartons sold and a decrease in sales price per unit 

table of contents sales of california sourced avocados increased million  or  for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
california sourced avocado sales reflect a increase in pounds of avocados sold  when compared to the same prior year period 
the increase in california sourced avocados was primarily related to the larger california avocado crop for fiscal our market share of california avocados decreased to for fiscal year  when compared to a market share for the same prior year period 
the average selling price  on a per carton basis  of california avocados sold decreased approximately when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute this decrease to the higher overall volume of california avocados in the marketplace 
california avocados are primarily sold in the us marketplace 
we anticipate that sales of california grown avocados will significantly decrease in fiscal  due to a significantly smaller expected avocado crop 
sales of tomatoes increased million  or  for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
the increase in sales for tomatoes is due to an increase in the average per carton selling price of  in addition to a increase in the number of units sold 
we attribute most of the increase in the per carton selling price to the lower volume of tomatoes in the us marketplace due to weather conditions in florida for fiscal  as compared to the same prior period 
we attribute most of the increase in units sold to growers supplying us with significantly more volume  due primarily to market conditions 
we do not anticipate a significant change in the sales of tomatoes for fiscal  based on current weather conditions in florida 
partially offsetting such increases described above was a decrease in sales of mexican sourced avocados  which decreased million  or  for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
the decrease in mexican sourced avocados was primarily related to the decrease in the volume of mexican fruit sold by million pounds  or  when compared to the same prior year period 
in addition  mexican sourced avocados had a decrease in the average selling price per carton of approximately  when compared to the same prior year period 
as mentioned above  we attribute most of this decrease in volume and price to the increase in volume of california sourced avocados in the us marketplace during fiscal year  as compared to the same prior year period 
sales of pineapples decreased million  or  when compared to the same prior year period 
the decrease in sales for pineapples was primarily due to a decrease in volume by when compared to the same prior year period 
this decrease is primarily related to the expiration of our agreement with maui pineapple company maui in december  which was primarily related to maui exiting the pineapple business 
we do not anticipate a significant change in pineapple sales during fiscal sales of chilean sourced avocados decreased million  or for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
the volume of chilean fruit sold decreased by approximately million pounds  or  when compared to the same prior year period 
this decrease was primarily related to the smaller chilean avocado crop in fiscal year when compared to the crop in fiscal year in addition to the increase in pounds sold  our average selling prices  on a per carton basis  experienced a decrease of for fiscal  when compared to the same prior period 
we attribute most of this decrease in volume and price to the increase in volume of california sourced avocados in the us marketplace during fiscal year  as compared to the same prior year period 
mexican and chilean grown avocados are primarily sold in the us  japanese  and or european marketplace 
we anticipate that the combined sales of mexican and chilean grown avocados will increase in fiscal fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales delivered by the business decreased by approximately million  or  from fiscal to this decrease was primarily related to decreased sales of california avocados  tomatoes  and pineapples 
such decreases were partially offset  however  by increased sales from mexican and chilean sourced avocados 
for fiscal  due to the significant increase in the mexican avocado crop  there was an increase in the volume of avocados delivered to the united states market 
as a result  avocado prices industry wide decreased for most of fiscal  which primarily caused our total avocado revenues to decrease for the year 
for fiscal year  california sourced avocado sales which are primarily sold in the us marketplace reflect a decrease in pounds of avocados sold  when compared to the same prior year period 
this decrease in pounds sold is primarily related to the corresponding decrease in the california avocado crop for fiscal such decrease is believed to be primarily related to poor weather conditions 
our market share of california avocados increased to for fiscal year  when compared to a market share for the same prior year period 
the average selling price  on a per carton basis  of california avocados sold increased approximately when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute some of this increase to the lower overall volume of california avocados in the marketplace 
sales of tomatoes decreased million  or  for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
the decrease in sales for tomatoes is primarily due to the decrease in the average carton selling price by 
this was partially offset by an increase in the volume of tomatoes by approximately million cartons  or  when compared to the same prior year 
table of contents period 
we attribute most of this decrease in the per carton selling price to the out of season production from the us east coast that increased the volume of tomatoes in the us marketplace at the very beginning of the mexican tomato season 
sales of pineapples decreased million  or  when compared to the same prior year period 
the decrease in sales for pineapples is primarily due to the decrease in the per unit selling price by  in addition to the decrease in the volume of pineapples by approximately million units  or  when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute some of this decrease in the per carton selling price to the volume of pineapples in the us marketplace and the recession in the united states 
our agreement with maui pineapple company ended december   and is not expected to be extended 
partially offsetting such decreases was an increase in sales of mexican sourced avocados  which increased million  or  for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
the increase in mexican sourced avocados was primarily related to an increase in the volume of mexican fruit sold of million pounds  or  when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute some of this increase to the large mexican avocado crop for fiscal such increase was partially offset  however  by a decrease in the average carton selling price of mexican avocados  which decreased approximately when compared to the same prior year period 
we attribute some of this decrease to the higher overall volume of mexican avocados in the marketplace 
sales of chilean sourced avocados increased million  or for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
the volume of chilean fruit sold increased by approximately million pounds  or  when compared to the same prior year period 
this increase was primarily related to the improvement of the chilean avocado crop in fiscal year when compared to the disappointing crop in fiscal year in addition to the increase in pounds sold  our average selling prices  on a per carton basis  experienced an increase of for fiscal  when compared to the same prior period 
we attribute some of these price fluctuations to the smaller california avocado crops  as well as the timing of the delivery of such crops  in the marketplace during fiscal calavofoods fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales increased by approximately million  or for fiscal  when compared to the same prior period 
this increase is primarily related to a increase in total pounds sold for fiscal year and an increase in the average net selling price per pound of  when compared to the same prior year period 
the increase in average net selling price is primarily related to a change in sales mix 
in addition  the recently acquired calavo salsa lisa contributed approximately million for fiscal year we currently have two l ultra high pressure machines located in uruapan 
starting in fiscal year  we have begun using the two l ultra high pressure machines to pressurize all product lines within calavofoods including frozen products 
this has caused our operating capacity for these two l ultra high pressure machines to be approximately as of october  our estimated combined operating capacity for these two machines was approximately as of october  a rd ultra high pressure machine with a larger capacity of l has been ordered and is expected to begin operating during our second fiscal quarter of we believe with this rd machine our operating capacity will be in line with our current sales projections and expected growth 
net sales of our ultra high pressure fresh products  typically sold to retail customers  represented approximately and of total processed segment sales for the years ended october  and we believe that these ultra high pressure machines will enable our company to deliver the widest available array of prepared avocado and other products to our customers 
consequently  we believe that we are positioned to expand our ultra high pressure product line to include more avocado related products  mangoes and other readily available fruit products 
we anticipate a marginal increase in sales related to our calavofoods 

table of contents fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales decreased by approximately million  or for fiscal  when compared to the same prior period 
this decrease is primarily related to a decrease in total pounds sold for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
frozen product sales are closely linked to the economic environment of the foodservice industry 
we currently have two l ultra high pressure machines located in uruapan and estimate we are operating at approximately of the combined machines capacities as of october  we believe this combined capacity is reasonable given our current sales projections and expected growth 
net sales of our ultra high pressure products represented approximately and of total processed segment sales for the years ended october  and we believe that these ultra high pressure machines will enable our company to deliver the widest available array of prepared avocado and other products to our customers

gross margins the following table summarizes our gross margins and gross profit percentages by business segment change change dollars in thousands gross margins fresh products calavofoods total gross margins gross profit percentages fresh products calavofoods consolidated our cost of sales consists predominantly of fruit costs  packing materials  freight and handling  labor and overhead including depreciation associated with preparing food products  and other direct expenses pertaining to products sold 
consolidated gross margin  as a percent of sales  stayed consistent at for fiscal year when compared to fiscal year gross margins increased by approximately million  or  for fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period 
this increase was attributable primarily to an increase in our fresh products segment  partially offset by a decrease in our calavofoods segment 
fresh products fiscal vs 
fiscal during fiscal year  as compared to the same prior year period  the increase in our fresh products segment gross margin and gross margin percentage was primarily related to an increase in the gross margin percentage for california avocados 
this was due to a significant increase in the volume of california avocados sold  which increased 
this increase was primarily related to the larger california avocado crop 
this had the effect of decreasing our per pound costs  which  as a result  positively impacted gross margins 
partially offsetting this increase in gross margin was a decrease in margins for mexican sourced avocados due to a similar fruit cost year over year  but at a lower selling price  for mexican sourced avocados 
we believe this decrease in selling price is primarily related to a significantly higher volume of non mexican fruit in the u 
s marketplace  which put downward pressure on carton selling prices 
as a result of this downward pressure  we were not able to purchase mexican sourced fruit as effectively in relation to the selling price as we were able to in the same prior year period 
additionally  we experienced a decrease in the volume of mexican sourced avocados sold by million pounds or  which we believe was primarily related to the aforementioned pricing pressure 
in addition  the us dollar to mexican peso exchange rate weakened during fiscal  when compared to the same prior period 
all of these combined had the effect of increasing our per pound costs  which  as a result  negatively impacted gross margins 
as mentioned above  the weakening of the us dollar compared to the mexican peso negatively affected our gross margin for fiscal year any significant fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the mexican peso may have a material impact on future gross margins for our fresh and calavofoods segments 
the gross margin and gross profit percentage for consignment sales  including certain chilean avocados and tomatoes  are dependent on the volume of fruit we handle  the average selling prices  and the competitiveness of the returns that we provide to 
table of contents third party growers packers 
the gross margin we earn is generally based on a commission agreed to with each party  which usually is a percent of the overall selling price 
although we generally do not take legal title to such avocados and perishable products  we do assume responsibilities principally assuming credit risk  inventory loss and delivery risk  and limited pricing risk that are consistent with acting as a principal in the transaction 
accordingly  our results of operations include sales and cost of sales from the sale of avocados and perishable products procured under consignment arrangements 
for fiscal years  we generated gross margins of million from the sale of fresh produce products that were packed by third parties 
this is a million increase in gross margin for consigned sales compared to previous year 
this increase is due to an increase in tomato sales of for fiscal  when compared to the same prior year period 
the increase in sales for tomatoes is due to an increase in the average per carton selling price of  in addition to a increase in the number of units sold 
we attribute most of the increase in the per carton selling price to the lower volume of tomatoes in the us marketplace due to weather conditions in florida for fiscal  as compared to the same prior period 
we attribute most of the increase in units sold to growers supplying us with significantly more volume  due primarily to market conditions 
fiscal vs 
fiscal during fiscal year  as compared to the same prior year period  the increase in our fresh products segment gross margin percentage was primarily related to a significant decrease in fruit costs for mexican sourced avocados  as well as a decrease in substantially all operating costs related to our mexican operations 
these decreases are primarily related to the large mexican avocado crop  as well as the considerable strengthening of the us dollar compared to the mexican peso 
for fiscal year  when compared to the prior year period  we experienced an increase in the volume of mexican sourced avocados sold by million pounds or 
combined  these had the effect of decreasing our per pound costs  which  as a result  positively impacted gross margins 
such increase was partially offset  however  by a decrease in the average carton selling price of mexican avocados  which decreased approximately when compared to the same prior year period 
collectively  these items positively increased gross margins generated from the sale of mexican avocados from approximately million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the gross margin and gross profit percentage for consignment sales  including chilean avocados  pineapples  and tomatoes  are dependent on the volume of fruit we handle  the average selling prices  and the competitiveness of the returns that we provide to third party growers packers 
the gross margin we earn is generally based on a commission agreed to with each party  which varies from a fixed rate per box to a percent of the overall selling price 
although we generally do not take legal title to such avocados and perishable products  we do assume responsibilities principally assuming credit risk  inventory loss and delivery risk  and limited pricing risk that are consistent with acting as a principal in the transaction 
accordingly  our results of operations include sales and cost of sales from the sale of avocados and perishable products procured under consignment arrangements 
for fiscal years  we generated gross margins of million from the sale of fresh produce products that were packed by third parties 
gross margin percentages related to california avocados are largely dependent on production yields achieved at our packinghouses  current market prices of avocados  our packing and marketing fee  and the volume of avocados packed 
a significant portion of our costs are fixed 
as such  a lower volume of fruit going through our packinghouses will decrease our gross margin percentage 
pounds of california avocados sold decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal this had the effect of increasing our per pound costs  which  as a result  negatively impacted gross margins 
calavofoods fiscal vs 
fiscal gross margin percentages for our calavofoods business are largely dependent on the pricing of our final product and the cost of avocados used in preparing guacamole 
the calavofoods gross profit percentages for the fiscal year  when compared to the same prior year period  decreased million or  primarily as a result of higher fruit and operating costs  partially offset by an increase in total pounds sold by 
we anticipate that the gross profit percentage for our calavofoods segment will continue to experience significant fluctuations during the next fiscal year primarily due to the uncertainty of the cost of fruit that will be used in the production process
