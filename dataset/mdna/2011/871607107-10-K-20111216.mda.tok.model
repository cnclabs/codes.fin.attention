table of contents item a 
risk factors a description of the risk factors associated with our business is set forth below 
investors should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties before investing in our common stock 
the continued uncertainty in the global economy  and its potential impact on the semiconductor and electronics industries in particular  may negatively affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
as a result of the recent global recession  the global economy experienced significant uncertainty  stock market volatility  tightened credit markets  concerns about both deflation and inflation  reduced demand for products  lower consumer confidence  reduced capital spending  liquidity concerns and business insolvencies 
further declines  and uncertainty about future economic conditions  could negatively impact our customers businesses  reducing demand for our products and adversely affecting our business 
the recent global recession adversely affected the semiconductor industry 
semiconductor companies generally remain cautious and focused on their costs  including their research and development budgets which capture spending on eda products and services 
these factors could among other things limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue from committed contracts and in turn adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
under our business model  we generally expect more than of our total revenue to be recurring revenue  as a substantial majority of our customers pay for licenses over a three year period 
however  the turmoil and uncertainty caused by recent economic conditions caused some of our customers to postpone their decision making  decrease their spending and or delay their payments to us 
future periods of decreased committed average annual revenue  customer bankruptcies  or consolidation among our customers  could adversely affect our year over year revenue growth 
the recent global recession also adversely affected the banking and financial industry 
if the global economy continues to experience uncertainty  our ability to obtain credit on favorable terms could be jeopardized 
furthermore  we rely on several large financial institutions to act as counterparties under our foreign currency forward contracts  provide credit and banking transactions and deposit services worldwide 
should any of our banking partners declare bankruptcy or otherwise default on their obligations  it could adversely affect our financial results and our business 
we cannot predict if or when global economic confidence will be restored 
accordingly  our future business and financial results are subject to considerable uncertainty  and our stock price is at risk of volatile change 
if economic conditions fail to significantly improve for any extended period of time or deteriorate in the future  or  in particular  if semiconductor industry revenues do not continue to grow  our future revenues and financial results could be adversely affected 
conversely  in the event of future improvements in economic conditions for our customers  the positive impact on our revenues and financial results may be deferred due to our business model 
the growth of our business depends on the semiconductor and electronics industries 
the growth of the eda industry as a whole  and our business in particular  is dependent on the semiconductor and electronics industries 
the semiconductor industry is currently anticipated to have modest growth in a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends upon the commencement of new design projects by semiconductor manufacturers and their customers 
the increasing complexity of designs of socs and ics  and customers concerns about managing costs  have previously led and in the future could lead to a decrease in design starts and design activity in general  with some customers focusing more on one discrete phase of the design process 
demand for our products and services could decrease and our financial condition and results of operations could 
table of contents be adversely affected if the semiconductor and electronics industries do not continue to grow  or grow at a slower rate 
additionally  as the eda industry matures  consolidation has increased competition for a greater share of our customers eda spending 
this increased competition may cause our revenue growth rate to decline and exert downward pressure on our operating margins  which may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of the acquisitions we complete  or find suitable target businesses and technology to acquire  which could hurt our ability to grow our business  develop new products or sell our products 
acquisitions are an important part of our growth strategy 
we have completed a significant number of acquisitions in recent years  including the acquisitions of coware  inc  vast systems technology corporation  and virage logic corporation 
on november   we entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which we  through our wholly owned subsidiary  have agreed to acquire of the outstanding common stock of magma design automation  inc magma in exchange for cash 
our pending acquisition of magma carries certain risks  including our ability to obtain governmental approvals of the acquisition in a timely manner or at all  the risk that such approvals are not obtained and we must pay a break up fee  risks related to class action lawsuits filed by purported magma stockholders that could be costly  time consuming and affect our ability to close the transaction  and the risk that magma stockholders will not approve the acquisition 
we expect to make additional acquisitions in the future  but we may not find suitable acquisition targets or we may not be able to consummate desired acquisitions due to unfavorable credit markets or other risks  which could harm our operating results 
acquisitions are difficult  time consuming  and pose a number of risks  including potential negative impact on our earnings per share  failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales  problems in integrating the acquired products with our products  difficulties entering into new market segments in which we are not experienced  potential downward pressure on operating margins due to lower operating margins of acquired businesses  increased headcount costs and other expenses associated with adding and supporting new products  difficulties in retaining and integrating key employees  failure to realize expected synergies or cost savings  dilution of our current stockholders through the issuance of common stock  a substantial reduction of our cash resources and or the incurrence of debt  assumption of unknown liabilities  including tax and litigation  and the related expenses and diversion of resources  disruption of ongoing business operations  including diversion of management s attention  potential negative impact on our relationships with customers  distributors and business partners  and negative impact on our earnings resulting from the application of asc  business combinations 
if we do not manage these risks  the acquisitions that we complete may have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
for instance  if  after the closing of our acquisition of magma  we are unable to successfully integrate magma products and technology  we may not be able to achieve the anticipated revenue growth from this transaction 
the integration process may involve significant management time and create uncertainty for employees and customers  and delays in the process 
table of contents could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  expenses  operating results and financial condition 
additionally  if we determine we cannot use or sell the acquired products or technology  we will be required to write down the associated intangible assets  which would negatively impact our operating results 
consolidation among our customers  as well as within the industries in which we operate  may negatively impact our operating results 
a number of business combinations  including mergers  asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships  among our customers and in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred recently  and more could occur in the future 
consolidation among our customers could lead to fewer customers or the loss of customers  increased customer bargaining power  or reduced customer spending on software and services 
moreover  business combinations within the industries in which we compete may result in stronger competition from companies that are better able to compete as sole source vendors to customers 
the loss of customers or reduced customer spending could adversely affect our business and financial condition 
in addition  we and our competitors from time to time acquire business and technologies to complement and expand our respective product offerings 
if any of our competitors consolidate or acquire businesses and technologies which we do not offer  they may be able to offer a larger technology portfolio  a larger support and service capability  or lower prices  which could negatively impact our business and operating results 
changes in accounting principles or standards  or in the way they are applied  could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects and unexpected financial reporting fluctuations  and could adversely affect our reported operating results 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance 
a change in existing principles or guidance can have a significant effect on our reported results and may retroactively affect previously reported results 
additionally  proposed accounting standards could have a significant impact on our operational processes  revenues and expenses  and could cause unexpected financial reporting fluctuations 
for example  the financial accounting standards board fasb is currently working together with the international accounting standards board iasb to converge certain accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies who are required to follow gaap and those who are required to follow international financial reporting standards ifrs 
these efforts may result in different accounting principles under gaap  which may have a material impact on the way in which we report financial results in areas including  but not limited to  revenue recognition  lease accounting  and financial statement presentation 
we expect the sec to make a determination in the near future regarding the incorporation of ifrs into the financial reporting system for us companies 
a change in accounting principles from gaap to ifrs may have a material impact on our financial statements and may retroactively adversely affect previously reported transactions 
our operating results may fluctuate in the future  which may adversely affect our stock price 
our operating results are subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations  which may adversely affect our stock price 
our historical results should not be viewed as indicative of our future performance due to these periodic fluctuations 
many factors may cause our revenue or earnings to fluctuate  including changes in demand for our products due to fluctuations in demand for our customers products and due to constraints in our customers budgets for research and development and eda products and services  
table of contents product competition in the eda industry  which can change rapidly due to industry or customer consolidation and technological innovation  our ability to innovate and introduce new products and services or effectively integrate products and technologies that we acquire  failures or delays in completing sales due to our lengthy sales cycle  cancellations or changes to levels of license orders or the mix between upfront and time based license revenue  our ability to implement effective cost control measures  delay of one or more orders for a particular period  particularly orders generating upfront revenue  our dependence on a relatively small number of large customers for a large portion of our revenue  changes in or challenges to our revenue recognition model  amendments or renewals of customer contracts which provide discounts or require the deferral of revenue to later periods  expenses related to our acquisition and integration of businesses and technology  delays  increased costs or quality issues resulting from our reliance on third parties to manufacture our hardware products  and general economic and political conditions that affect the semiconductor and electronics industries 
these factors  or any other factors or risks discussed herein  could negatively impact our revenue or earnings and cause our stock price to decline 
we operate in highly competitive industries  and if we do not continue to meet our customers demand for innovative technology at lower costs  our business and financial condition will be harmed 
we compete against eda vendors that offer a variety of products and services  such as cadence design systems  inc  mentor graphics corporation and magma 
we also compete with other eda vendors  including frequent new entrants to the marketplace  that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process  as well as vendors of ip products and system level solutions 
moreover  our customers internally develop design tools and capabilities that compete with our products 
the industries in which we operate are highly competitive and the demand for our products and services is dynamic and depends on a number of factors  including demand for our customers products  design starts and our customers budgetary constraints 
technology in these industries evolves rapidly and is characterized by frequent product introductions and improvements and changes in industry standards and customer requirements 
semiconductor device functionality requirements continually increase while feature widths decrease  substantially increasing the complexity  cost and risk of chip design and manufacturing 
at the same time  our customers and potential customers continue to demand an overall lower total cost of design  which can lead to the consolidation of their purchases with one vendor 
in order to succeed in this environment  we must successfully meet our customers technology requirements and increase the value of our products  while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs 

table of contents we compete principally on the basis of technology  product quality and features including ease of use  license or usage terms  post contract customer support  interoperability among products  and price and payment terms 
specifically  we believe the following competitive factors affect our success our ability to anticipate and lead critical development cycles  innovate rapidly and efficiently  improve our existing products  and successfully develop or acquire new products  our ability to offer products that provide both a high level of integration into a comprehensive platform and a high level of individual product performance  our ability to enhance the value of our offering through more favorable terms such as expanded license usage  future purchase rights  price discounts and other unique rights  such as multiple tool copies  post contract customer support  and the ability to purchase pools of technology  and our ability to compete on the basis of payment terms 
if we fail to successfully manage these competitive factors  fail to successfully balance the conflicting demands for innovative technology and lower overall costs  or fail to address new competitive forces  our business and financial condition will be adversely affected 
if we fail to protect our proprietary technology our business will be harmed 
our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology 
our efforts to protect our technology may be costly and unsuccessful 
we rely on agreements with customers  employees and others and on intellectual property laws worldwide to protect our proprietary technology 
these agreements may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
additionally  despite our measures to prevent piracy  other parties may attempt to illegally copy or use our products  which could result in lost revenue 
some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited 
our trade secrets may also otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to assert claims of infringement of our intellectual property  defend our products from piracy  protect our trade secrets or know how  or determine the enforceability  scope and validity of the propriety rights of others 
if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent  copyright or trade secret protection  for any reason  or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in some jurisdictions  our business and operating results would be harmed 
in addition  intellectual property litigation is lengthy  expensive and uncertain and legal fees related to such litigation will increase our operating expenses and may reduce our net income 
unfavorable tax law changes  an unfavorable government review of our tax returns or changes in our geographical earnings mix or forecasts of foreign source income could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our operating results 
our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions 
a change in the tax law in the jurisdictions in which we do business  including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense  could result in a material increase in our tax expense 
currently  a substantial portion of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the united states  and a substantial portion of our assets  
table of contents including employees  are located outside the united states 
united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain non united states subsidiaries to the extent such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries 
a number of proposals for broad reform of the corporate tax system in the united states are under evaluation by various legislative and administrative bodies  but it is not possible to determine accurately the overall impact of such proposals on our effective tax rate at this time 
our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service irs and state  local and foreign taxing authorities 
we exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and  in the ordinary course of our business  there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
the irs examinations of our federal tax returns for the years through and through resulted in significant proposed adjustments which were subsequently settled without a material financial statement impact 
in addition  we are currently being audited in jurisdictions outside the united states 
although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable  we can provide no assurance that any final determination in an audit will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
an assessment of additional taxes as a result of an audit could adversely affect our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made 
we have operations both in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions with a wide range of statutory tax rates 
therefore  any changes in our geographical earnings mix in various tax jurisdictions  including those resulting from transfer pricing adjustments  could materially increase our effective tax rate 
furthermore  we maintain deferred tax assets related to federal foreign tax credits and certain state tax credits 
our ability to use these credits is dependent upon having sufficient future foreign source income in the united states  as well as sufficient taxable income in certain states 
changes in our forecasts of future income could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings which could materially affect our financial results 
we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated  which could increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating results 
we devote substantial resources to research and development 
new competitors  technological advances by existing competitors  our acquisitions  our entry into new markets  or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than we anticipate 
if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue  our operating results could decline 
additionally  our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue which could negatively impact our financial results 
the global nature of our operations exposes us to increased risks and compliance obligations which may adversely affect our business 
we derive more than half of our revenue from sales outside the united states  and we expect our orders and revenue to continue to depend on sales to customers outside the united states 
in addition  we have expanded our non us operations significantly in the past several years 
this strategy requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees  manage multiple  remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the united states 
our international operations and sales subject us to a number of increased risks  including international economic and political conditions  such as political tensions between countries in which we do business  difficulties in adapting to cultural differences in the conduct of business  ineffective legal protection of intellectual property rights  financial risks such as longer payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  
table of contents inadequate local infrastructure that could result in business disruptions  additional taxes and penalties  and other factors beyond our control such as natural disasters  terrorism  civil unrest  war and infectious diseases 
if any of the foreign economies in which we do business deteriorate or if we fail to effectively manage our global operations  our business and results of operations will be harmed 
in addition  our global operations are subject to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations  including those related to anti corruption  tax  corporate governance  imports and exports  financial and other disclosures  privacy and labor relations 
these laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards  making compliance difficult and costly 
if we violate these laws and regulations we could be subject to fines  penalties or criminal sanctions  and may be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries 
although we have implemented policies and procedures to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that our employees  contractors or agents will not violate these laws and regulations 
any violation individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 
our financial statements are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
a weakening us dollar relative to other currencies increases expenses of our foreign subsidiaries when they are translated into us dollars in our consolidated statement of operations 
likewise  a strengthening us dollar relative to other currencies  especially the japanese yen  reduces revenue of our foreign subsidiaries upon translation and consolidation 
exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations  and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations 
although we engage in foreign currency hedging activity  we may be unable to hedge all of our foreign currency risk  which could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
liquidity requirements in our us operations may require us to raise cash in uncertain capital markets  which could negatively affect our financial condition 
as of october   approximately of our worldwide cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balance was held in subsidiary accounts outside the united states 
in addition  typically about half of our operating cash flow is received by our overseas subsidiaries 
should our cash spending needs in the united states rise and exceed our existing us balances  revolving credit facility and future us cash flows  we may be required to incur debt at higher than anticipated interest rates or access other funding sources  which could negatively affect our results of operations  capital structure and or the market price of our common stock 
for example  we expect to partially fund our acquisition of magma using debt  which would require us to draw on our revolving credit facility or to incur additional debt separate from our credit facility 
from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third party intellectual property rights 
we are from time to time subject to claims alleging our infringement of third party intellectual property rights  including patent rights 
for example  in december  a patent infringement lawsuit was filed against us by dynetix design solutions  inc  which seeks  among other things  compensatory damages and a permanent injunction 
further information regarding this lawsuit is contained in part i  item  legal proceedings 
in addition  under our customer agreements and other license agreements  we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe a third party s intellectual property rights 
we have recently defended some of our customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes on a patent held by a japanese electronics company 
although we were successful in that case  there can be no assurances that we will prevail in defending against any current or future claims of infringement 
in addition  these types of claims can result in costly and time 
table of contents consuming litigation  require us to enter into royalty arrangements  subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products  invalidate a patent or family of patents  require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products  any one of which could harm our business and operating results 
product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation and we could lose market share 
software products frequently contain errors or defects  especially when first introduced  when new versions are released or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies 
product errors could affect the performance or interoperability of our products  could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products 
in addition  allegations of ic manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could  even if untrue  adversely affect our reputation and our customers willingness to license ip products from us 
any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers  increase our service costs  subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks  any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
customer payment defaults or related issues could harm our operating results 
the majority of our revenue backlog consists of customer payment obligations not yet due that are attributable to software we have already delivered 
a significant portion of the revenue we recognize in any period comes from backlog and is dependent upon our receipt of cash from customers 
we will not achieve expected revenue and cash flow if customers default  declare bankruptcy  or otherwise fail to pay amounts owed 
moreover  existing customers may seek to renegotiate pre existing contractual commitments due to adverse changes in their own businesses 
our customers financial condition  and in turn their ability or willingness to fulfill their contractual and financial obligations  could be adversely affected by current economic conditions 
if payment defaults by our customers significantly increase or we experience significant reductions in existing contractual commitments  our operating results would be harmed 
we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business 
we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder  consumer  competition  and other issues on a global basis 
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties  and unfavorable rulings could occur 
an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or  in cases for which injunctive relief is sought  an injunction prohibiting us from manufacturing or selling one or more products 
if we were to receive an unfavorable ruling on a matter  our business and results of operations could be materially harmed 
in connection with our definitive agreement to acquire magma  purported magma stockholders filed shareholder class action lawsuits in december against magma  magma s directors and synopsys 
further information regarding these lawsuits is contained in part i  item  legal proceedings 
if we fail to timely recruit and retain senior management and key employees our business may be harmed 
we depend in large part upon the services of key members of our senior management team to drive our future success 
if we were to lose the services of any member of our senior management team  our business could be adversely affected 
to be successful  we must also attract and retain key technical  sales and managerial employees  including those who join synopsys in connection with acquisitions 
there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers  and competition for these individuals is intense and has 
table of contents increased 
our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers 
any failure to recruit and retain key technical  sales and managerial employees could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  efforts to recruit and retain qualified employees could be costly and negatively impact our operating expenses 
we issue stock options and restricted stock units and maintain employee stock purchase plans as a key component of our overall compensation 
we face pressure to limit the use of such equity based compensation due to its dilutive effect on stockholders 
in addition  we are required under gaap to recognize compensation expense in our results from operations for employee share based equity compensation under our equity grants and our employee stock purchase plan  which has increased the pressure to limit equity based compensation 
these factors may make it more difficult for us to grant attractive equity based packages in the future  which could adversely impact and limit our ability to attract and retain key employees 
our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our compliance costs and the risk of noncompliance  which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 
we are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self regulated organizations  including the sec  the nasdaq stock market  and the fasb 
these rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by congress  making compliance more difficult and uncertain 
for example  congress recently passed the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act 
our efforts to comply with the dodd frank act and other new regulations have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
there are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls 
regardless of how well designed and operated it is  a control system can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives will be met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  have been detected 
failure of our control systems to prevent error or fraud could have a material adverse impact on our business 
our investment portfolio may be impaired by deterioration of the capital markets 
our cash equivalent and short term investment portfolio as of october  consists of investment grade municipal bonds  tax exempt money market mutual funds  taxable money market mutual funds and bank deposits 
our investment portfolio carries both interest rate risk and credit risk 
fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a credit downgrade or a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall or a credit downgrade occurs 
as a result of current adverse financial market conditions  including the recent downgrade by standard and poor s s p of the us long term sovereign credit rating  capital pressures on certain banks  especially in europe  and the continuing low interest rate environment  some of our financial instruments may become impaired 
our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be other than temporary 
in addition  we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in the issuer s credit quality or changes in interest rates 

table of contents security breaches could compromise sensitive information belonging to us or our customers and could harm our business and reputation 
we store sensitive data  including intellectual property  our proprietary business information and that of our customers  and confidential employee information  in our data centers and on our networks 
despite our security measures  our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error  malfeasance or other disruptions that could result in unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive information 
any such security breach could cause us to be non compliant with applicable laws or regulations  subject us to legal claims or proceedings  disrupt our operations  damage our reputation  and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services  any of which could adversely affect our business 
catastrophic events may disrupt our business and harm our operating results 
due to the global nature of our business  our operating results may be negatively impacted by catastrophic events throughout the world 
we rely on a global network of infrastructure applications  enterprise applications and technology systems for our development  marketing  operational  support and sales activities 
a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake  fire  telecommunications failure  cybersecurity attack  terrorist attack  or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions  delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers orders 
moreover  our corporate headquarters  a significant portion of our research and development activities  our data centers  and certain other critical business operations are located in california  near major earthquake faults 
a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and  as a result  our operating results would be adversely affected

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following summary of our financial condition and results of operations is qualified in its entirety by the more complete discussion contained in this item and by the risk factors set forth in item a of this annual report 
please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of part of this annual report regarding forward looking statements 
business summary synopsys is a world leader in providing technology solutions used to develop electronics and electronic systems 
we supply the electronic design automation eda software that engineers use to design  create prototypes for and test integrated circuits  also known as chips 
we also supply software and hardware used to develop the systems that incorporate integrated circuits and the software that runs on those integrated circuits 
our intellectual property ip products are pre designed circuits that engineers use as components of larger chip designs rather than redesigning those circuits themselves 
to complement these product offerings  we provide technical services to support our solutions and we help our customers develop chips and electronic systems 
our customers are generally large semiconductor and electronics manufacturers 
our solutions help them overcome the challenge of developing increasingly advanced electronics products while 
table of contents reducing their design and manufacturing costs 
while our products are an important part of our customers development process  our customers research and development budget and spending decisions may be impacted by their business outlook and their willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs 
despite recent global economic uncertainty  we have maintained profitability and positive cash flow on an annual basis in recent years 
we achieved these results not only because of our solid execution  leading technology and strong customer relationships  but also because of our recurring revenue business model 
under this model  a substantial majority of our customers pay for their licenses over time and we typically recognize this recurring revenue over the life of the contract  which averages approximately three years 
recurring revenue generally represents more than of our total revenue 
the revenue we recognize in a particular period generally results from selling efforts in prior periods rather than the current period 
we typically enter each quarter with greater than of our revenue for that particular quarter already committed from our customers  providing for stability and predictability of results 
due to our business model  decreases as well as increases in customer spending do not immediately affect our revenues in a significant way 
the semiconductor industry has experienced modest growth to date in and continued modest growth is currently anticipated for our semiconductor customers remain cautious and focused on their costs due to the cyclical nature of the industry  the increasing complexity of product development and macroeconomic factors 
the continued instability of global markets may intensify an already challenging environment for our customers to plan investment in research and development 
nevertheless  our business outlook is positive based on growth forecasts for the semiconductor industry and our strong financials  diligent expense management  and acquisition strategy 
through our recent acquisitions  we have enhanced our technology and expanded our product portfolio and our total addressable market  especially in ip and system level solutions  which we believe will help drive revenue growth 
we expect to explore both organic and inorganic growth opportunities  including acquiring companies or technology that can contribute to the strategic  operational and financial performance of our business 
we will continue to monitor worldwide economic growth rates  the considerable volatility of current global markets and other macroeconomic factors and may make adjustments to our business in the event that the semiconductor industry is unable to maintain current spending levels for our solutions 
we believe that the combination of our solid financials  leading technology and strong customer relationships will help us successfully execute our strategies 
fiscal year end our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest october fiscal ended on october   fiscal ended on october  and fiscal ended on october  for presentation purposes in this form k  we refer to october as the end of a fiscal year 
fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were week fiscal years 
fiscal will be a week fiscal year  which will impact our revenue  expenses and operating results 
fiscal financial performance summary we continued to derive more than of our revenue from time based licenses  maintenance and services 
our total revenue of  million increased by million  or  from  million in fiscal the increase was attributable to our overall growth  including sales of products associated with our prior year acquisitions  which resulted in increased time based license revenue  upfront license revenue and professional services revenue 
our cost of revenue and operating expenses increased compared to fiscal primarily due to increases in employee related costs driven by increased headcount and other direct costs from our prior year acquisitions 

table of contents our income before provision for income taxes of million increased by million  or  from million in fiscal primarily due to overall growth 
in fiscal  we had lower tax benefits than we had in fiscal  which was the primary cause of our year over year total net income decline from million in fiscal to million in fiscal our net cash flow from operating activities of million increased by million  or  from million in fiscal this increase was primarily from increased customer collections due to our volume of contracts and the timing of billings to customers 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial results under the heading results of operations below are based on our audited results of operations  which we have prepared in accordance with gaap 
in preparing these financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and net income 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
for further information on our significant accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions  judgments and estimates  and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations  are revenue recognition  valuation of stock compensation  valuation of intangible assets  and income taxes 
revenue recognition software license revenue consists of fees associated with the licensing of our software 
maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term licenses and professional services fees 
hardware revenue consists of field programmable gate array fpga board based products 
with respect to software licenses  we utilize three license types technology subscription licenses tsls 
tsls are time based licenses for a finite term  and generally provide the customer limited rights to receive  or to exchange certain quantities of licensed software for  unspecified future technology 
we bundle and do not charge separately for post contract customer support maintenance for the term of the license 
term licenses 
term licenses are also for a finite term  but do not provide the customer any rights to receive  or to exchange licensed software for  unspecified future technology 
customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually for the balance of the term 
the annual maintenance fee is typically calculated as a percentage of the net license fee 
perpetual licenses 
perpetual licenses continue as long as the customer renews maintenance plus an additional years 
perpetual licenses do not provide the customer any rights to receive  or to exchange licensed software for  unspecified future technology 
customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually 

table of contents for the three software license types  we recognize revenue as follows tsls 
we typically recognize revenue from tsl fees which include bundled maintenance ratably over the term of the license period  or as customer installments become due and payable  whichever is later 
revenue attributable to tsls is reported as time based license revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
term licenses 
we recognize revenue from term licenses in full upon shipment of the software if payment terms require the customer to pay at least of the license fee and of the maintenance fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
revenue attributable to these term licenses is reported as upfront license revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
for term licenses in which less than of the license fee and of the maintenance fee is payable within one year from shipment  we recognize revenue as customer payments become due and payable 
such revenue is reported as time based license revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
perpetual licenses 
we recognize revenue from perpetual licenses in full upon shipment of the software if payment terms require the customer to pay at least of the license fee and of the maintenance fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
revenue attributable to these perpetual licenses is reported as upfront license revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
for perpetual licenses in which less than of the license fee and of the maintenance fee is payable within one year from shipment  we recognize revenue as customer installments become due and payable 
such revenue is reported as time based license revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
we also enter into arrangements in which portions of revenue are contingent upon the occurrence of uncertain future events  for example  royalty arrangements 
we refer to this revenue as contingent revenue 
contingent revenue is recognized if and when the applicable event occurs 
such revenue is reported as time based revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
historically  these arrangements have not been material to our total revenue 
we recognize revenue from hardware sales in full upon shipment if all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
revenue attributable to these hardware sales is reported as upfront license revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
hardware sales have not been material to our total revenue 
we infrequently enter into multiple element arrangements that contain both software and non software deliverables such as hardware 
on a prospective basis beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  we applied recently issued accounting guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables for these contracts 
the adoption of the guidance did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements  is not expected to have a material effect on subsequent periods and did not affect the accounting for contracts which do not contain non software deliverables 
the recent accounting guidance addresses whether to treat individual deliverables or groups of deliverables in a multiple element arrangement as separate units of accounting and how to allocate the arrangement consideration to the separate units of accounting 
the guidance also requires that arrangement consideration be allocated to software deliverables as a group and to non software deliverables individually based on relative standalone selling prices and provides guidance for estimating standalone selling prices for purposes of allocating arrangement consideration 
we have determined that the software and non software deliverables in our contracts are separate units of accounting 
prior to the first quarter of fiscal  all deliverables in our contracts were considered one unit of accounting unless we had vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for all undelivered elements 
we now allocate arrangement consideration to separate units of 
table of contents accounting based on estimated standalone selling prices esp because we do not have objective evidence of standalone selling prices 
we estimate the standalone selling prices of our separate units of accounting considering both market conditions and our own specific conditions 
for hardware deliverables  we determine esp using gross margin because we have consistent pricing practices and gross margins for these products 
determining the esp for software deliverables requires significant judgment 
we determine esp for software deliverables after considering customer geographies  market demand and competition at the time of contract negotiation  gross margin objectives  existing portfolio pricing practices  contractually stated prices and prices for similar historical transactions 
under the recent accounting guidance we recognize revenue for our separate units of accounting when all revenue recognition criteria are met 
revenue allocated to hardware units of accounting is recognized upon delivery when all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
revenue allocated to software units of accounting is recognized according to the methods described above depending on the software license type tsl  term license or perpetual license 
we recognize revenue from maintenance fees ratably over the maintenance period to the extent cash has been received or fees become due and payable  and recognize revenue from professional services and training fees as such services are performed and accepted by the customer 
revenue attributable to maintenance  professional services and training is reported as maintenance and service revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
we also enter into arrangements to deliver software products  either alone or together with other products or services that require significant modification  or customization of the software 
we account for such arrangements using the percentage of completion method as we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates that relate to the extent of progress toward completion  contract revenues and costs 
we measure the progress towards completion using the labor hours incurred to complete the project 
revenue attributable to these arrangements is reported as maintenance and service revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
we determine the fair value of each element in multiple element software arrangements that contain only software and software related deliverables based on vsoe 
we limit our assessment of vsoe of fair value for each element to the price charged when such element is sold separately 
we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple element software arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient vsoe to allocate revenue to the maintenance components of our perpetual and term license products and to professional services 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  we recognize license revenue from perpetual and term licenses upon delivery using the residual method  recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term  and recognize revenue from professional services as services are performed and accepted by the customer 
we recognize revenue from tsls ratably over the term of the license  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  since there is not sufficient vsoe to allocate the tsl fee between license and maintenance services 
we make significant judgments related to revenue recognition 
specifically  in connection with each transaction involving our products  we must evaluate whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of software or services has occurred  the fee for such software or services is fixed or determinable  and collectability of the full license or service fee is probable 
all four of these criteria must be met in order for us to recognize revenue with respect to a particular arrangement 
we apply these revenue recognition criteria as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement  our customary policy is to have a written contract  signed by both the customer and by us or a purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard end user license arrangement or purchase agreement 

table of contents delivery has occurred 
we deliver our products to our customers electronically or physically 
for electronic deliveries  delivery occurs when we provide access to our customers to take immediate possession of the software through downloading it to the customer s hardware 
for physical deliveries  the standard transfer terms are typically fob shipping point 
we generally ship our products or license keys promptly after acceptance of customer orders 
however  a number of factors can affect the timing of product shipments and  as a result  timing of revenue recognition  including the delivery dates requested by customers and our operational capacity to fulfill product orders at the end of a fiscal quarter 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
our determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends principally on the arrangement s payment terms 
our standard payment terms for perpetual and term licenses require or more of the license fee and of the maintenance fee to be paid within one year 
if the arrangement includes these terms  we regard the fee as fixed or determinable  and recognize all license revenue under the arrangement in full upon delivery assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if the arrangement does not include these terms  we do not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable and generally recognize revenue when customer installments are due and payable 
in the case of a tsl  because of the right to exchange products or receive unspecified future technology and because vsoe for maintenance services does not exist for a tsl  we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the license  but not in advance of when customers installments become due and payable 
collectability is probable 
we judge collectability of the arrangement fees on a customer by customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy 
we typically sell to customers with whom we have a history of successful collection 
for a new customer  or when an existing customer substantially expands its commitments  we evaluate the customer s financial position and ability to pay and typically assign a credit limit based on that review 
we increase the credit limit only after we have established a successful collection history with the customer 
if we determine at any time that collectability is not probable under a particular arrangement based upon our credit review process or the customer s payment history  we recognize revenue under that arrangement as customer payments are actually received 
valuation of stock compensation stock compensation expense is measured on the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period in accordance with asc  stock compensation 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan awards 
the black scholes option pricing model incorporates various subjective assumptions including expected volatility  expected term and risk free interest rates 
we estimate the expected volatility by a combination of implied volatility for publicly traded options of our stock with a term of six months or longer and the historical stock price volatility over the estimated expected term of our stock awards 
we determine the expected term of our stock awards based on historical experience 
in addition  judgment is required in estimating the forfeiture rate on stock awards 
we calculate the expected forfeiture rate based on average historical trends 
these input factors are subjective and are determined using management s judgment 
if a difference arises between the assumptions used in determining stock compensation cost and the actual factors which become known over time  we may change the input factors used in determining future stock compensation costs 
any such changes could materially impact our results of operations in the period in which the changes are made and in periods thereafter 
valuation of intangible assets we evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets consist of 
table of contents purchased technology  contract rights intangibles  customer relationships  trademarks and trade names  covenants not to compete  capitalized software development and other intangibles 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life 
if this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining useful life  we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results 
we did not record any impairment charges on our intangible assets during fiscal  or income taxes our tax provisions are calculated using estimates in accordance with asc  income taxes 
our estimates and assumptions may differ from the actual results as reflected in our income tax returns and we record the required adjustments when they are identified or resolved 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse  and for tax loss and credit carryovers 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in evaluating our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results  our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  as well as feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
we believe that the net deferred tax assets of approximately million that are recorded on our balance sheet as of october  will ultimately be realized 
however  if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not we will not be able to realize a portion or the full amount of deferred tax assets  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a charge to earnings in the period such determination is made 
we apply a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty associated with the application of complex tax laws 
we are also subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
we believe we have adequately provided in our financial statements for potential additional taxes 
if we ultimately determine that these amounts are not owed  we would reverse the liability and recognize the tax benefit in the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities  we would record an additional charge to earnings 
results of operations revenue background we generate our revenue from the sale of software licenses  maintenance and professional services and to a small extent  hardware products 
under current accounting rules and policies  we recognize revenue from orders we receive for software licenses  services and hardware products at varying times 
in most instances  we recognize revenue on a tsl software license order over the 
table of contents license term and on a term or perpetual software license order in the quarter in which the license is delivered 
substantially all of our current time based licenses are tsls with an average license term of approximately three years 
revenue on contracts requiring significant modification or development is accounted for using the percentage of completion method over the period of the development 
revenue on hardware product orders is generally recognized in full at the time the product is shipped 
contingent revenue is recognized if and when the applicable event occurs 
revenue on maintenance orders is recognized ratably over the maintenance period normally one year 
revenue on professional services orders is generally recognized after services are performed and accepted by the customer 
our revenue in any fiscal quarter is equal to the sum of our time based license  upfront license  maintenance and professional services and hardware revenue for the period 
we derive time based license revenue in any quarter largely from tsl orders received and delivered in prior quarters and to a smaller extent due to contracts in which revenue is recognized as customer installments become due and payable and from contingent revenue arrangements 
we derive upfront license revenue directly from term and perpetual license and hardware product orders mostly booked and shipped during the quarter 
we derive maintenance revenue in any quarter largely from maintenance orders received in prior quarters since our maintenance orders generally yield revenue ratably over a term of one year 
we also derive professional services revenue primarily from orders received in prior quarters  since we recognize revenue from professional services as those services are delivered and accepted  not when they are booked 
our license revenue is sensitive to the mix of tsls and perpetual or term licenses delivered during a reporting period 
a tsl order typically yields lower current quarter revenue but contributes to revenue in future periods 
for example  a  order for a three year tsl delivered on the last day of a quarter typically generates no revenue in that quarter  but  in each of the twelve succeeding quarters 
conversely  perpetual and term licenses with greater than of the license fee due within one year from shipment typically generate current quarter revenue but no future revenue eg  a  order for a perpetual license generates  in revenue in the quarter the product is delivered  but no future revenue 
additionally  revenue in a particular quarter may also be impacted by perpetual and term licenses in which less than of the license fees and of the maintenance fees are payable within one year from shipment as the related revenue will be recognized as revenue in the period when customer payments become due and payable 
our customer arrangements are complex  involving hundreds of products and various license rights  and our customers bargain with us over many aspects of these arrangements 
for example  they often demand a broader portfolio of solutions  support and services and seek more favorable terms such as expanded license usage  future purchase rights and other unique rights at an overall lower total cost 
no single factor typically drives our customers buying decisions  and we compete on all fronts to serve customers in a highly competitive eda market 
customers generally negotiate the total value of the arrangement rather than just unit pricing or volumes 
total revenue year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions our revenues are subject to fluctuations  primarily due to customer requirements  including payment terms  the timing and value of contract renewals and the sale of products associated with prior year acquisitions 
the sequential increase in total revenue from fiscal through fiscal was due to our overall growth  which was benefited by acquisitions  and the related increase in time based revenue  
table of contents upfront revenue and professional services revenue primarily driven by the timing and value of contract renewals  sales of products and professional services contracts including contracts assumed from our prior year acquisitions 
time based license revenue year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions percentage of total revenue the increase in time based license revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to increases in tsl license revenue from arrangements booked in prior periods  higher contingent revenue from royalties and product sales from prior year acquisitions 
the increase in time based license revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the increase in contingent revenue from royalties received and recognized in fiscal upfront license revenue year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions percentage of total revenue changes in upfront license revenue are generally attributable to normal fluctuations in customer requirements which can drive the amount of upfront orders and revenue in any particular period 
the increase in upfront license revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to the increase in sales of our hardware products  perpetual licenses and products associated with prior year acquisitions 
the increase in upfront license revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to higher customer demand in hardware and ip perpetual license requirements 
maintenance and service revenue year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions maintenance revenue professional service and other revenue total percentage of total revenue changes in maintenance revenue are generally attributable to the timing of renewals and the type of contracts renewed on maintenance contracts 
maintenance revenue was relatively flat for fiscal compared to fiscal and decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal professional services and other revenue increased substantially in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to professional services contracts assumed from prior acquisitions 

table of contents professional services and other revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to an increase in recognition of professional services from customer contracts acquired through acquisition offset by a decrease in consulting contracts completed in fiscal cost of revenue and operating expenses year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions cost of revenue operating expenses total total expenses as a percentage of total revenue our expenses are generally impacted by changes in employee related costs including salaries  benefits  stock compensation and variable compensation  changes in amortization and changes in selling and marketing expenses 
the increase in our expenses compared to prior fiscal years was primarily due to an increase in employee related costs driven by increased headcount from our acquisitions and due to an increase in commission expense driven by higher shipments 
furthermore  beginning in fiscal  acquisition related costs such as severance  contract terminations  professional service fees and other directly related costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred as required by revised accounting standards 
prior to fiscal  such costs were recorded as purchase consideration 
we allocate certain human resource programs  information technology and facility expenses among our functional income statement categories based on headcount within each functional area 
annually  or upon a significant change in headcount such as a workforce reduction  realignment or acquisition or other factors  management reviews the allocation methodology and expenses included in the allocation pool 
consequently  fluctuations in these drivers impact the amounts allocated to each functional area 
foreign currency fluctuations  net of hedging  did not have a significant impact on expenses during fiscal as compared to fiscal or fiscal as compared to fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for details on our foreign exchange hedging programs 
cost of revenue year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions cost of license revenue cost of maintenance and service revenue amortization of intangible assets total percentage of total revenue we divide cost of revenue into three categories cost of license revenue  cost of maintenance and service revenue  and amortization of intangible assets 
we segregate expenses directly associated with consulting and training services from cost of license revenue associated with internal functions 
table of contents providing license delivery and post customer contract support services 
we then allocate these group costs between cost of license revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on license and maintenance and service revenue reported 
cost of license revenue 
cost of license revenue includes costs related to products sold and software licensed  allocated operating costs related to product support and distribution costs  royalties paid to third party vendors  and the amortization of capitalized research and development costs associated with software products which have reached technological feasibility 
cost of maintenance and service revenue 
cost of maintenance and service revenue includes operating costs related to maintaining the infrastructure necessary to provide our professional consulting services  and costs associated with the delivery of services  such as production and customization services  hotline and on site support  and documentation of maintenance updates 
amortization of intangible assets 
intangible assets are amortized to cost of revenue and operating expenses  and include the contract rights associated with certain contracts and core developed technology  trademarks  trade names  customer relationships  covenants not to compete and other intangibles related to acquisitions 
cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the increase in professional service revenue 
the increase in cost of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in million in personnel related costs as a result of headcount increases from our prior year acquisitions  an increase of million in costs to provide maintenance and professional services  an increase of million in hardware and license costs  and an increase of million for amortization of intangible assets due to our prior year acquisitions 
cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue was for fiscal years and the increase in cost of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase of million in intangibles amortization primarily as a result of our recent acquisitions  an increase of million in travel related costs  an increase of million in other direct costs and an increase of million in functionally allocated expenses as previously described

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a mix of tax exempt and taxable instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy 
none of these investments are held for trading purposes

we operate internationally and are exposed to potentially adverse movements in currency exchange rates 
the functional currency of each of our active foreign subsidiaries is the foreign subsidiary s local currency  except for our principal irish  hungarian  and swiss subsidiaries  whose functional currencies are the us dollar 
we enter into hedges in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency rate changes on non functional currency denominated forecasted transactions and balance sheet positions including certain assets and liabilities  shipments forecasted to occur within approximately one month  future billings and revenue on previously shipped orders  and certain future intercompany invoices denominated in foreign currencies 
the foreign currency contracts are carried at fair value and denominated in various currencies as listed in the tables below 
the duration of forward contracts usually ranges from one month to months 
a description of our accounting for foreign currency contracts is included in note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the success of our hedging activities depends upon the accuracy of our estimates of various balances and transactions denominated in non functional currencies 
to the extent our estimates are correct  gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts will be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the underlying transactions 
for example  if the euro were to depreciate by compared to the us dollar prior to the settlement of the euro forward contracts listed in the table below providing information as of october   the fair value of the contracts would decrease by approximately million  and we would be required to pay approximately million to the counterparty upon contract maturity 
at the same time  the us dollar value of our euro based expenses would decline  resulting in a gain and positive cash flow of approximately million that would offset the loss and negative cash flow on the maturing forward contracts 
net unrealized loss of approximately million and million  net of tax are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated balance sheets as of october  and october   respectively 
if estimates of our balances and transactions prove inaccurate  we will not be completely hedged  and we will record a gain or loss  depending upon the nature and extent of such inaccuracy 
we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts with financial institutions and have not experienced nonperformance by counterparties 
further  we anticipate performance by all counterparties to such agreements
