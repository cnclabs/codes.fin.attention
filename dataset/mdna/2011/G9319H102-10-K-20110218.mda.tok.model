management of insurance and reinsurance companies use significant judgment in the estimation of reserves for losses and loss expenses 
given the magnitude of recent loss events and other uncertainties inherent in loss estimation  meaningful uncertainty remains regarding the estimation of recent notable loss events 
the company s actual ultimate net loss may vary materially from estimates 
validus re ultimate losses for notable loss events are estimated through detailed review of contracts which are identified by the company as potentially exposed to the specific notable loss event 
however  there can be no assurance that the ultimate loss amount estimated for a specific contract will be accurate  or that all contracts with exposure to a specific notable loss event will be identified in a timely manner

selected ratios the underwriting results of an insurance or reinsurance company are often measured by reference to its combined ratio  which is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
the net loss ratio is calculated by dividing losses and loss expenses incurred including estimates for incurred but not reported losses by net premiums earned

three months three months ended december ended december dollars in thousands  of sub total  of sub total change validus re talbot sub total corporate eliminations total the underwriting results of an insurance or reinsurance company are also often measured by reference to its underwriting income  which is a non gaap financial measure 
underwriting income  as set out in the table below  is reconciled to net income the most directly comparable gaap financial measure by the addition or subtraction of certain consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income line items  as illustrated below 
three months ended three months ended dollars in thousands december  december  underwriting income net investment income other income finance expenses realized gain on repurchase of debentures net realized losses gains on investments net unrealized losses on investments foreign exchange gains net income before tax underwriting income indicates the performance of the company s core underwriting function  excluding revenues and expenses such as the reconciling items in the table above 
the company believes the reporting of underwriting income enhances the understanding of our results by highlighting the underlying profitability of the company s core insurance and reinsurance business 
underwriting profitability is influenced significantly by earned premium growth  adequacy of the company s pricing and loss frequency and severity 
underwriting profitability over time is also influenced by the company s underwriting discipline  which seeks to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification  its management of claims  its use of reinsurance and its ability to manage its expense ratio  which it accomplishes through its management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses 
the company believes that underwriting income provides investors with a valuable measure of profitability derived from underwriting activities 
the company excludes the us gaap measures noted above  in particular net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments  from its calculation of underwriting income because the amount of these gains and losses is heavily influenced by  and fluctuates in part  according to availability of investment market opportunities 
the company believes these amounts are largely independent of its underwriting business and including them distorts 
table of contents the analysis of trends in its operations 
in addition to presenting net income determined in accordance with us gaap  the company believes that showing underwriting income enables investors  analysts  rating agencies and other users of its financial information to more easily analyze the company s results of operations in a manner similar to how management analyzes the company s underlying business performance 
the company uses underwriting income as a primary measure of underwriting results in its analysis of historical financial information and when performing its budgeting and forecasting processes 
analysts  investors and rating agencies who follow the company request this non gaap financial information on a regular basis 
in addition  underwriting income is one of the factors considered by the compensation committee of our board of directors in determining the total annual incentive compensation 
underwriting income should not be viewed as a substitute for us gaap net income as there are inherent material limitations associated with the use of underwriting income as compared to using net income  which is the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure 
the most significant limitation is the ability of users of the financial information to make comparable assessments of underwriting income with other companies  particularly as underwriting income may be defined or calculated differently by other companies 
therefore  the company provides more prominence in this filing to the use of the most comparable us gaap financial measure  net income  which includes the reconciling items in the table above 
the company compensates for these limitations by providing both clear and transparent disclosure of net income and reconciliation of underwriting income to net income 
net investment income net investment income for the three months ended december  was million compared to million for the three months ended december   a decrease of million or 
net investment income decreased due to falling yields in fixed maturity investments

in underwriting years up to and including  talbot s fal has been provided both by talbot and by third parties  thereafter talbot s fal has been provided exclusively by the company 
because the third party fal providers remain on risk until each year of account that their support closes normally after three years 
talbot must retain third party fal even if a third party fal provider has ceased to support the active underwriting year 
this is achieved by placing such fal in escrow outside lloyd s 
thus  the total fal facility available to the company is the total fal for active and prior underwriting years  although the company can only apply specific fal against losses incurred by an underwriting year that such fal is contracted to support 
as of december   the year of account  which was the last year of account supported by the talbot third party fal facility  closed and all third party fal was returned to its providers

the company s loss ratios  excluding prior year development and notable loss events for the year ended december  and were and  respectively 
management of insurance and reinsurance companies use significant judgment in the estimation of reserves for losses and loss expenses 
given the magnitude of recent loss events and other uncertainties inherent in loss estimation  meaningful uncertainty remains regarding the estimation of recent notable loss events 
the company s actual ultimate net loss may vary materially from estimates 
validus re ultimate losses for notable loss events are estimated through detailed review of contracts which are identified by the company as potentially exposed to the specific notable loss event 
however  there can be no assurance that the ultimate loss amount estimated for a specific contract will be accurate  or that all contracts with exposure to a specific notable loss event will be identified in a timely manner 
potential losses in excess of the estimated ultimate loss assigned to a contract on the basis of a specific review  or loss amounts from contracts not specifically included in the detailed review are reserved for in the reserve for potential development on notable loss events 
in the first quarter of  the company incurred million for a reserve for potential development on notable loss events  which in the second quarter of was allocated to development on the chilean earthquake 
in the second quarter of  the company made a provision for losses and loss expenses of million in the reserve for development on notable loss events 
in the third quarter of  the reserve was increased by an additional provision of million 
in the fourth quarter of  no further provisions were made and the company allocated million of the reserve for potential development on notable loss events to development on the new zealand earthquake

selected ratios the underwriting results of an insurance or reinsurance company are often measured by reference to its combined ratio  which is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
the loss ratio is calculated by dividing losses and loss expenses incurred including estimates for incurred but not reported losses by net premiums earned 
the expense ratio is calculated by dividing acquisition costs combined with general and administrative expenses by net premiums earned

the underwriting results of an insurance or reinsurance company are also often measured by reference to its underwriting income  which is a non gaap measure as previously defined 
underwriting income  as set out in the table 
table of contents below  is reconciled to net income the most directly comparable gaap financial measure by the addition or subtraction of net investment income  other income  finance expenses  transaction expenses  realized gain on repurchase of debentures  net realized and unrealized gains losses on investments and foreign exchange gains losses

underwriting income indicates the performance of the company s core underwriting function  excluding revenues and expenses such as the reconciling items in the table above 
the company believes the reporting of underwriting income enhances the understanding of our results by highlighting the underlying profitability of the company s core insurance and reinsurance business 
underwriting profitability is influenced significantly by earned premium growth  adequacy of the company s pricing and loss frequency and severity 
underwriting profitability over time is also influenced by the company s underwriting discipline  which seeks to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification  its management of claims  its use of reinsurance and its ability to manage its expense ratio  which it accomplishes through its management of acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses 
the company believes that underwriting income provides investors with a valuable measure of profitability derived from underwriting activities 
the company excludes the us gaap measures noted above  in particular net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments  from its calculation of underwriting income because the amount of these gains and losses is heavily influenced by  and fluctuates in part  according to availability of investment market opportunities 
the company believes these amounts are largely independent of its underwriting business and including them distorts the analysis of trends in its operations 
in addition to presenting net income determined in accordance with us gaap  the company believes that showing underwriting income enables investors  analysts  rating agencies and other users of its financial information to more easily analyze the company s results of operations in a manner similar to how management analyzes the company s underlying business performance 
the company uses underwriting income as a primary measure of underwriting results in its analysis of historical financial information and when performing its budgeting and forecasting processes 
analysts  investors and rating agencies who follow the company request this non gaap financial information on a regular basis 
in addition  underwriting income is one of the factors considered by the compensation committee of our board of directors in determining total annual incentive compensation 
underwriting income should not be viewed as a substitute for us gaap net income as there are inherent material limitations associated with the use of underwriting income as compared to using net income  which is the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure 
the most significant limitation is the ability of users of the financial information to make comparable assessments of underwriting income with other companies  particularly as underwriting income may be defined or calculated differently by other companies 
therefore  the company provides more prominence in this filing to the use of the most comparable us gaap financial measure  net income  which 
table of contents includes the reconciling items in the table above 
the company compensates for these limitations by providing both clear and transparent disclosure of net income and reconciliation of underwriting income to net income

capital in lloyd s entities  whether personal or corporate  is required to be set annually for the prospective year and held by lloyd s in trust funds at lloyd s or fal 
in underwriting years up to and including  talbot s fal has been provided both by talbot and by third parties  thereafter talbot s fal has been provided exclusively by the company 
because the third party fal providers remain on risk until each year of account that their support closes normally after three years 
talbot must retain third party fal even if a third party fal provider has ceased to support the active underwriting year 
this is achieved by placing such fal in escrow outside lloyd s 
thus the total fal facility available to the company is the total fal for active and prior underwriting years  although the company can only apply specific fal against losses incurred by an underwriting year that such fal is contracted to support

three main sources provide cash flows for the company operating activities  investing activities and financing activities 
cash flow from operating activities is derived primarily from the net receipt of premiums less claims and expenses related to underwriting activities 
cash flow from investing activities is derived primarily from the receipt of net proceeds on the company s investment portfolio 
cash flow from financing activities is derived primarily from the issuance of common shares and debentures payable

during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities of million was driven primarily by increased levels of underwriting net premiums written arising from the impact of the ipc acquisition in late a significant portion of the incurred losses have yet to be paid as of december   which resulted in cash provided from operating activities for the period being higher than net income for the period 
net cash provided by investing activities of million was driven primarily by the net sales of short term securities of million and a decrease in securities lending collateral of million 
the decrease in securities lending collateral was due to the winding down of the securities lending program beginning in the third quarter of net cash used in financing activities of million was driven primarily by the purchase of million of common shares under the company s share repurchase program and the payment of million in quarterly dividends  partially offset by the issuance million of senior notes due during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was driven primarily by net income of million 
cash provided by operating activities  as compared to the year ended december   was affected by the relative movement in change in reserves for losses and loss expenses for the year ended december   due primarily to the settlement of loss reserves 
net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the proceeds on sales of investments to finance the ipc acquisition and the investment of operating surpluses 
net cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by share repurchases of million and aggregate quarterly dividend payments of million 
the decrease in the effect of foreign currency rate changes in cash and cash equivalents is due to relatively stable major currency exchange rates for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as at december   the company s portfolio was composed of fixed income investments  short term and other investments amounting to  million or of total cash and investments

the company s contractual obligations and commitments as at december  are set out below payment due by period less than more than dollars in thousands total year years years years reserve for losses and loss expenses a senior notes b junior subordinated deferrable debentures including interest payments c operating lease obligations total a the reserve for losses and loss expenses represents an estimate  including actuarial and statistical projections at a given point in time of an insurer s or reinsurer s expectations of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of claims incurred 
as a result  it is likely that the ultimate liability will differ from such estimates  perhaps significantly 
such estimates are not precise in that  among other things  they are based on predictions of future developments and estimates of future trends in loss severity and frequency and other variable factors such as inflation  litigation and tort reform 
this uncertainty is heightened by the short time in which the company has operated  thereby providing limited claims loss emergence patterns specifically for the company 
the lack of historical information for the company has necessitated the use of industry loss emergence patterns in deriving ibnr 
further  expected losses and loss ratios are typically developed using vendor and proprietary computer models and these expected loss ratios are a material component in the calculation deriving ibnr 
actual loss ratios will deviate from expected loss ratios and ultimate loss ratios will be greater or less than expected loss ratios 
during the loss settlement period  it often becomes necessary to refine and adjust the estimates of liability on a claim either upward or downward 
even after such adjustments  ultimate liability will exceed or be less than the revised estimates 
the actual payment of the reserve for losses and loss expenses will differ from estimated payouts

the uk government has set out proposals to replace the current system of financial regulation  which it believes has weaknesses  with a new regulatory framework 
the key weakness it identified was that no single institution has the responsibility  authority and tools to monitor the financial system as a whole  and respond accordingly 
that power will be given to the bank of england 
the government will create a new financial policy committee fpc within the bank  which will look at the wider economic and financial risks to the stability of the system 
in addition  the fsa will cease to exist in its current form  and the government will create two new focused financial regulators a new prudential regulation authority pra which will be responsible for the day to day supervision of financial institutions that are subject to significant prudential regulation 
the pra will adopt a more judgment focused approach to regulation so that business models can be challenged  risks identified and action taken to preserve financial stability 
an independent consumer protection and markets authority cpma which will take a tough approach to regulating how firms conduct their business 
the cpma will have a strong mandate for promoting confidence and transparency in financial services and to give greater protection for consumers of financial services 
the consultation on the proposed reforms closed in october and the uk government will present more detailed policy and legislative proposals for further consultation early in the uk government intends to introduce legislation to implement its proposals in mid and the passage of legislation is expected to take approximately one year 
the new regulatory framework is anticipated to be in place by the end of lloyd s is keeping abreast of these developments and lobbying on behalf of the market when necessary

table of contents as of december  and december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
the company has written certain re insurance business that has loss experience generally characterized as having low frequency and high severity 
this results in volatility in both results and operational cash flows 
the potential for large claims or a series of claims under one or more reinsurance contracts means that substantial and unpredictable payments may be required within relatively short periods of time 
as a result  cash flows from operating activities may fluctuate  perhaps significantly  between individual quarters and years 
management believes the company s unused credit facility amounts and highly liquid investment portfolio are sufficient to support any potential operating cash flow deficiencies 
please refer to the table detailing the company s borrowings and credit facilities as at december   presented above 
in addition to relying on premiums received and investment income from the investment portfolio  the company intends to meet these cash flow demands by carrying a substantial amount of short and medium term investments that would mature  or possibly be sold  prior to the settlement of expected liabilities 
the company cannot provide assurance  however  that it will successfully match the structure of its investments with its liabilities due to uncertainty related to the timing and severity of loss events

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are principally exposed to five types of market risk interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  credit risk  liquidity risk  and inflation risk 

table of contents interest rate risk the company s fixed maturity portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these investments 
as interest rates rise  the market value of the company s fixed maturity portfolio falls and the company has the risk that cash outflows will have to be funded by selling assets  which will be trading at depreciated values 
as interest rates decline  the market value of the company s fixed income portfolio increases and the company has reinvestment risk  as funds reinvested will earn less than is necessary to match anticipated liabilities 
we manage interest rate risk by selecting investments with characteristics such as duration  yield  currency and liquidity tailored to the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of the insurance and reinsurance liabilities the company assumes

as at december   the company held million december  million  or december   of the company s fixed maturity portfolio in asset backed and mortgage backed securities 
these assets are exposed to prepayment risk  which occurs when holders of underlying loans increase the frequency with which they prepay the outstanding principal before the maturity date and refinance at a lower interest rate cost 
the adverse impact of prepayment is more evident in a declining interest rate environment 
as a result  the company will be exposed to reinvestment risk  as cash flows received by the company will be accelerated and will be reinvested at the prevailing interest rates 
foreign currency risk certain of the company s reinsurance contracts provide that ultimate losses may be payable in foreign currencies depending on the country of original loss 
foreign currency exchange rate risk exists to the extent that there is an increase in the exchange rate of the foreign currency in which losses are ultimately owed 
therefore  we manage our foreign currency risk by seeking to match our liabilities under insurance and reinsurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies with cash and investments that are denominated in such currencies

as of december   million  or of our total liabilities held in foreign currencies were non monetary items which do not require revaluation at each reporting date 
when necessary  we may also use derivatives to economically hedge un matched foreign currency exposures  specifically forward contracts 
foreign currency forward contracts do not eliminate fluctuations in the value of our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but rather allow us to establish a rate of exchange for a future point in time 
for further information on the accounting treatment of our foreign currency derivatives  refer to item  note derivative instruments used in hedging activities  of the consolidated financial statements 
to the extent foreign currency exposure is not hedged or otherwise matched  the company may experience exchange losses  which in turn would adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk from the possibility that counterparties may default on their obligations to us

we limit our credit exposure by purchasing high quality fixed income investments to maintain an average portfolio credit quality of aa or higher with mortgage and commercial mortgage backed issues having an aggregate weighted average credit quality of aaa 
in addition  we have limited our exposure to any single issuer to or less of total investments  excluding treasury and agency securities

at december   of the portfolio  excluding bank loans was below bbb baa and we did not have an aggregate exposure to any single issuer of more than of total investments  other than with respect to government securities

the company s primary credit risks reside in investment in us corporate bonds and recoverables from reinsurers at the talbot segment 
the company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentration of credit risk arising from its exposure to individual reinsurers

liquidity risk certain of the company s investments may become illiquid 
disruption in the credit markets may materially affect the liquidity of the company s investments  including residential mortgage backed securities which represent december  of total cash and investments 
if the company requires significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of normal cash requirements which could include claims on a major catastrophic event in a period of market illiquidity  the investments may be difficult to sell in a timely manner and may have to be disposed of for less than what may otherwise have been possible under other conditions
