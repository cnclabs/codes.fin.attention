item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report 
operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods 
readers are also urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us which attempt to advise interested parties of the factors which affect our business  including without limitation the disclosures made in item a of part i of this annual report under the caption risk factors 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel pain management therapies 
we are assembling a portfolio of pain management product candidates based on known chemical entities to develop innovative new therapies that we believe may offer substantial advantages over currently available treatment options 
our initial focus is on the management of chronic peripheral neuropathic pain conditions 
our first commercial product is a dermal delivery system designed to treat certain neuropathic pain conditions that was approved by the united states food and drug administration  or fda in november for the management of neuropathic pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia  or phn 
qutenza  the first prescription strength capsaicin product approved in the united states  became commercially available in the first half of in the united states  through a specialty distribution and specialty pharmacy network supported by our own sales force  and in certain european countries through our collaborator astellas pharma europe ltd  or astellas 
in may  qutenza received a marketing authorization or ma  in the european union for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain in non diabetic adults  either alone or in combination with other medicinal products for pain 
in june  we entered into a distribution  marketing and license agreement  or astellas agreement  under which astellas was granted an exclusive license to commercialize qutenza in the european economic area  which includes the countries of the european union  iceland  norway  and liechtenstein as well as switzerland  certain countries in eastern europe  the middle east and africa  which we refer to as the licensed territory 
qutenza was made available on a country by country basis commencing in april  and by year end was available in seventeen european countries 
astellas anticipates introducing qutenza in additional european union countries as well as non european union countries within their territory during we recognize royalty revenue based upon astellas reported net sales of qutenza in the licensed territory 
we recognize royalty revenue from astellas on a quarter lag basis due to timing of astellas reporting such royalties to us 
we plan to submit a supplemental new drug application  or snda  in the first half of in pursuit of a label expansion for qutenza in the united states  or us the label expansion would include patients with hiv associated neuropathy  or hiv an  also known as hiv distal sensory polyneuropathy  or hiv dsp 
the submission is expected to utilize data from two completed phase studies in patients with hiv an  one of which did not meet its primary endpoint 
our plans for continued qutenza development efforts with respect to pdn are being evaluated in light of astellas plans for market support studies and satisfaction of the european medicines agency  or ema  post approval regulatory commitments 
in november  we treated the first patient in a phase clinical study of ngx  a liquid formulation of high concentration capsaicin  in patients with phn 
the phase  adaptive design  clinical study is being conducted in two stages 
the objective of the study is to select the appropriate pretreatment and concentration of ngx for further evaluation in a phase clinical program 
the first stage is designed to determine the shortest tolerable anesthetic pretreatment regimen 
the second stage will evaluate two ngx dose concentrations using the pretreatment regimens determined during stage based on the results from the first stage  the second stage of the study is being conducted without the use of a topical anesthetic pretreatment regimen 
the astellas agreement provides astellas an option to exclusively license ngx in the licensed territory 
if astellas was to exercise its option  they would cooperate with us on the phase clinical trials and share equally in the cost of the trials 

table of contents we also have a series of compounds which represent an early stage pipeline of potential product candidates which include various prodrugs of acetaminophen for potential use in acute pain  including traumatic pain  post surgical pain and fever and various prodrugs of opioids for potential use in chronic pain indications 
these other product candidates are in the pre clinical stage of development and may or may not be the subject of further development in or beyond 
we are currently seeking development partners for our acetaminophen prodrug programs 
to date we have not generated any significant product revenues and have funded our operations primarily by selling equity securities  establishing debt facilities and through the astellas agreement 
our net loss for the fiscal years ended december  and was million and million  respectively  and as of december  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million at december  and during the year ended december   we used cash of million in operating activities 
we expect to continue to incur annual operating losses for the foreseeable future  and expect that our operating loss for the year ending december  will be consistent with our operating loss for the year ended december   as we continue our sales and marketing efforts relating to qutenza in the us  conduct the phase clinical study of ngx and pursue a label expansion for qutenza in the us in april  we borrowed million from cowen healthcare royalty partners  lp  or cowen royalty  and we agreed to repay cowen royalty up to million by assigning cowen royalty one hundred percent of royalty  milestone  option and other payments that we may receive under the astellas agreement until our repayment obligation is satisfied in full 
we anticipate that our existing cash and investments will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements through at least december  critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
product revenue in april  we made qutenza commercially available in the united states to our specialty distributor and specialty pharmacy customers 
under the agreements with our customers  the customers take title to the product upon shipment and only have the right to return damaged product  product shipped in error and expired or short dated product 
as qutenza is new to the marketplace  we are currently assessing the flow of product through our distribution channel  and cannot currently reasonably estimate returns 
until such time as an estimate of returns can be made we are recognizing qutenza product revenues  and related product costs  at the later of the time the product is shipped by the customer to healthcare professionals  and the date of cash collection 
healthcare professionals are generally ordering qutenza in small quantities only after they have identified a patient for treatment 
we believe that revenue recognition upon the later of customer shipment to the end user 
table of contents and the date of cash collection is appropriate until we have sufficient data on cash collection and return patterns of our customers 
we are performing additional procedures to further analyze shipments made by our customers by utilizing shipping data provided by our customers to determine when product is shipped by the customers to healthcare professionals and are evaluating ending inventory levels at our customers each month to assess the risk of product returns 
we have established terms pursuant to distribution agreements with our specialty distributor customers providing for payment within days of the date of shipment to our specialty distributor customers and days of the date of shipment to our specialty pharmacy customers 
such distribution agreements generally have a term of three years 
the application of the above revenue recognition policy resulted in the recognition of net revenue of  from gross shipments of million for the year ended december  our gross shipments are reduced for chargebacks  certain fees paid to distributors and product sales allowances including rebates to qualifying federal and state government programs 
at december   net deferred product revenues totaled  revenue from the astellas agreement in june  we entered into the astellas agreement which provides for an exclusive license by us to astellas for the promotion  distribution and marketing of qutenza in the licensed territory  an option to license ngx  a product candidate that is a non patch liquid formulation of capsaicin  in the licensed territory  participation on a joint steering committee and  through a related supply agreement entered into with astellas the supply agreement  supply of product until direct supply arrangements between astellas and third party manufacturers are established  some of which we anticipate to occur in mid revenue under this arrangement includes upfront non refundable fees and may also include additional option payments for the development of and license to ngx  milestone payments upon achievement of certain product sales levels and royalties on product sales 
we analyze multiple element arrangements  such as the astellas agreement  to determine whether the various performance obligations  or elements  can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
the determination of whether an element can be separated or accounted for as a single unit of accounting is based on the availability of evidence with regard to standalone value of each delivered element 
if the fair value of all undelivered performance obligations can be determined  then all obligations would then be accounted for separately as performed 
if any delivered element is considered to either not have standalone value or have standalone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations are not determinable  then any delivered elements of the arrangement would be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the multiple elements would be grouped and recognized as revenue over the longest estimated performance obligation period 
significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which the performance obligations are estimated to be completed 
in addition  if we are involved in a joint steering committee as part of a multiple element arrangement that is accounted for as a single unit of accounting  an assessment is made as to whether the involvement in the steering committee constitutes a performance obligation or a right to participate 
revenue recognition of non refundable upfront license fees commences when there is a contractual right to receive such payment  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and there are no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
we view the astellas agreement and related agreements  as a multiple element arrangement with the key deliverables consisting of an exclusive license to qutenza in the licensed territory  an obligation to conduct certain development activities associated with ngx  participation on a joint steering committee and supply 
table of contents of qutenza components to astellas until such time that astellas can establish a direct supply relationship with product vendors 
because not all of these elements have both standalone value and objective and reliable evidence of fair value  we are accounting for such elements as a single unit of accounting 
further  the agreement provides for our mandatory participation in a joint steering committee  which we believe represents a substantive performance obligation and also the estimated last delivered element under the astellas agreement and related agreements 
therefore  we are recognizing revenue associated with upfront payments and license fees ratably over the term of the joint steering committee performance obligation 
we estimate this performance obligation will be delivered ratably through june at the inception of the astellas agreement  the upfront license fees were subject to a refund right  which expired upon transfer of our ma for qutenza in the european union to astellas 
in september  the transfer of the ma to astellas was completed and  therefore  the upfront license fees became non refundable and revenue recognition of the upfront license fees commenced 
in the accompanying financial statements  collaboration revenue represents revenue associated with the astellas agreement and related agreements 
deferred collaboration revenue arises from the excess of cash received or receivable over cumulative revenue recognized for the period 
under the terms of the astellas agreement  we earn royalties based on each sale of qutenza into the licensed territory 
the royalty rate is tiered based on the level of sales achieved 
these royalties are considered contingent consideration as we have no remaining contract performance obligation and  therefore  the royalties are excluded from the single unit of accounting discussed above 
we report royalty revenue based upon astellas reported net sales of qutenza in the licensed territory 
we recognize royalty revenue from astellas on a quarter lag basis due to the timing of astellas reporting such royalties to us 
additionally  we can earn milestone payments from astellas if astellas achieves certain sales levels as outlined in the astellas agreement 
as these payments are contingent on astellas performance  they are excluded from the single unit of accounting discussed above 
the milestones will be recorded as revenue when earned as we have no remaining contract performance obligation 
we recognize revenue net of related costs for collaboration supplies sold to astellas upon the product being delivered to astellas 
the revenue and related costs of the product supplied to astellas are included in collaboration revenue 
prior to delivery to astellas  the costs accumulated for the manufacturing of the collaboration supplies are included as prepaid expenses on our balance sheet 
stock based compensation we account for our stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of current authoritative guidance 
under the authoritative guidance  stock based awards  including stock options  are recorded at fair value as of the grant date and recognized to expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period  which we have elected to amortize on a straight line basis 
because non cash stock compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced by an estimate for future forfeitures 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes option valuation model and the assumptions used shown in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
significant judgment is required on the part of management in determining the proper assumptions used in this model 
the assumptions used in the black scholes option valuation model include the risk free interest rate  expected term  expected volatility and expected dividend yield 
we base our assumptions on historical data where available or when not available  on a peer group of companies 
however  these assumptions consist of estimates of future market conditions  which are inherently uncertain  and therefore subject to management s judgment 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further detail 

table of contents inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the specific identification method 
inventories consist of raw materials  work in process and finished goods 
raw materials include certain starting materials used in the production of the active pharmaceutical ingredient of qutenza 
work in process includes the bulk inventory of the active pharmaceutical ingredient  patches and cleansing gel of qutenza that are in the process of being manufactured or have completed manufacture and are awaiting final packaging  including related internal labor and overhead costs 
finished goods include the final packaged kits that contain the qutenza patch and cleansing gel and that are ready for commercial sale 
qutenza received fda approval for sale in the united states during the fourth quarter of  costs incurred prior to fda approval had been recorded as research and development expense on our condensed consolidated statement of operations 
on a quarterly basis  we analyze our inventory levels and write down inventory that has become obsolete  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of the expected net realizable value and inventory that is in excess of expected requirements based upon anticipated product revenues 
during the year ended december   we recorded a charge to cost of goods sold of million for qutenza patches which we do not expect to sell prior to their expiration date 
as a result of the recent product launch of qutenza  the expected inventory requirements based on product revenue and the timing of production runs are subject to significant judgment and management estimate 
clinical trials we accrue and expense costs for clinical trial activities performed by third parties  including clinical research organizations and clinical investigators  based upon estimates made  as of the reporting date  of the work completed through the reporting date as a percentage of the total work contracted for under our agreements with such third parties 
we make our estimates at the end of each reporting period after discussion with internal personnel and outside service providers and thorough evaluation as to progress or stage of completion of trials or services 
on a periodic basis we adjust our estimated clinical trial costs to reflect actual expenses incurred to date 
due to the nature of the estimation of clinical trial costs  we may be required to make changes to our estimates in the future as we become aware of additional information about the status or conduct of clinical trials 
long term obligations on april   the company entered into a financing agreement the financing agreement with cowen healthcare royalty partners  lp  a limited partnership organized under the laws of the state of delaware cowen royalty 
under the terms of the financing agreement  the company borrowed million from cowen royalty the borrowed amount and the company agreed to repay such borrowed amount together with a return to cowen royalty  out of royalty  milestone  option and certain other payments collectively  revenue interest that the company may receive under the astellas agreement 
the accounting for the financing arrangement requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions  including the timing and extent of royalty  milestone  option and other payments to be received from astellas and an internal rate of return we are to pay to cowen 
changes in the estimated revenue interest payments can result in changes in our classification of the current and long term portions of the amounts payable pursuant to the financing agreement  as well as the internal rate of return paid to cowen 
we are also required to make assumptions for the calculation of the estimated fair market value of the long term obligation disclosed in the footnotes to our financial statements 
the key assumptions required for the estimated fair market value calculation are estimates of the amounts and timing of the future royalty revenues and other payments to be received from astellas  the amount and timing of payments to cowen royalty to repay the borrowed amount and an estimated cost of capital the estimate of the future royalty revenues and other payments to be received from astellas is subject to significant variability due to the recent product launch  regulatory process still to be conducted for significant portions of the astellas territory and the extended time period associated with the cowen financing agreement  and thus are subject to significant uncertainty see further discussion of this long term obligation under liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents results of operations in november  we received marketing approval from the fda for qutenza for the management of neuropathic pain associated with phn 
in april   we launched qutenza in the united states 
we are marketing and selling qutenza in the united states through a team of approximately sales professionals 
we have established a distribution network to allow health care providers to access qutenza through specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies 
we are marketing qutenza to high volume prescribing physicians who treat phn patients in private practices  hospitals  military treatment facilities and veterans associations 
our approach requires considerable time and effort to educate and train physicians and their staff prior to their initial qutenza treatments 
we commenced recording collaboration revenue for the upfront payments from astellas in  when the upfront payment of million received from astellas became nonrefundable as a result of our transfer of the qutenza ma to astellas 
we recognized million of the upfront payment as revenue in and million in as of december   we have million remaining in deferred collaborative revenue which will be recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining service period of the joint steering committee  which we estimate will expire in june under our supply agreement with astellas  we are obligated to supply product  at a contractual price which approximates our cost  until such time as astellas establishes its own supply relationship 
as of december   astellas has made qutenza commercially available in seventeen european countries and astellas has informed us that it is continuing its focus on intensive site training on a country by country basis 
we believe that astellas plans to expand qutenza availability in the european union and seek regulatory approvals in certain countries in the remainder of the licensed territory in cost of goods sold includes the cost of products sold  costs associated with services provided by our third party logistics partner for managing the shipping  billing and other administrative functions associated with the distribution channel and also includes royalty obligations due to our intellectual property licensors  uc and lts 
we recognize costs associated with our third party logistics provider in the period in which those costs are incurred  however  costs to manufacture product and royalty obligations due to third parties are deferred and recognized in the period in which the associated revenue is recognized 
costs associated with the manufacture of qutenza prior to regulatory approval were previously expensed in the period in which those costs were incurred 
we believe that the effect on cost of goods sold of previously expensed materials prior to approval is immaterial as compared to what cost of goods sold would have been if such costs were expensed in the period that the product was sold 
our research and development expenses consist of internal and external costs 
our internal costs are primarily employee salaries and benefits  contract employee expense  non cash stock compensation expense  allocated facility and other overhead costs 
our external costs are primarily expenses related to the development of product candidates including formulation development  manufacturing process development  non clinical studies  clinical trial costs  such as the cost of clinical research organizations and clinical investigators  milestone payments to our licensors in connection with the use of certain intellectual property  and costs associated with preparation and filing of regulatory submissions 
additionally  external and internal costs related to manufacturing and quality assurance activities for production batches of our active pharmaceutical ingredient  patches and cleansing gel  which are destined for commercial sale in the united states  were recorded to research and development expense if purchase of such components occurred prior to fda approval 
we commence tracking the separate  external costs of a project when we determine that a project has a reasonable chance of entering clinical development 
senior management discusses the possibility of entering clinical development  along with the possibility of meeting other regulatory milestones  throughout the development cycle 
these discussions include consideration of the costs and time required to bring the project to market and the potential market acceptance 
we do not maintain and evaluate research and development costs by specific therapeutic indications within a program due to the difficulties in allocating such costs to specific 
table of contents indications 
we use our internal research and development resources across several projects and many resources may not be attributable to specific projects or indications 
thus  we do not allocate the internal resources to specific development programs 
over time  we believe that our internal costs are expended on our development projects generally in proportion to our external development costs for such project relative to total external development costs in the years ended december   and  our research and development costs totaled million  million and million  respectively 
the following table reflects the distribution of our research and development costs by development program year ended december  in thousands qutenza ngx acetaminophen prodrug and opioid prodrug internal costs total the process of conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials necessary to obtain marketing approvals in the united states and other regions is costly and time consuming 
the probability of success for each product candidate and clinical trial may be affected by a variety of factors  including  among others  patient enrollment  manufacturing capabilities  successful clinical results  our funding  and competitive and commercial viability 
as a result of these and other factors  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of current or future clinical stages of our product candidates or when or to what extent we will generate revenues from commercialization and sale of any of our unapproved product candidates 
in november  we treated the first patient in a phase clinical study of ngx ngx is our most advanced product candidate and costs to complete development of ngx could be significant 
pursuant to the astellas agreement  we might receive future option payments related to this program at astellas election  however  we are obligated to pay any such amounts to cowen royalty under the terms of the financing agreement 
further  if astellas exercises its option to license ngx  astellas would be responsible for of the costs incurred for phase clinical development 
if we do not obtain regulatory approval for ngx or our other product candidates  or for other indications for qutenza  our ability to achieve additional revenue  our operating results  and our financial position will be adversely affected 
our overall research and development expenses  excluding non cash stock based compensation expense increased in as compared to we expect that it will continue to increase during as we expand development activities for ngx including the on going phase clinical study and initiate activities with the intent of filing a snda for qutenza s label expansion to cover patients with hiv an 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  including those of our sales  marketing  commercial operations and administrative functions such as finance  human resources  legal  medical affairs and information technology 
additionally  selling  general and administrative expenses include marketing expenses  commercialization costs  pharmacovigilance costs and costs associated with our status as a public company and patent costs 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include allocated facility  basic operational and support costs and insurance costs 
we anticipate that our selling  general and administrative expenses may increase over the next several years as a result of our commercialization of qutenza 
these increases are likely to be attributable to increasing marketing activities  costs to maintain and potentially grow our us sales force and infrastructure costs to support commercial operations  and may include adding additional personnel in certain of the key functional areas that support growth of our general operations  including accounting and finance  legal and human resources 

table of contents comparison of years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease increase decrease in thousands  except percentages product revenue collaboration revenue cost of goods sold research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses interest income interest expense other income expense  net product revenue 
due to the limited history of product returns and cash collections from our customers  specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies  we recognize revenue for qutenza at the later of the time our customers ship product to healthcare professionals and cash collections are received by us from our customers 
we recorded gross shipments of qutenza to our customers totaling million in based on our revenue recognition methodology  we recognized net revenue of  as qutenza revenue for the year 
we have deferred product revenue of  at december  which is reported net of associated cost of goods sold of  in our condensed consolidated balance sheet as at december  collaboration revenue 
collaboration revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to the amortization of upfront payments received pursuant to the astellas agreement over a full fiscal year and the recognition of million of collaboration revenue under our supply agreement with astellas 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold totaled  for the year ended december  cost of goods sold includes  for the cost of the finished goods sold that were recognized as revenue in and a charge of  for qutenza patches which we do not expect to sell prior to their expiration date 
the cost of the finished goods sold includes fixed costs of  and variable costs of  as our product revenue increases over time  we expect that our gross margin will improve and may approximate 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million for each of the years ended december  and during we incurred higher expenses of million related to the preparation and commencement of our phase study of ngx and higher expenses of million related to our prodrug program 
however  these expenses were offset by a million decrease in royalties paid to uc in relating to the astellas agreement  a million decrease in clinical consulting fees related to our ma and nda preparation costs and a million decrease in stock based compensation costs due to the achievement of performance based milestones and the granting of options which vested immediately in we expect research and development expense to be higher than the level due to our phase clinical study of ngx and our pursuit of a label expansion for qutenza in the united states 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in this increase was due in large part to the commercial launch of qutenza in the united states in april specifically  the increases included million in costs associated with our sales and commercial operation organization including compensation and benefit costs and travel expenses  million increase in expenses for marketing materials development and other launch related marketing costs  million in costs due to an increase in general and administrative salary and related expenses  temporary help and consultants  professional service fees and other public company costs  million of costs associated with our medical affairs organization including salary and related expenses  million in estimated settlement costs  
table of contents million increase in facilities and office expenses due to expansion of headcount to support commercialization  and a million increase in stock based compensation costs due to the granting of options to employees and officers 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses may increase in over levels  however  the rate of such increase is expected to be significantly lower than the increase from to interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period in this increase was primarily due to interest on the million long term obligation related to the financing agreement entered into with cowen royalty in april other income expense  net 
other income for the year ended december  primarily consisted of a grant earned under section d of the internal revenue code as enacted on march  by the patient protection and affordable care act 
we applied for a grant based upon certain of our and research and development activities 
the payment for the grant of  was received in where as the grant of  is expected to be received in early comparison of years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease increase decrease in thousands  except percentages collaboration revenue research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses interest income interest expense collaboration revenue 
collaboration revenue of million recorded in the year ended december  consisted primarily of million attributed to the amortization of upfront payments received pursuant to the astellas agreement 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million for the same period in our lower spending in research and development reflects our decision to focus our cash and human resources on those activities directly in support of gaining marketing approval for qutenza in the united states and the european union as well as certain limited pre commercialization activities 
specifically  the decrease was attributable to a million decrease in clinical study costs as we completed the phase clinical program which supported our nda filing in  a million decrease in employee related costs commensurate with our reduced clinical trial activity  a million decrease in spending related to ngx and our earlier stage product candidates as these programs were deferred to preserve cash resources  a million reduction in regulatory expenses associated with the preparation and submission of our nda in and support for our ma  a million decrease in quality assurance costs associated with clinical trial activity in  a million decrease associated with the capitalization of employee related costs attributable to the manufacture of commercial product for sale in both the astellas licensed territory and the united states  and a million decrease in manufacturing related costs 
these decreases were partially offset by a million charge representing the sublicense fee payable to the university of california in connection with the receipt of upfront payments from astellas under the astellas agreement as well as a million increase in non cash stock based compensation expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million for the same period in the year over year change was due to a million increase in non cash stock based compensation expense primarily associated with the grant of fully vested stock options to certain of our officers and a million increase in selling  general and administrative employee related expenses as a result of an increase in 
table of contents staffing in support of commercialization activities including the establishment of a medical affairs function 
also contributing to the year over year change was a million increase in costs associated with work to support our pricing and reimbursement strategies 
interest income 
interest income decreased million  or  to less than million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in this change was primarily attributable to a decline in the prevailing interest rates  in general  and lower rates obtained as we moved our invested assets to those with lower relative risk in light of events in the credit markets 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in this decrease was related to the reduction in the outstanding principal balance of notes payable as a result of the scheduled payoff and repayment of principal on the remaining outstanding notes payable 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception through december   we have funded our operations primarily by selling equity securities  establishing debt facilities and through a collaboration agreement with astellas 
on may   we completed an initial public offering of our common stock which resulted in net cash proceeds  after deducting total expenses including underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering related expenses  of million 
in december  we completed the first closing of a private placement of our common stock and warrants resulting in net cash proceeds of million and in january  we completed the second and final closing of this private placement of our common stock and warrants resulting in net cash proceeds of million 
in april  we borrowed million under a financing agreement with cowen royalty 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we also had working capital  adjusted to exclude the current portion of non cash deferred revenue of approximately million  of million 
during  our cash and investment balances were generally held in money market funds and obligations of us government agencies 
cash in excess of immediate operational requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy primarily with a view to capital preservation and liquidity 
further  to reduce portfolio risk  our investment policy specifies a concentration limit of in any one issuer or group of issuers of corporate bonds or commercial paper at the time of purchase 
our investment holdings at december  consist solely of us treasury and money market funds consisting of only us treasury securities 
net cash used by operating activities was million in net cash provided by operating activities in was million primarily resulting from the receipt of an upfront payment under the astellas agreement  partially offset by our net loss during the period 
after adjusting for the affects of the astellas payment  our net cash used in operating activities would have been million in net cash used in operating activities was million in the increase in cash used in operating activities in as compared to resulted primarily from funding the sales and marketing efforts related to the launch of qutenza  supporting our research and development efforts and growth in our general and administrative expenses 
after adjusting for the affects of the astellas payment  the cash used in operating activities was significantly lower than our net cash used in operations in due to our decision in to limit our spending on research and development activities in order to focus resources on supporting our regulatory processes in both the united states and the european union and to certain pre commercialization activities 
included in net cash provided by and used in operating activities are net changes in assets and liabilities affecting cash 
we anticipate that cash used in operating activities may modestly increase in as a result of our efforts to increase sales of qutenza in the united states while conducting the phase clinical study of ngx and pursing a label expansion for qutenza in the united states 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million in and  respectively 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in investing activities consisted primarily of the purchase  sale and maturity of marketable securities and to a lesser extent  the purchase of capital equipment 

table of contents fluctuations in our investing activities have primarily been driven by the timing and receipt of proceeds from financing activities and the upfront payments from astellas 
we expect that property and equipment expenditures in will remain at historical levels in net cash generated in financing activities in was million  primarily due to the proceeds received from the cowen royalty financing 
net cash used in financing activities was million and million in and  respectively 
on april   we entered into a financing agreement with cowen royalty 
under the terms of the financing agreement  we borrowed million from cowen royalty and we agreed to repay the borrowed amount together with a return to cowen royalty  as described below  out of royalty  milestone  option and certain other payments that we may receive under the astellas agreement including payments that astellas may make to us to maintain its option to commercialize ngx in the licensed territory  we refer to such payments under the astellas agreement as the revenue interest 
under the financing agreement  we are obligated to pay to cowen royalty all of the revenue interest payments due to us under the astellas agreement  until cowen royalty has received million of revenue interest payments  and of the revenue interest payments due to us under the astellas agreement for revenue interests received by cowen royalty over million and until cowen royalty has received million of revenue interest payments 
we also have the option to pay a prepayment amount to terminate the financing agreement at our election at any time or in connection with a change of control of neurogesx 
such amount is set at a base amount of million or million if it is being exercised in connection with a change of control  or  if higher  an amount that generates a specified internal rate of return on the borrowed amount as of the date of prepayment  in each case reduced by the revenue interest payments received by cowen royalty up to the date of prepayment 
our obligation to pay the revenue interests during the term of the financing agreement is secured by our rights to the revenue interests under the astellas agreement  and by intellectual property and other rights we have to the extent necessary or used to commercialize products covered by the astellas agreement in the licensed territory 
unless terminated earlier pursuant to a prepayment  the financing agreement also terminates on the earlier of the time when cowen royalty has received at least million of revenue interest payments  or the maturity date  which is the latest to occur of years following the first commercial sale of qutenza in the licensed territory or the last to expire of any patents or regulatory exclusivity covering the products commercialized under the astellas agreement in the licensed territory 
if cowen royalty has not received revenue interest payments totaling at least million by the maturity date  we will be obligated to pay to cowen royalty the difference between such amount and the revenue interests paid to cowen royalty under the financing agreement up to such date 
in addition  in the event we default under the financing agreement  we are obligated to pay to cowen the borrowed amount together with interest accrued thereon from the effective date of the financing agreement  to the date of repayment at a rate equal to the lesser of the rate of interest or the maximum rate permitted by law  less revenue interest payments received by cowen royalty 
financing activities in and consisted primarily of principal repayments on a venture loan financing arrangement which originated in offset by the exercise of stock options and issuance of stock to 
table of contents employees pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan 
in addition to these activities  financing activities in also included a million sale of our common stock and warrants in a private placement transaction 
contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment 
the following table represents our total contractual obligations  including principal and interest  at december   aggregated by type in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total and and and thereafter operating lease obligations long term obligations purchase obligations total represent our future minimum rental commitments for our noncancelable operating lease obligations for our facilities and office equipment 
under the terms of the cowen royalty agreement  payments are contingent upon cash received from astellas under the astellas agreement refer above for discussion 
consists of commitments to third party manufacturers of qutenza and ngx for manufacturing  stability 
the million commitment includes million for stability and related services  million of commitments related to supply of qutenza to astellas  million related to product manufacturing costs for the us market  and million for the phase study for ngx in addition to the above  we have commitments to pay royalties on certain patents we licensed from the university of california for prescription strength capsaicin for neuropathic pain 
under the terms of this license agreement we are required to pay royalties on net sales of the licensed product up to a maximum of  per annum as well as a percentage of upfront and milestone payments or payments resulting from the sublicensing of our rights under the agreement 
we also have commitments to pay royalties under a commercial supply and license agreement with lts to manufacture commercial and clinical supply of qutenza 
under the terms of the agreement  we are required to pay a transfer price for product purchased under the agreement as well as a royalty on net sales of product purchased under such agreement 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the following the success of the commercialization of our products  the costs of establishing sales and marketing infrastructure  distribution capabilities and a sales force  the scope and cost of commercial activities including  but not limited to  costs associated with pharmacovigilance and medical affairs activities  the conduct of manufacturing activities  the costs of carrying out our obligations under our commercial arrangement with astellas  our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations  including licensing and other arrangements that we have or may establish  the costs and timing of seeking regulatory approvals  the progress of our development programs including the number  size and scope of clinical trials and non clinical development  
table of contents the costs involved in enforcing or defending patent claims or other intellectual property rights  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in other products  technologies and businesses 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
during the year ended december   we used a total of million of cash in operating activities 
we anticipate that cash used in operating activities may increase in as a result of our efforts to increase sales of qutenza in the united states while conducting the phase clinical study of ngx and pursing a label expansion for qutenza in the united states 
we anticipate that our existing cash and investments will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements beyond december  to date  we have incurred recurring net losses and negative cash flows from operations  after excluding the upfront cash received from astellas in until we can generate significant cash from our operations  if ever  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources generated from the proceeds of offerings of our equity securities and proceeds from one or more collaboration agreements as well as potentially through royalty monetization  debt financing or the sale of other equity securities 
however  we may not be successful in obtaining additional collaboration agreements  or in receiving milestone or royalty payments under those agreements 
in addition  we cannot be sure that our existing cash and investment resources will be adequate or that additional financing will be available when needed or that  if available  financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
having insufficient funds may require us to delay or potentially eliminate some or all of our development programs  relinquish some or even all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or negotiate less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose 
failure to obtain adequate financing also may adversely affect the launch of our product candidates or our ability to continue in business 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders would likely result 
if we raise additional funds by incurring debt financing  the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business

table of contents reached in eitf issue no 
 milestone method of revenue recognition 
the amendments to the codification provide guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research or development transactions 
consideration that is contingent on achievement of a milestone in its entirety may be recognized as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone is judged to meet certain criteria to be considered substantive 
milestones should be considered substantive in their entirety and may not be bifurcated 
an arrangement may contain both substantive and non substantive milestones  and each milestone should be evaluated individually to determine if it is substantive 
asu no 
is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
if a vendor elects early adoption and the period of adoption is not the beginning of the entity s fiscal year  the entity should apply asu no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate and market risk our exposure to market risk is confined to our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments which have maturities of less than one year 
the goal of our investment policy is primarily liquidity and capital preservation while attempting to maximize the income we receive without assuming significant risk 
to achieve these objectives our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including us government agencies  corporate bonds  commercial paper and money market funds 
further  to reduce portfolio risk through diversification  our investment policy specifies a concentration limit of in any one issuer or group of issuers of corporate bonds or commercial paper at the time of purchase 
our cash and investments as of december  consisted of us treasury securities and money market funds consisting of only us treasury securities 
if interest rates rise  the market value of our investments may decline  which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates by basis points would not result in a material decrease in the fair value of our net investment position 
foreign currency exchange rate risk our third party manufacturers including the manufacturer of our active pharmaceutical ingredient  trans capsaicin  the manufacturer of qutenza and the manufacturer of our cleansing gel  are located in countries outside the united states 
as a result  we may experience changes in product supply costs as a result of changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the local currency where the manufacturing activities occur 
in addition  as we continue to scale up supply of our product components to astellas for commercial sale in the european union and to supply the us market  our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the euro  will increase 
amounts paid to us by astellas under the astellas agreement may be based in euro or other currencies which will then be converted to us dollars before payment to us 
to the extent that these potential receipts are greater than our net payable exposure in euro to our suppliers mentioned above  and to the extent that the timing of these potential payments and receipts differ  we will have a net receivable exposure in euro once qutenza is launched in the european union and certain other foreign territories 
we currently do not engage in foreign currency hedging activities as the short term exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency is relatively small
