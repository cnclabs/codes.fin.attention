item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are one of the largest electrical and mechanical construction and facilities services firms in the united states  canada  the united kingdom and in the world 
we provide services to a broad range of commercial  industrial  utility and institutional customers through over operating subsidiaries and joint venture entities 
our offices are located in the united states  canada and the united kingdom 
in the middle east  we previously carried on business through a joint venture 
we sold our interest in that joint venture in june overview the following table presents selected financial data for the fiscal years ended december   and in millions  except percentages and per share data revenues revenues decrease increase from prior year impairment loss on goodwill and identifiable intangible assets operating loss income operating loss income as a percentage of revenues net loss income attributable to emcor group  inc diluted loss earnings per common share net cash provided by operating activities despite signs of a possible economic recovery  we continue to see a hesitation by many of our customers to commit to capital and maintenance projects particularly in the private nonresidential building and refinery markets 
in addition  we continue to experience a very competitive marketplace where there are a significant number of bidders willing to work at extremely low margins on any given project 
consequently  we tempered our expectations regarding the strength of a near term recovery in our united states facilities services segment and recorded a non cash impairment charge of million during this non cash impairment charge was comprised of million for goodwill and million for certain of our trade names 
because of these non cash impairment charges  lower margin work and a decline in demand  our results reflected an overall decline in our revenues and operating results compared to the decrease in revenues for  when compared to  was primarily attributable to a a decline in work performed on domestic industrial construction projects and a continued decline in work performed on commercial and hospitality construction projects  generally as a result of the economic slowdown  and our decision to only accept work that we believe can be performed at reasonable margins  b continued lower revenues from our international operations for similar reasons and c a decline in organic revenues arising from our united states facilities services segment due to the economic slowdown 
during  companies we acquired in and  that are within our united states facilities services segment  contributed million to revenues and million to operating income net of million of amortization expense attributable to identifiable intangible assets included in cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses 
the decrease in operating income and operating margin operating income as a percentage of revenues for  when compared to  was primarily a result of a the non cash impairment charge discussed above  b lower operating income from our united states electrical construction and facilities services segment  c an operating loss from significant project write downs at our canadian operations and d lower operating income from our united states facilities services segment 
this decrease in operating income was partially offset by a the favorable resolution of uncertainties on certain construction projects at or nearing completion within our domestic construction segments  b the favorable resolution of an historical legal claim on a healthcare construction project within our united states mechanical construction and facilities services segment and c reduced selling  general and administrative expenses primarily as a result of a reduction in our provision for doubtful accounts due to favorable settlements of amounts previously determined to be uncollectible and lower employment costs 
net cash provided by operating activities of million in decreased  when compared to  primarily due to lower operating results  changes in our working capital  including a reduction in accruals for payroll and benefits and a one time contribution of million to a defined benefit pension plan of our united kingdom subsidiary 
we completed two acquisitions during  each for an immaterial amount 
one company provides mobile mechanical services and the other primarily performs government infrastructure contracting services 
both companies have been included in our united states facilities services reporting segment and expand our service capabilities into geographical areas and or markets in which we have not previously operated 
these acquisitions are not material to our results of operations for the years presented 
operating segments our reportable segments reflect certain reclassifications of prior year amounts from our united states mechanical construction and facilities services segment to our united states facilities services segment due to changes in our internal reporting structure 
we have the following reportable segments which provide services associated with the design  integration  installation  start up  operation and maintenance of various systems a united states electrical construction and facilities services involving systems for electrical power transmission and distribution  premises electrical and lighting systems  low voltage systems  such as fire alarm  security and process control  voice and data communication  roadway and transit lighting  and fiber optic lines  b united states mechanical construction and facilities services involving systems for heating  ventilation  air conditioning  refrigeration and clean room process ventilation  fire protection  plumbing  process and high purity piping  water and wastewater treatment  and central plant heating and cooling  c united states facilities services  d canada construction  e united kingdom construction and facilities services  and f other international construction and facilities services

this decrease was partially offset by revenues of million attributable to companies acquired in and  which are reported within our united states facilities services and united states mechanical construction and facilities services segments 
as of december   our backlog was billion  and as of december   our backlog was billion 
backlog increases with awards of new contracts and decreases as we perform work on existing contracts 
the increase in backlog as of december   compared to such backlog at december   was attributable to our international and our united states facilities services segments  offset by a decrease in backlog attributable to our united states electrical construction and facilities services and our united states mechanical construction and facilities services segments 
backlog is not a term recognized under united states generally accepted accounting principles  however  it is a common measurement used in our industry 
backlog includes unrecognized revenues to be realized from uncompleted construction contracts plus unrecognized revenues expected to be realized over the remaining term of facilities services contracts 
however  if the remaining term of a facilities services contract exceeds months  the unrecognized revenues attributable to such contract included in backlog are limited to only the next months of revenues

represents primarily insurance related liabilities and liabilities for deferred income taxes  incentive compensation and earn out arrangements  classified as other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
cash payments for insurance related liabilities may be payable beyond three years  but it is not practical to estimate these payments 
we provide funding to our pension plans based on at least the minimum funding required by applicable regulations 
in determining the minimum required funding  we utilize current actuarial assumptions and exchange rates to forecast estimates of amounts that may be payable for up to five years in the future 
in our judgment  minimum funding estimates beyond a five year time horizon cannot be reliably estimated  and therefore  have not been included in the table 
until february   we had a revolving credit agreement the old revolving credit facility as amended  which provided for a credit facility of million 
effective february   we replaced the old revolving credit facility that was due to expire october  with an amended and restated million revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility expires in february it permits us to increase our borrowing to million if additional lenders are identified and or existing lenders are willing to increase their current commitments 
we may allocate up to million of the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility to letters of credit  which amount compares to million under the old revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility is guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all of our assets and most of the assets of most of our subsidiaries 
the revolving credit facility contains various covenants requiring  among other things  maintenance of certain financial ratios and certain restrictions with respect to payment of dividends  common stock repurchases  investments  acquisitions  indebtedness and capital expenditures 
a commitment fee is payable on the average daily unused amount of the revolving credit facility

the interest rate in effect at december  was 
letter of credit fees issued under this facility range from to of the respective face amounts of the letters of credit issued and are charged based on certain financial tests 
we capitalized approximately million of debt issuance costs associated with the revolving credit facility 
this amount is being amortized over the life of the facility and is included as part of interest expense 
in connection with the termination of the old revolving credit facility  less than million attributable to the acceleration of expense for debt issuance costs was recorded as part of interest expense 
as of december  and december   we had approximately million and million of letters of credit outstanding  respectively 
there were no borrowings under the old revolving credit facility as of december  we have borrowings of million outstanding under the revolving credit facility at december   which remains outstanding at our discretion until the revolving credit facility expires 
based on the million borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facility  if overall interest rates were to increase by basis points  interest expense  net of income taxes  would increase by approximately million in the next twelve months 
conversely  if overall interest rates were to decrease by basis points  interest expense  net of income taxes  would decrease by approximately million in the next twelve months 
on september   we entered into an agreement providing for a million term loan term loan 
the proceeds of the term loan were used to pay a portion of the consideration for an acquisition and costs and expenses incident thereto 
in connection with the closing of the revolving credit facility  we proceeded to borrow million under this facility and used the proceeds along with cash on hand to prepay on february  all indebtedness outstanding under the term loan 
in connection with this prepayment  million attributable to the acceleration of expense for debt issuance costs associated with the term loan was recorded as part of interest expense 
on january   we entered into an interest rate swap  which hedged our interest rate risk associated with the term loan 
we de designated million of the interest rate swap on december  as it was determined that it was no longer probable that the future estimated cash flows were going to occur as originally estimated 
accordingly  we discontinued the application of hedge accounting associated for this portion of the interest rate swap  and million and million was expensed as part of interest expense  and removed from accumulated other comprehensive loss  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the interest rate swap matured in october one of our subsidiaries had a interest in a venture that designs  constructs  owns  operates  leases and maintains facilities to produce chilled water for sale to customers for use in air conditioning commercial properties 
the other venture partner  baltimore gas and electric a subsidiary of constellation energy  had a interest in the venture 
in  the venture  using its own cash and cash from additional capital contributions  acquired its outstanding bonds in the principal amount of million 
as a result of this  we were required to make an additional capital contribution of million to the venture 
in january  this venture  including our investment  was sold to a third party 
as a result of this sale  we received an aggregate amount of million for our interest and recognized a pretax gain of million  which gain is included in our united states facilities services segment and classified as a component of cost of sales on the consolidated statements of operations 
the terms of our construction contracts frequently require that we obtain from surety companies surety companies and provide to our customers payment and performance bonds surety bonds as a condition to the award of such contracts 
the surety bonds secure our payment and performance obligations under such contracts  and we have agreed to indemnify the surety companies for amounts  if any  paid by them in respect of surety bonds issued on our behalf 
in addition  at the request of labor unions representing certain of our employees  surety bonds are sometimes provided to secure obligations for wages and benefits payable to or for such employees 
public sector contracts require surety bonds more frequently than private sector contracts  and accordingly  our bonding requirements typically increase as the amount of public sector work increases 
as of december   based on our percentage of completion of our projects covered by surety bonds  our aggregate estimated exposure  assuming defaults on all our then existing contractual obligations  was approximately billion 
the surety bonds are issued by surety companies in return for premiums  which vary depending on the size and type of bond 
in recent years  there has been a reduction in the aggregate surety bond issuance capacity of surety companies due to the economy and the regulatory environment 
consequently  the availability of surety bonds has become more limited and the terms upon which surety bonds are available have become more restrictive 
we continually monitor our available limits of surety bonds and discuss with our current and other surety bond providers the amount of surety bonds that may be available to us based on our financial strength and the absence of any default by us on any surety bond issued on our behalf 
however  if we experience changes in our bonding relationships or if there are further changes in the surety industry  we may seek to satisfy certain customer requests for surety bonds by posting other forms of collateral in lieu of surety bonds such as letters of credit or guarantees by emcor group  inc  by seeking to convince customers to forego the requirement for surety bonds  by increasing our activities in business segments that rarely require surety bonds such as the facilities services segment  and or by refraining from bidding for certain projects that require surety bonds 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectuate alternatives to providing surety bonds to our customers or to obtain  on favorable terms  sufficient additional work that does not require surety bonds to replace projects requiring surety bonds that we may decide not to pursue 
accordingly  if we were to experience a reduction in the availability of surety bonds  we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and or cash flows 
we do not have any other material financial guarantees or off balance sheet arrangements other than those disclosed herein 
our primary source of liquidity has been  and is expected to continue to be  cash generated by operating activities 
we also maintain our revolving credit facility  that may be utilized  among other things  to meet short term liquidity needs in the event cash generated by operating activities is insufficient or to enable us to seize opportunities to participate in joint ventures or to make acquisitions that may require access to cash on short notice or for any other reason 
however  negative macroeconomic trends may have an adverse effect on liquidity 
in addition to managing borrowings  our focus on the facilities services market is intended to provide an additional buffer against economic downturns inasmuch as a part of our facilities services business is characterized by annual and multi year contracts that provide a more predictable stream of cash flow than the construction business 
short term liquidity is also impacted by the type and length of construction contracts in place 
during past economic downturns  there were typically fewer small discretionary projects from the private sector  and companies like us aggressively bid larger long term infrastructure and public sector contracts 
performance of long duration contracts typically requires greater amounts of working capital 
while we strive to maintain a net over billed position with our customers  there can be no assurance that a net over billed position can be maintained 
our net over billings  defined as the balance sheet accounts billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts less cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
long term liquidity requirements can be expected to be met through cash generated from operating activities and our revolving credit facility 
based upon our current credit ratings and financial position  we can reasonably expect to be able to incur long term debt to fund acquisitions 
over the long term  our primary revenue risk factor continues to be the level of demand for non residential construction services  which is influenced by macroeconomic trends including interest rates and governmental economic policy 
in addition  our ability to perform work is critical to meeting long term liquidity requirements 
we believe that current cash balances and our borrowing capacity available under the revolving credit facility or other forms of financing available to us through borrowings  combined with cash expected to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to provide our short term and foreseeable long term liquidity needs and meet our expected capital expenditure requirements 
however  we are a party to lawsuits and other proceedings in which other parties seek to recover from us amounts ranging from a few thousand dollars to over million 
if we were required to pay damages in one or more such proceedings  such payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and or cash flows 
certain insurance matters as of december  and  we utilized approximately million and million  respectively  of letters of credit obtained under our revolving credit facility and the old revolving credit facility  respectively  as collateral for insurance obligations 
new accounting pronouncements we review new accounting standards to determine the expected financial impact  if any  that the adoption of such standards will have 
as of the filing of this annual report on form k  there were no new accounting standards that were projected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity
