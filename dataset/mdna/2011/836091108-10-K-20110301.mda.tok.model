our clients are located principally in the united states  but we have enhanced our service offering to enable us to deliver multi channel proactive customer communications in countries outside the united states and we plan to begin marketing our service internationally  both directly and through our partners  commencing in europe 
we sell our service primarily through our direct sales force 
we are seeking to increase our revenues from resellers  solution providers  original equipment manufacturers and international distributors both by leveraging existing relationships and by selectively recruiting additional new partners 
key components of results of operations revenues we currently derive substantially all of our revenues by providing our service for use by clients in communicating with their customers through voice  text and email messages 
we provide our service under a usage based pricing model  with prices calculated on a per message or per minute basis in accordance with the terms of our pricing agreements with clients 
we invoice clients on a monthly basis 
our pricing agreements with clients typically do not require minimum levels of usage or payments 
each executed message represents a transaction from which we derive revenues  and we therefore recognize revenue based on actual usage within a calendar month 
we do not recognize revenue until we can determine that 
table of contents persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and we deem collection to be probable 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of delivery costs from our service providers  as well as depreciation expense for our infrastructure and expenses related to hosting and providing support for our platform 
cost of revenues also includes compensation expense for our operations personnel 
as we continue to grow our business and add features to our platform  we expect cost of revenues will continue to increase on an absolute dollar basis 
our annual gross margin ranged from to during the last three fiscal years 
we currently are targeting a quarterly gross margin of to for the foreseeable future 
our gross margin for a quarter may vary significantly from our target range for a number of reasons  including the mix of types of messaging campaigns executed during the quarter  as well as the extent to which we build our infrastructure through  for example  significant acquisitions of hardware or material increases in leased data center facilities 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation expenses and depreciation expense of certain equipment related to the development of our service 
we have historically focused our research and development efforts on improving and enhancing our platform  as well as developing new features and offerings 
sales and marketing

we expect to further invest in developing our marketing strategy and activities to extend brand awareness and generate additional leads for our sales staff 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of compensation expenses for executive  finance  accounting  administrative and management information systems personnel  accounting and legal professional fees and other corporate expenses 
additional key measures of financial performance we present information below with respect to cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow 
free cash flow is a measure of financial performance calculated as cash flow from operating activities plus proceeds from the sale of equipment  less payments of contingent purchase price  investments in capitalized software and purchases of property and equipment 
management uses these metrics to track business performance 
due to the current economic environment  management decisions are based in part  on a goal of maintaining positive cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow 
we believe these metrics are useful measures of the performance of our business because  in contrast to statement of operations metrics that rely principally on revenue and profitability  cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow capture the changes in operating assets and liabilities during the year and the effect of noncash items such as depreciation and stock based compensation 
we believe that  for similar reasons  these metrics are often used by security analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of on demand and other software companies 
the term free cash flow is not defined under us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and is not a measure of operating income  operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap 
all or a portion of free cash flow may be unavailable for discretionary expenditures 
free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool and when assessing our operating performance  you should not consider 
table of contents free cash flow in isolation from or as a substitute for data  such as net income loss  derived from financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
as of december  in thousands cash flows generated from used in operating activities proceeds from sale of equipment contingent purchase price payments to mobile collect investments in capitalized software purchases of property and equipment free cash flow non gaap our operating activities generated net cash in the amount of  for the year ended december  reflecting a net loss of million  which was offset by non cash charges and changes in working capital of million consisting primarily of a depreciation expense of million  b stock based compensation expense of million  and c a decrease in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other assets of  due to the timing of receipts from our clients and the advance payments of certain operating costs 
our operating activities used net cash in the amount of  for the year ended december  reflecting a net loss of million and an increase in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other assets of  mainly due to the timing of receipts from our clients 
these changes were partially offset by non cash charges of million  which consisted primarily of depreciation expense of million  as well as an increase in accrued expenses and accounts payable of  due to the timing of payments to our vendors 
our operating activities generated net cash in the amount of million for the year ended december  reflecting a a net loss of million  b non cash charges of million  which consisted primarily of depreciation expense of million  and c a decrease in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other assets of  these changes were partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses and accounts payable of  due to the timing of payments to our vendors 
the net loss of million includes million received in connection with the settlement of the lawsuit with universal recovery systems  offset in part by million of related expenses 
free cash flow in each of the years presented reflects  in addition to the factors driving cash flow from operating activities  our purchases of property and equipment  which consists primarily of computer equipment and software  investments in capitalized software  proceeds from the sale of our equipment  and our payments of contingent purchase price in connection with our acquisition of the assets of mobile collect in our contingent purchase price obligations to mobile collect extend through critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in the notes to our financial statements  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
a critical accounting policy is one that both is material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments for uncertain matters that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents valuation of goodwill we have recognized goodwill from a asset acquisition in which a significant portion of the consideration is contingent on the future revenues of the acquired assets 
because of the uncertainties with respect to future revenues  the contingent consideration is recognized as additional purchase price as the consideration is determined and becomes payable 
we have remaining contingent consideration totaling million at december   which will increase the recorded carrying value of our goodwill if the contingencies result in additional payments 
recorded goodwill at december  totaled  goodwill is not amortized  but instead is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we evaluate goodwill on an annual basis for impairment and have selected november as the annual impairment testing date 
the company operates as a single operating segment and has concluded that the company is comprised of one reporting unit 
as a result of the economic environment impacting the company s business and operating results coupled with a material decline of the company s stock price  the company determined that impairment triggering events had occurred that would require interim impairment evaluations which resulted in impairment charges totaling  and  in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the fair value of the reporting unit was determined using a market approach  which utilized the company s market capitalization as a basis for estimating fair value 
the fair value of the company s assets and liabilities used in step includes certain identifiable intangible assets  for which fair value is typically measured using an analysis of discounted cash flows 
the quoted market capitalization of the company exceeded its carrying value by approximately at november   the company s most recent annual impairment assessment date 
as such  no indications of impairment were noted  however  our stock price is volatile and future changes in the quoted price of our stock and other judgments that underlay the fair value estimates  including an estimated control premium  may indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  which may result in future impairment charges 
income taxes we are subject to federal and various state income taxes in the united states  and we use estimates in determining our provision for these income taxes 
in addition  we are subject to canadian and uk taxes for profits generated from our wholly owned subsidiaries 
deferred tax assets  related valuation allowances  current tax liabilities and deferred tax liabilities are determined separately by tax jurisdiction 
at december   our deferred tax assets consisted primarily of federal net operating loss carryforwards and state research and development credit carryforwards 
we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized  and we recognize a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this assessment requires judgment as to the likelihood and amounts of future taxable income by tax jurisdiction 
at december   we had a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  which totaled approximately million  due to the current uncertainty related to when  if ever  these assets will be realized 
in the event that we determine in the future that we will be able to realize all or a portion of our net deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the deferred tax valuation allowance would increase earnings in the period in which such a determination is made

liquidity and capital resources resources since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily with proceeds from private placements of preferred stock and our initial public offering of common stock  borrowings under credit facilities and  more recently  cash flow from operations 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents  our projected cash flow from operating activities  and our borrowings available under our existing credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
our future working capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rates of our revenue growth  our introduction of new features for our on demand service  and our expansion of research and development and sales and marketing activities 
to the extent our cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operating activities are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need 
table of contents to raise additional funds through bank credit arrangements or public or private equity or debt financings 
we also may need to raise additional funds in the event we determine in the future to effect one or more acquisitions of businesses  technologies and products 
if additional funding is required  we may not be able to obtain bank credit arrangements or to effect an equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 
credit facility borrowings on february  we renewed a credit facility with silicon valley bank that provides a working capital line of credit at an interest rate of per annum for up to the lesser of a million or b of eligible accounts receivable  subject to specified adjustments 
accounts receivable serve as collateral for any borrowings under the credit facility 
there are certain financial covenant requirements as part of the facility  including an adjusted quick ratio and certain minimum quarterly revenue requirements  none of which are restrictive to our overall operations 
the credit facility will expire by its terms on february  and any amounts outstanding must be repaid on that date 
as of december   no amounts were outstanding under the existing credit agreement 
as of december   letters of credit totaling  had been issued in connection with our facility leases 
operating cash flow for a discussion of our cash flow from operating activities  please see additional key elements of financial performance 
working capital the following table sets forth selected working capital information as of december  dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts working capital our cash and cash equivalents at december  were unrestricted and held for working capital purposes 
they were invested primarily in money market funds 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
our accounts receivable balance fluctuates from period to period  which affects our cash flow from operating activities 
fluctuations vary depending on cash collections  client mix and the volume of monthly usage of our service 
we use days sales outstanding  or dso  calculated on an annual basis  as a measurement of the quality and status of our receivables 
we define dso as a accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  divided by revenues for the most recent year  multiplied by b the number of days in the year 
our dso was days at december   days at december  and days at december  requirements capital expenditures in recent years  we have made capital expenditures primarily to acquire computer hardware and software and  to a lesser extent  furniture and leasehold improvements  to support the growth of our business 
our capital expenditures totaled million in   in and million in internally capitalized software totaled  in we intend to continue to invest in our infrastructure to ensure our continued ability to enhance our platform  introduce new features and maintain the reliability of our network 
we also intend to make investments in computer equipment and systems  as well as fixed assets as we continue to grow our business and add additional personnel 
we expect our capital expenditures for these 
table of contents purposes will approximate million in we are not currently party to any purchase contracts related to future capital expenditures 
contractual obligations and requirements the following table sets forth our commitments to settle contractual obligations as of december  less than to to more than year years years years total dollars in thousands operating leases office space operating leases hosting facilities total our operating leases include a lease for our headquarters in bedford  massachusetts 
a majority of our leases related to hosting facilities are cancelable with a sixty day notice 
effects of inflation inflation and changing prices have not had a material effect on our business since january   and we do not expect that inflation or changing prices will materially affect our business in the foreseeable future 
however  the impact of inflation on replacement costs of equipment  cost of revenues and operating expenses  primarily employee compensation costs  may not be readily recoverable in the pricing of our service 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k of the sec 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board issued guidance to amend the accounting and disclosure requirements for revenue recognition 
these amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  and early adoption is permitted 
we adopted the amendments beginning january  the new guidance modifies the criteria for the separation of deliverables into units of accounting for multiple element arrangements 
we believe that adoption of this new guidance will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
at december   we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
these amounts were invested primarily in money market funds 
the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents were held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical ten percent change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial statements
