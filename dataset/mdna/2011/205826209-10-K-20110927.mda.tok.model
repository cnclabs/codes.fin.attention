as a percentage of consolidated net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and for fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  is primarily attributable to the higher consolidated net sales for fiscal during fiscal  we benefited from certain cost reduction activities including our fiscal decision to no longer offer video encoder and decoder products or market fiberglass antennas to our broadcast customers 
these cost reductions were offset  in part  by million of professional fees that we incurred in connection with our may  merger agreement with cpi 
amortization of stock based compensation expense recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal amortization of stock based compensation for fiscal includes million related to the estimated fair value of an increase in the contractual terms of previously granted stock based awards

as a percentage of consolidated net sales  research and development expenses were and for fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in research and development expenses  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  is attributable to the higher consolidated net sales for fiscal the decrease in research and development expenses is attributable to reductions in spending  including reductions in internal funding for research and development efforts associated with our next generation mts and bft products

amortization of stock based compensation expense recorded as research and development expenses was million including million related to the estimated fair value of an increase in the contractual terms of previously granted stock based awards and million for fiscal and  respectively 
as an investment for the future  we are continually enhancing our existing products and developing new products and technologies 
whenever possible  we seek customer funding for research and development to adapt our products to specialized customer requirements 
during fiscal and  customers reimbursed us million and million  respectively  which is not reflected in the reported research and development expenses  but is included in net sales with the related costs included in cost of sales 
amortization of acquired in process research and development 
there was no amortization of acquired in process research and development projects for fiscal during fiscal  in connection with our august  acquisition of radyne  we immediately amortized million for the estimated fair value of acquired in process research and development projects 
the acquired in process research and development projects were expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative use existed 
of the million of amortization of acquired in process research and development for fiscal  million related to our rf microwave amplifiers segment and million related to our telecommunications transmission segment 
such amounts are included in each respective segment s operating income results 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization relating to intangible assets with finite lives was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
impairment of goodwill 
in fiscal  we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge in our mobile data communications segment 
there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal operating income 
operating income for fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
operating income during fiscal includes a million expense for goodwill impairment 
operating income during fiscal reflects a million charge for acquired in process research and development projects associated with our radyne acquisition 
as further discussed below  the increase is primarily attributable to a significant increase in operating income in our mobile data communications segment  partially offset by a decrease in operating income in both our telecommunications transmission and rf microwave amplifiers segments 
operating income in our telecommunications transmission segment was million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the decrease in operating income is primarily due to this segment s decline in net sales and gross margins which were partially offset by cost reduction activities  as discussed above 
operating income for fiscal includes the impact of million of immediate amortization of acquired in process research and development projects associated with our radyne acquisition 
our rf microwave amplifiers segment generated operating income of million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the decrease in operating income is primarily due to this segment s decline in net sales and  to a lesser extent  an increase in research and development expenditures  as discussed above 
operating income for fiscal includes amortization of million of acquired in process research and development projects associated with our radyne acquisition 
our mobile data communications segment generated operating income of million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal this increase is primarily due to this segment s significantly higher net sales and lower research and development expenses  offset in part by the aforementioned million expense for goodwill impairment 
unallocated operating expenses increased to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal primarily due to professional fees of approximately million associated with our terminated merger and acquisition agreement with cpi 
the increase was offset  in part  by lower amortization of stock based compensation 
amortization of stock based compensation expense  which is included in unallocated operating expenses  amounted to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense during fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of million of our convertible senior notes 
our interest expense during fiscal reflects implied interest expense at related to our convertible senior notes 
our convertible senior notes were fully converted into common shares during the third quarter of our fiscal interest income and other 
interest income and other for fiscal was million  as compared to million for fiscal the decrease of million is primarily attributable to a decline in year over year interest rates offset  in part  by an increase in cash and cash equivalents which generated incremental interest income 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal reflects lower income taxes due to the increase in implied interest expense related to our convertible senior notes 
our effective tax rates for both fiscal and were significantly impacted by the fact that we recorded certain expenses which were non deductible for income tax purposes 
for fiscal  approximately million of the million expense for the impairment of goodwill was non deductible for income tax purposes 
for fiscal  the amortization expense of million for acquired in process research and development was non deductible for income tax purposes 
our effective tax rates for fiscal and also reflect net discrete tax benefits of approximately million and million  respectively 
the discrete tax benefits in fiscal primarily relate to the passage of legislation that included the retroactive extension of the expiration of the federal research and experimentation credit from december  to december  excluding all of the aforementioned items in both periods  our effective tax rate for fiscal was approximately as compared to for fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to the expiration of the federal research and experimentation credit on december  liquidity and capital resources our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents decreased to million at july  from million at july   representing a decrease of million 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents during fiscal was primarily driven by the following net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the net decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in net working capital requirements during fiscal as compared to fiscal  offset in part by higher net income in fiscal including the receipt of the net merger termination fee related to our termination and release agreement with cpi 
historically  we experienced large swings in working capital requirements that are largely caused by our performance related to large contracts such as our current bft contract 
although we expect to generate net cash from operating activities for fiscal  we are unable to accurately predict the amount  which will be significantly impacted by the timing of actual deliveries  collections and vendor payments relating to our overall sales efforts 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal was million as compared to million for fiscal during fiscal  we spent million to purchase property  plant and equipment  including expenditures relating to upgrades and enhancements to our high volume technology manufacturing center in tempe  arizona 
in addition  we made business acquisition payments of million in connection with our acquisition of stampede and million for earn out payments relating to insite consulting  inc insite 
net cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal as compared to million provided by financing activities for fiscal during fiscal  we used million for the repurchase of our common stock pursuant to stock repurchase programs 
during fiscal  we completed a million stock repurchase program and our board of directors authorized a new million stock repurchase program 
on september   our board of directors authorized an increase in our current stock repurchase program from million to million 
in addition  to the repurchase of our shares  we paid million in dividends to our shareholders in fiscal additional information related to our stock repurchase and dividend programs is discussed further below 
our investment policy relating to our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents is intended to minimize principal loss while at the same time maximize the income we receive without significantly increasing risk 
to minimize risk  we generally invest our cash and cash equivalents in money market mutual funds both government and commercial  certificates of deposit  bank deposits  and us treasury securities 
many of our money market mutual funds invest in direct obligations of the us government  bank securities guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation  certificates of deposits and commercial paper and other securities issued by other companies 
while we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity or the ultimate outcome of the current european monetary issues and related concerns  we believe our investment policies are appropriate in the current environment 
ultimately  the availability of our cash and cash equivalents is dependent on a well functioning liquid market 
as of july   we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
as of july   our material short term cash requirements primarily consist of cash necessary to fund i our ongoing working capital needs  ii anticipated quarterly dividends  and iii repurchases of our common stock that we may make pursuant to our stock repurchase program 
in addition  during fiscal  we may also redeploy a large portion of cash and cash equivalents for one or more large acquisitions 
during the fiscal year ended july   we purchased  shares of our common stock in open market transactions at an aggregate cost of million including transaction costs  of which million was unpaid as of july   with an average price per share of 
as of july   million was available for purchases under our then current million stock repurchase program 
on september   our board of directors authorized an increase to our stock repurchase program from million to million 
on september   our board of directors approved an initial dividend program with a targeted annual dividend aggregating per common share 
during fiscal  we paid quarterly dividends of per common share on november   february  and may  totaling million  million and million  respectively 
on august   we paid our fourth quarterly dividend totaling million 
on september   our board of directors raised our annual targeted dividend from per common share to per common share and declared a dividend of per common share payable on november  to shareholders of record at the close of business on october  future dividends are subject to board approval 
our material long term cash requirements primarily consist of the possible use of cash to repay million of our convertible senior notes and payments relating to our operating leases 
in addition  we expect to make future cash payments of approximately million related to our radyne related restructuring plan 
we have historically met both our short term and long term cash requirements with funds provided by a combination of cash and cash equivalent balances  cash generated from operating activities and cash generated from financing transactions 
in light of ongoing tight credit market conditions and overall adverse business conditions  we continue to receive requests from our customers for higher credit limits and longer payment terms 
because of our strong cash position and the nominal amount of interest we are earning on our cash and cash equivalents  we have  on a limited basis  approved certain customer requests 
we continue to monitor our accounts receivable credit portfolio and have not had any material negative customer credit experiences to date 
based on our anticipated level of future sales and operating income  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalent balances and our cash generated from operating activities will be sufficient to meet both our currently anticipated short term and long term operating cash requirements 
although it is difficult in the current economic and credit environment to predict the terms and conditions of financing that may be available in the future  should our short term or long term cash requirements increase beyond our current expectations  we believe that we would have sufficient access to credit from financial institutions and or financing from public and private debt and equity markets
