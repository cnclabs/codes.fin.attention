overview we design and supply high performance network infrastructure connectivity products that provide  enhance and manage computer data communication 
these products facilitate the rapid transfer of data and enable efficient resource sharing between servers and storage devices 
our products are used in enterprise data centers  cloud computing and other environments dependent on high performance  reliable networking 
our products are used in connection with three distinct types of networks storage networks  high performance computing  or hpc  networks  and converged networks 
storage networks are used to provide critical data across enterprise environments and primarily use fibre channel technology 
hpc networks facilitate advanced parallel processing over multiple servers and typically are used for applications where very large amounts of data must be processed quickly and efficiently 
the hpc network products that we sell are based on infiniband technology 
converged networks are designed to address the evolving data center by consolidating and unifying various classes of connectivity and networks  such as storage area networks and local area networks  using ethernet speeds of gb and greater 
for example  fibre channel over ethernet  or fcoe  uses one common ethernet network for both fibre channel storage and ethernet data transmission  thus combining the benefits of fibre channel technology with the pervasiveness of ethernet networks used by most local area networks 
we classify our products into three broad categories host products  network products and silicon products 
host products consist of fibre channel and internet small computer systems interface  or iscsi  host bus adapters  infiniband host channel adapters  and converged network adapters  which consist of adapters based on gb ethernet connectivity 
network products consist of fibre channel switches  including stackable edge switches  bladed switches  virtualized pass through modules  and high port count modular chassis switches  infiniband switches  including high end multi protocol directors  edge and bladed switches  enhanced ethernet pass through modules  and storage routers for bridging fibre channel  fcoe and iscsi networks  and migrating data between storage devices 
silicon products consist of fibre channel controllers  iscsi controllers  converged network controllers and ethernet controllers 
our products are sold worldwide  primarily to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and distributors 
our customers rely on our various networking infrastructure products to deliver solutions to information technology professionals in virtually every business sector 
our products are found primarily in server  workstation and storage subsystem solutions that are used by small  medium and large enterprises with critical business data requirements 
these products are incorporated in solutions from a number of storage system and computer system oem customers  including cisco systems  inc  dell inc  emc corporation  hewlett packard company  international business machines corporation  netapp  inc  oracle corporation and many others 
we use a fifty two fifty three week fiscal year ending on the sunday nearest march fiscal year comprised fifty three weeks and ended on april  fiscal years and each comprised fifty two weeks and ended on march  and march   respectively 
business combination in april  we acquired netxen  inc netxen in a merger transaction 
cash consideration was million for all outstanding netxen capital stock 
netxen developed  marketed and sold ethernet adapter and controller products targeted at the enterprise server market 
the acquisition expanded our product portfolio to include ethernet networking products that were complementary to our existing products 
the acquisition also expanded our expertise to better address a wider range of emerging customer requirements for converged and gb ethernet products 
fiscal year and fourth quarter financial highlights and other information net revenues for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal net income for fiscal increased to million  or per diluted share  from million  or per diluted share  in fiscal in addition  we generated million in cash from operations and used million of cash to purchase our common stock under our stock repurchase program during fiscal a summary of the key factors and significant events which impacted our financial performance during the fourth quarter of fiscal are as follows net revenues of million for the fourth quarter of fiscal increased from million in the fourth quarter of fiscal revenues from host products of million increased by million  or  from million in the same quarter of fiscal revenues from network products of million increased by million  or  from million in the same quarter of fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to for the fourth quarter of fiscal  from for the fourth quarter of fiscal operating income as a percentage of net revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal increased to from in the fourth quarter of fiscal net income of million  or per diluted share  in the fourth quarter of fiscal increased from a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in the fourth quarter of fiscal our net loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal included a million tax charge related to our globalization initiative 
cash  cash equivalents and investment securities increased to million as of april   from million as of march  accounts receivable decreased to million as of april   from million as of march  days sales outstanding dso in receivables of days as of april  decreased from days as of march  inventories were million as of april   compared to million as of march  our annualized inventory turns were turns in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to turns in the fourth quarter of fiscal recent events in japan in march  an earthquake and tsunami occurred off the northeast region of japan resulting in extensive damage throughout the region 
our operations in japan consist of a small sales office that was not impacted 
despite the magnitude of this tragedy  we do not believe it had any impact on our results of operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal this disaster has caused widespread destruction in a region that includes suppliers of components for many technology companies 
although we do not source any critical components directly from this region  we have carefully evaluated the potential impact of these events on our supply chain and have taken proactive steps to mitigate any potential supply risk exposures 
while we will continue to closely monitor this situation  we currently do not expect to have any disruptions to our supply chain that would adversely impact our results of operations 
as a result of this disaster  our major customers may face shortages of components that could negatively impact their ability to build the servers and data center devices into which our products are integrated 
while none of our major customers have advised us of any supply constraints that would materially impact their purchases of our products  we continue to closely monitor their product demand 
if the impact on our supply chain or customer demand as a result of this disaster is significantly different than our current expectation  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
results of operations net revenues a summary of our net revenues by product category is as follows dollars in millions net revenues host products network products silicon products service and other total net revenues percentage of net revenues host products network products silicon products service and other total net revenues historically  the global marketplace for network infrastructure solutions has expanded in response to the information requirements of enterprise data centers  cloud computing and other environments dependent on high performance  reliable networking 
the markets we serve have been characterized by rapid advances in technology and related product performance  which has generally resulted in declining average selling prices over time 
in general  our revenues have been favorably affected by increases in units sold as a result of market expansion and the release of new products 
the favorable effect on our revenues as a result of increases in volume has been partially offset by the impact of declining average selling prices 
the united states and other countries around the world have experienced  and may continue to experience  economic weakness and uncertainty 
economic uncertainty has adversely affected  and in the future may adversely affect  information technology spending rates 
accordingly  it is extremely difficult for us to forecast future sales levels and historical information may not be indicative of future trends 
our net revenues are derived primarily from the sale of host products  network products and silicon products 
net revenues increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase was primarily the result of a million  or  increase in revenue from host products  a million  or  increase in revenue from network products  and an million  or  increase in revenue from silicon products 
the increase in revenue from host products was primarily due to an increase in the quantity of adapters sold 
the increase in revenue from network products was primarily due to a increase in the quantity of switches sold  partially offset by a decrease in the average selling prices of these products 
the increase in revenue from silicon products was due primarily to an increase in the quantity of chips sold 
net revenues for fiscal included million of service and other revenues compared with million of service and other revenues for fiscal we do not expect service and other revenues to be significant to our overall revenues 
net revenues decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this decrease was primarily the result of a million  or  decrease in revenue from host products  an million  or  decrease in revenue from network products  and a million  or  decrease in revenue from silicon products 
the decrease in revenue from host products was primarily due to a decrease in the quantity of adapters sold and a decrease in the average selling prices of these products 
the decrease in revenue from network products was primarily due to a decrease in the number of switches sold and a decrease in the average selling prices of these products 
the decrease in revenue from silicon products was due primarily to an decrease in the units of protocol chips sold  an decrease in the average selling prices of these products and a million decrease in revenue from management controller chips  as these products reached end of life in fiscal net revenues for fiscal included million of service and other revenues compared with million of service and other revenues for fiscal a small number of our customers account for a substantial portion of our net revenues  and we expect that a small number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our net revenues for the foreseeable future 
our top ten customers accounted for  and of net revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
a summary of our customers  including their manufacturing subcontractors  that represent or more of our net revenues is as follows hewlett packard ibm dell sun microsystems acquired by oracle in fiscal less than of net revenues 
we believe our major customers continually evaluate whether or not to purchase products from alternative or additional sources 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that a major customer will not reduce  delay or eliminate its purchases from us 
any such reduction  delay or loss of purchases could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
net revenues by geographic area are as follows in millions united states asia pacific and japan europe  middle east and africa rest of world revenues by geographic area are presented based upon the ship to location of the customer  which is not necessarily indicative of the location of the ultimate end user of our products 
no individual country other than the united states and china represented or more of net revenues for any of the years presented 
net revenues from customers in china were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
gross profit gross profit represents net revenues less cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of purchased products  assembly and test services  costs associated with product procurement  inventory management  logistics and product quality  and the amortization of purchased intangible assets 
a summary of our gross profit and related percentage of net revenues is as follows dollars in millions gross profit percentage of net revenues gross profit for fiscal increased million  or  from gross profit for fiscal and increased as a percentage of revenue to for fiscal from for the prior year 
the increase in gross profit percentage was primarily due to higher volumes to absorb manufacturing costs and a million decrease in amortization of purchased intangible assets 
gross profit for fiscal decreased million  or  from gross profit for fiscal and decreased as a percentage of revenue to for fiscal from for the prior year 
the decrease in gross profit percentage was primarily due to lower volumes to absorb manufacturing costs  a change in product mix and a million one time royalty in fiscal  partially offset by a million decrease in amortization of purchased intangible assets 
our ability to maintain our current gross profit percentage can be significantly affected by factors such as manufacturing volumes over which fixed costs are absorbed  sales discounts and customer incentives  component costs  the mix of products shipped  the transition to new products  competitive price pressures  the timeliness of volume shipments of new products  our ability to achieve manufacturing cost reductions  and amortization and impairments of purchased intangible assets 
we anticipate that it will be increasingly difficult to reduce manufacturing costs 
as a result of these and other factors  it may be difficult to maintain our gross profit percentage consistent with historical periods and it may decline in the future 
operating expenses our operating expenses are summarized in the following table dollars in millions operating expenses engineering and development sales and marketing general and administrative special charges total operating expenses percentage of net revenues engineering and development sales and marketing general and administrative special charges total operating expenses engineering and development 
engineering and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related employee benefit costs  service and material costs  occupancy and equipment costs and related computer support costs 
during fiscal  engineering and development expenses increased to million from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to a million increase in cash compensation and related employee benefit costs primarily due to an increase in headcount  partially offset by a million decrease in outside service costs related to new product development and a million decrease in stock based compensation 
during fiscal  engineering and development expenses increased to million from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to a million increase in stock based compensation  including million related to stock based awards issued to employees that joined qlogic in connection with the acquisition of netxen 
we believe continued investments in engineering and development activities are critical to achieving future design wins  expansion of our customer base and revenue growth opportunities 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related employee benefit costs  sales commissions  promotional activities and travel for sales and marketing personnel 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily due to a million increase in cash compensation and related employee benefit costs  primarily due to higher headcount and increased commissions  a million increase in outside services and a million increase in promotional costs  including the costs for certain sales and marketing programs 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in amortization of purchased intangible assets due to an intangible asset becoming fully amortized during fiscal sales and marketing expenses decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease in sales and marketing expenses was due primarily to a million decrease in promotional costs  including the costs for certain sales and marketing programs  and a million decrease in travel costs  both related to our cost cutting measures implemented in the second half of fiscal in addition  cash compensation and related employee benefit costs decreased by million  primarily due to decreased commissions as a result of lower revenues  amortization of purchased intangible assets decreased by million  due to an intangible asset becoming fully amortized during fiscal  and occupancy and related computer support costs decreased by million 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in stock based compensation expense 
we believe continued investments in our sales and marketing organizational infrastructure and related marketing programs are critical to the success of our strategy of expanding our customer base and enhancing relationships with our existing customers 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related employee benefit costs for executive  finance  accounting  human resources  legal and information technology personnel 
non compensation components of general and administrative expenses include accounting  legal and other professional fees  facilities expenses and other corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses were consistent at million for fiscal and general and administrative expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to a million increase in stock based compensation  including million related to stock based awards issued to employees that joined qlogic in connection with the acquisition of netxen 
special charges 
during fiscal  we recorded special charges of million consisting of exit costs associated with severance benefits for involuntarily terminated employees  primarily related to the consolidation of certain engineering functions 
during fiscal  we recorded special charges totaling million related to the consolidation of facilities and workforce reductions 
the special charges consisted primarily of million of exit costs related to facilities under non cancelable leases that we ceased using during fiscal and million of exit costs associated with severance benefits for involuntarily terminated employees 
during fiscal  we implemented a workforce reduction initiative  primarily in response to the macroeconomic environment  and recorded special charges totaling million 
the special charges consisted primarily of million of exit costs associated with severance benefits for the involuntarily terminated employees and costs related to a facility under a non cancelable lease that we ceased using during fiscal as of april   the unpaid exit costs totaled million and are expected to be paid over the terms of the related agreements through fiscal interest and other income  net components of our interest and other income  net  are as follows in millions interest income net gains on investment securities impairment of investment securities other interest income is earned on our portfolio of investment securities and cash equivalents 
the decrease in interest income for fiscal from fiscal and fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a decline in interest rates 
during fiscal  net gains on investment securities were million and included million of net gains on sales of available for sale securities and a million gain from distributions of our cost basis investments in a money market fund and an enhanced cash fund 
during fiscal  net gains on investment securities were million and included million of net gains on sales of available for sale securities  a million gain from distributions of our investments in a money market fund and an enhanced cash fund and million of net gains on trading securities 
we reviewed various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge related to our unrealized losses in available for sale securities  including the current financial and credit market environment  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer of the security  the magnitude of the loss compared to the cost of the investment  the length of time the investment had been in a loss position and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of market value 
based on this analysis  we determined that a portion of the unrealized losses for our portfolio of available for sale securities were other than temporary and recorded an impairment charge of million during fiscal in addition  during fiscal  we recorded million of impairment charges related to our cost basis investments in a money market fund and an enhanced cash fund 
income taxes our provision for income taxes is million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
our effective income tax rate was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to our foreign operations generating a higher portion of our taxable income  which is taxed at more favorable rates 
in addition  during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded million of third quarter specific income tax benefits related to the expiration of certain statutes of limitation  the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research tax credit and certain other items 
our fiscal annual effective tax rate was impacted by a million tax charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to an amendment of a technology license agreement with one of our international subsidiaries 
as a result of the amendment  we determined that all payment obligations under the license agreement had been satisfied 
we currently believe that our effective tax rate will approximate in fiscal our federal consolidated income tax returns for fiscal years and are currently under examination by the internal revenue service 
we do not believe that the results of these examinations will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
given the increased global scope of our operations  and the complexity of global tax and transfer pricing rules and regulations  it has become increasingly difficult to estimate earnings within each tax jurisdiction 
if actual earnings within each tax jurisdiction differ materially from our estimates  we may not achieve our expected effective tax rate 
additionally  our effective tax rate may be impacted by other items including the tax effects of acquisitions  newly enacted tax legislation  examinations by tax authorities  stock based compensation and uncertain tax positions 
liquidity and capital resources our combined balances of cash  cash equivalents and investment securities increased to million at april   from million at march  as of april  and march   our international subsidiaries held and  respectively  of our total cash  cash equivalents and investment securities 
these holdings by our international subsidiaries as of april  consisted primarily of debt securities due from us issuers  including the us government and related agencies  and us dollar denominated cash and money market funds 
certain foreign regulations could impact our ability to transfer funds to the united states 
additionally  should we decide to repatriate cash held outside of the united states  we may incur a significant tax obligation 
we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents  investment securities and expected cash flow from operations will provide sufficient funds to finance our operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  it is possible that we may need to supplement our existing sources of liquidity to finance our activities beyond the next twelve months or for the future acquisition of businesses  products or technologies and there can be no assurance that sources of liquidity will be available to us at that time 
cash provided by operating activities increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal operating cash flow for fiscal reflects our net income of million and net non cash expenses of million  partially offset by net cash used as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
the changes in operating assets and liabilities included a million decrease in accrued taxes and a million increase in inventories 
the decrease in accrued taxes was primarily due to the expiration of certain statutes of limitation  the retroactive reinstatement of the federal research tax credit and the timing of payment obligations 
the increase in inventories was primarily due to advanced purchases of silicon chips to maintain flexibility due to long lead times for these products 
operating cash flow for fiscal reflects our net income of million  net non cash expenses of million and net cash provided as a result of changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
the changes in operating assets and liabilities included a million decrease in inventories and an million increase in accrued taxes  partially offset by a million decrease in accrued compensation 
the decrease in inventories was primarily associated with the completion of a planned contract manufacturer transition in fiscal  which started in fiscal and resulted in higher inventory levels at the end of fiscal  and higher product shipments during the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the prior year 
the increase in accrued taxes was primarily due to the timing of expected payment obligations 
the decrease in accrued compensation was primarily related to decreased incentive compensation 
cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal and consisted primarily of million of net purchases of available for sale securities and million of purchases of property and equipment  partially offset by million of proceeds from redemptions of auction rate securities ars at par value 
cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal and consisted of million of purchases of property and equipment  million of net purchases of available for sale securities  and million for the acquisition of netxen net of cash acquired  partially offset by million of proceeds from redemptions of ars at par value and distributions totaling million from our cost basis investments in a money market fund and an enhanced cash fund 
as our business grows  we expect capital expenditures to increase in the future as we continue to invest in machinery and equipment  more costly engineering and production tools for new technologies  and enhancements to our corporate information technology infrastructure 
cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal and consisted of our purchase of million of common stock under our stock repurchase programs and million for minimum tax withholdings paid on behalf of employees for restricted stock units that vested during the year  partially offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock and excess tax benefits from stock based awards 
cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal and consisted of our purchase of million of common stock under our stock repurchase program  million for minimum tax withholdings paid on behalf of employees for restricted stock units that vested during the year and the repayment of a million line of credit assumed in the netxen acquisition  partially offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock and excess tax benefits from stock based awards 
since fiscal  we have had various stock repurchase programs that authorized the purchase of up to billion of our outstanding common stock  including a program approved in august authorizing the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock 
as of april   we had repurchased a total of million shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs for an aggregate purchase price of billion 
pursuant to the existing stock repurchase program  we are authorized to repurchase shares with an aggregate cost of up to million as of april  we have certain contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments in the form of non cancelable purchase orders to our suppliers and commitments under operating lease arrangements 
a summary of our contractual obligations as of april   and their impact on our cash flows in future fiscal years  is as follows thereafter total in millions operating leases non cancelable purchase obligations total the amount of unrecognized tax benefits  including related accrued interest and penalties  was million as of april  we are not able to provide a reasonable estimate of the timing of future tax payments related to these obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  including the current economic environment  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we believe the accounting policies described below to be our most critical accounting policies 
these accounting policies are affected significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when all of the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
for all sales  we use a binding purchase order or a signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
delivery occurs when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  in accordance with the terms specified in the arrangement with the customer 
the customer s obligation to pay and the payment terms are set at the time of delivery and are not dependent on the subsequent resale of our product 
however  certain of our sales are made to distributors under agreements that contain a limited right to return unsold product and price protection provisions 
these return rights and price protection provisions limit our ability to reasonably estimate product returns and the final price of the inventory sold to distributors 
as a result  the price to the customer is not fixed or determinable at the time products are delivered to distributors 
accordingly  we recognize revenue from these distributors based on the sell through method using inventory information provided by the distributor 
at times  we provide standard incentive programs to our customers 
we account for our competitive pricing incentives and rebates as a reduction of revenue in the period the related revenue is recorded based on the specific program criteria and historical experience 
in addition  we record provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for estimated product returns in the same period that revenue is recognized 
these provisions are based on historical experience as well as specifically identified product returns 
service and other revenue is recognized when earned and receipt is reasonably assured 
for those sales that include multiple deliverables  we allocate revenue based on the relative fair values of the individual components 
when more than one element  such as hardware and services  are contained in a single arrangement  we allocate revenue between the elements based on each element s relative fair value  provided that each element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting 
an item is considered a separate unit of accounting if it has value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
fair value is generally determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately 
in the absence of fair value for a delivered element  we allocate revenue first to the fair value of the undelivered elements and allocate the residual revenue to the delivered elements 
in the absence of fair value for an undelivered element  the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting  resulting in a deferral of revenue recognition for the delivered elements 
such deferred revenue is recognized over the service period or when all elements have been delivered 
we sell certain software products and related post contract customer support pcs 
we recognize revenue from software products when all of the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting accounts receivable is probable 
revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based upon vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the element 
vsoe of the fair value is based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately 
revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met for each element 
if we are unable to determine vsoe of fair value for an undelivered element  the entire amount of revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the service period or when all elements have been delivered 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense for all stock based awards made to employees and non employee directors  including stock options  restricted stock units and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan the espp  based on estimated fair values on the date of grant 
stock based compensation is recognized for the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on historical trends and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period for stock options and restricted stock units  and the offering period for the espp 
the determination of fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
in estimating expected stock price volatility  we use a combination of both historical volatility  calculated based on the daily closing prices of our common stock over a period equal to the expected term of the option  and implied volatility  utilizing market data of actively traded options on our common stock 
we believe that the historical volatility of the price of our common stock over the expected term of the option is a strong indicator of the expected future volatility 
we also believe that implied volatility takes into consideration market expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility 
accordingly  we believe a combination of both historical and implied volatility provides the best estimate of the future volatility of the market price of our common stock 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated fair value of stock based awards 
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return should be recognized in the first reporting period that it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained upon examination 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
previously recognized income tax positions that fail to meet the recognition threshold in a subsequent period are derecognized in that period 
differences between actual results and our assumptions  or changes in our assumptions in future periods  are recorded in the period they become known 
we record potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences using enacted statutory tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
temporary differences include the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
an adjustment to earnings would occur if we determine that we are able to realize a different amount of our deferred tax assets than currently expected 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to complex tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional liabilities or potentially to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
differences between actual results and our assumptions  or changes in our assumptions in future periods  are recorded in the period they become known 
investment securities investment securities include available for sale securities  trading securities and other investment securities 
our investment securities are classified in the consolidated balance sheets based on the nature of the security and the availability for use in current operations 
available for sale securities are recorded at fair value  based on quoted market prices or other observable inputs 
unrealized gains and losses  net of related income taxes  on available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income until realized 
trading securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses included in earnings and reported in interest and other income  net 
in the absence of quoted market prices for trading securities  we value these securities based on an income approach using an estimate of future cash flows 
other investment securities are accounted for under the cost method and recorded at the lower of fair value or cost 
we recognize an impairment charge on available for sale securities when the decline in the fair value of an investment below its cost basis is judged to be other than temporary 
if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss  we would recognize the entire impairment in earnings 
if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit loss  the other than temporary impairment is separated into a the amount representing the credit loss and b the amount related to all other factors 
the amount of the other than temporary impairment related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings 
the amount of the other than temporary impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income  net of applicable taxes 
significant judgment is required in determining the fair value of investment securities in inactive markets as well as determining when declines in fair value constitute an other than temporary impairment and the portion of any impairment that is due to a credit loss 
we consider various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge  including the current financial and credit market environment  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer of the security  the magnitude of the loss compared to the cost of the investment  the length of time the investment has been in a loss position and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of market value 
realized gains or losses are determined on a specific identification basis and reported in interest and other income  net  as incurred 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
we write down the carrying value of our inventory to estimated net realizable value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
these assumptions are based on economic conditions and trends both current and projected  anticipated customer demand and acceptance of our current products  expected future products and other assumptions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
once we write down the carrying value of inventory  a new cost basis is established 
subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in an increase in the newly established cost basis 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to intangible assets acquired  other than goodwill  impact the amount and timing of future amortization 
the amount assigned to in process research and development is capitalized and accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the underlying projects are completed or abandoned 
goodwill is not amortized but instead is tested at least annually for impairment  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment  by comparing the carrying value to the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned 
a two step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  goodwill is considered impaired and the loss is measured by performing step two 
under step two  the impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of goodwill 
we perform the annual test for impairment as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter 
during the annual goodwill impairment test in fiscal  we completed step one and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill since the fair value based on quoted market price of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
based on this impairment test  we believe that we have no at risk goodwill 
the initial recording and subsequent evaluation for impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets requires the use of significant management judgment regarding the forecasts of future operating results 
it is possible that our business plans may change and our estimates used may prove to be inaccurate 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than current estimates used  we could incur impairment charges 
long lived assets long lived assets  including property and equipment and purchased intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
significant judgment is required in determining whether a potential indicator of impairment of our long lived assets exists 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group 
if such an asset or asset group is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
estimating future net cash flows and determining proper asset groupings for the purpose of this impairment test requires the use of significant management judgment 
if our actual results  or estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than our current estimates  we could incur impairment charges
