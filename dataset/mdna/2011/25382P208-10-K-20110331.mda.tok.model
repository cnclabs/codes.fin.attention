current trends and recent developments for the company overview we supply technology based products utilizing our portable digital video and audio recording capabilities  primarily for the law enforcement and security industries 
we have the ability to integrate electronic  radio  computer  mechanical  and multi media technologies to create unique solutions to our customers requests 
we began shipping our flagship digital video mirror in march and enjoyed significant revenue growth until the fourth quarter we have developed additional products to complement our dvm and dvm in car video products 
in that respect  we launched the new dvm ultra product for motorcycles  atv s and marine use during the third quarter of  launched the firstvu body worn camera product during the fourth quarter  the laser ally speed detection system in the third quarter of and the thermal ally night vision system in the fourth quarter of we have additional research and development projects that we anticipate will result in several new products to be launched in we believe that the launch of these new products will help to diversify and increase our product offerings and we anticipate that such new products will result in increased revenues in the future 

back to toc we experienced a negative trend of operating losses in and for which we reported operating losses of  and  on revenues of  and  during and  respectively 
the following is a summary of our recent operating results on a quarterly basis for the three months ended december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  total revenue gross profit gross profit margin percentage total selling  general and administrative expenses operating income loss operating margin percentage net income loss our business is subject to substantial fluctuations on a quarterly basis as reflected in the significant variations in revenues and operating results in the above table 
these variations result from the timing of large individual orders particularly from international customers 
we incurred an operating loss during the fourth quarter of  on total revenues of  and during the third quarter of  on total revenues of  this reverses the positive trend of operating profits that we reported during the third and fourth quarters of our revenues in the third and fourth quarters of improved compared to the first and second quarters of while our selling  general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter were approximately the same as the second and third quarter  we experienced deterioration in our gross margins that did not permit us to cover our operating expenses  resulting in the quarterly losses 
our international revenues continue to be depressed in we shipped an international order for the new dvm product in excess of million during the fourth quarter  but we have had no similar shipments during any quarter of  which principally contributed to the lower than expected revenues in we expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in revenues in and beyond due to the timing of larger orders particularly from international customers 
for  we had budgeted selling  general and administrative expenses to be consistent with our overall expectation of revenues and operations on an annual rather than on a quarterly basis 
accordingly  we added new sales and marketing resources in order to increase long term revenue from our current product line  the new products recently launched firstvu  laser ally and thermal ally and the expected launch of the dvm event recorder in we have implemented general and administrative cost reduction and containment measures 
for we are focusing on increasing revenues and improving gross margins on sales 
we will however  continue to invest in research and development and sales and marketing resources 
we experienced a general increase in inventory levels during in anticipation of higher sales that did not materialize  in particular from international customers 

back to toc there have been a number of factors trends affecting our recent performance  which include we incurred a non cash charge of  in the fourth quarter related to an increase in the valuation reserve on deferred tax assets  which resulted in a net loss of  for the fourth quarter and was the primary reason for our annual net loss of  the economic recession and its effect on state and local governmental budgets in particular impacted our operating results in the first half of  causing us to incur operating losses 
law enforcement agencies are our primary customer and are typically funded through state and local tax roles 
the economy showed some improvement in the second half of  but the impact on state and local budgets was and is still uncertain at best 
despite this improvement and our ongoing cost reduction and containment efforts  we incurred additional losses in the third and fourth quarters of that placed us in a three year cumulative loss position for tax purposes at december  although we expect that general economic and business conditions will continue to improve in  we determined there was not sufficient positive evidence regarding our potential for future profits to outweigh the negative evidence of our cumulative losses under current accounting guidance 
therefore  we determined that our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets should be increased by  in the fourth quarter to  million to fully reserve our deferred tax assets at december  we expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance until we determine that we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to realize these assets 
to the extent we determine that the realization of some or all of these benefits is more likely than not  based upon expected future taxable income  a portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed 
such a reversal would be recorded as an income tax benefit and  for some portion related to deductions for stock option exercises  an increase in shareholders equity 
we experienced a decrease in revenues during due in part to the challenging economy  which has negatively impacted state  county and municipal budgets 
we expect that the current economic climate will continue to depress certain state and local tax bases  and continue to make a challenging business environment 
our objective is to improve our revenues  operating income and net income in over levels 
we believe that delays in the introduction of our dvm resulted in significant lost revenues in and contributed to our lower than expected revenues and operating losses in  along with the impact of the current economic recession 
large orders generally have long sales cycles and because of the delays incurred we were not able to compete for several large contracts in that required the specifications of the dvm  which adversely impacted our revenues in we believe that lower sales in are due in part to our inability to respond to bidding opportunities for the dvm during commercial deliveries of the dvm commenced in the second quarter  however  we experienced some negative customer reactions because of the delays in availability of the dvm and in particular delays in the availability of some of its advanced features 
we are hopeful that continued acceptance of the dvm will help to improve our revenues in over  despite the current weak economic recovery 
our gross profit on sales eroded to in the third quarter from in the second quarter and in the first quarter the gross margin erosion is primarily the result of higher costs on dvm systems sold with the wireless download module upgrade and the introduction of new products  in particular the dvm  and the phase out of our legacy dvm product 
in addition  while international revenues improved during the third quarter over the first two quarters  such sales are generally at lower gross margins than domestic sales 
we incurred production inefficiencies  engineering changes and rework that negatively affected our gross margin from the dvm product compared to the legacy dvm product series 
further in  we discontinued the production of the dvm legacy system  which was a mature product with comparatively higher margins 
we expect the pressure on gross margins to continue in as we launch new products 
to address this problem  we evaluated our supply chain to reduce costs for our raw materials and component parts 
we are implementing a specific plan in to improve gross margins through better outsourcing of our component parts in the future including foreign sources and reducing our production overhead costs through headcount and other cost reductions 
we are also experiencing increased price competition and pressure from certain of our competitors that has led to pricing discounts on larger contract opportunities 
we believe this pricing pressure will continue as our competitors attempt to regain market share and revive sales 

back to toc we believe that current and potential customers may be delaying or reducing the size of orders due to a number of factors  including budget reductions in order to preserve their currently available funding and budgets 
in light of the historically high levels of federal funding allocated to law enforcement under the american recovery and reinvestment act  the omnibus appropriations act of  and other programs  we are hopeful that law enforcement agencies may continue to have access to federal funding which has not been available to them in the past 
however  many of these funding programs require matching funds from the local agencies that continues to be difficult given the budget restrictions 
while such funding could have a positive impact on our revenues in the future  we cannot predict the amount of the funds that will be used for products such as ours or the timing of the release of such funds 
our international revenues were substantially less than expectation during  with total international revenues of  of total revenues compared to  of total revenues for during october  we received an order from turkey for dvm units valued in excess of million 
this order represented our largest single international or domestic order for and was shipped during the fourth quarter sales to certain countries that were strong revenue sources for us historically have been negatively impacted by political and social unrest  the economic recession and a weakening of their currency exchange rates versus the us dollar 
we have focused on our international business by hiring an international sales manager in january  hiring a european based sales manager in november  and appointing international distributors in eight new countries during we currently have international distributors representing our products worldwide 
we expect that the availability of the dvm will help to improve our international revenues 
we have built in capability to install a variety of language packs into our dvm system  which currently includes english  spanish  turkish and arabic  with additional languages to become available during the balance of we believe this language flexibility will be a positive in our efforts to improve future international sales 
during the fourth quarter  we commenced an initiative to reduce selling general and administrative costs sg a and improve gross margins to a point where we can achieve consistent profitability in at a level of revenue that approximates our domestic revenue of about million annually in dvm system sales to us law enforcement agencies 
in that regard  we undertook headcount reductions and other cost reduction and containment measures during late and early that yielded annualized cost reductions approximating million  including compensation reductions of approximately million annually and sg a cost reductions approximating million annually 
in addition  we are reorganizing our production and manufacturing operations by placing a greater emphasis upon contract manufacturers 
uncertainties regarding the size and timing of large international orders make it difficult for us to maintain efficient production and staffing levels if all orders are processed through our manufacturing facility in grain valley  missouri 
by outsourcing more of our production requirements to contract manufacturers  we believe that we can benefit from greater volume purchasing and production efficiencies  while at the same time reducing our fixed and semi fixed overhead costs 
it is  of course  important that selected contract manufacturers be able to ramp up production quickly in order to meet the varying demands of our international customers 
our recent operating losses and increases in inventory levels caused deterioration in our cash levels and liquidity in and our liquidity decreased during  as our inventory balances increased and we repurchased approximately  of our common shares under our stock repurchase program 
we had borrowed  under our line of credit as of december   which leaves limited or no available future borrowings under our credit facility as of december  at such date  we have approximately million in working capital primarily in the form of inventory and accounts receivable 
we are focusing on reducing inventory and accounts receivable levels to generate additional liquidity and improve our cash position during our line of credit facility  as amended  allows us to borrow up to  on a revolving basis 
we had borrowed million as of december  giving us limited or no availability for future borrowings 
the current line of credit facility  as amended  requires us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth of million until its maturity date in june we had tangible net worth in excess of million at december  if we do not regain profitability and operating losses continue  we may be at risk of not meeting such requirement 
if we do not maintain the required tangible net worth  the bank would have the discretion to discontinue any advances otherwise available under the credit facility 
we do not believe that the bank will extend or renew the facility under terms that are mutually agreeable upon the facility s maturity 
we also believe that it is unlikely that we will be able to retire the existing borrowings at maturity in june without having a replacement credit facility in place unless our efforts to reduce our inventory and increase cash flow are successful 
we are in discussions with various financial institutions and third parties with the goal of obtaining a replacement credit facility 
however  it will be difficult to replace the existing line of credit facility given our recent operating losses and the current banking environment which may result in reduced growth prospects and profitability 
further  any new credit facility may not be on terms favorable to us 

back to toc we do not consider raising capital through an equity offering to be a viable alternative to supplement working capital needs  given our current public equity valuation 
however  we may find it necessary to raise additional capital if we do not regain profitability during  are unable to improve liquidity through a reduction in our inventory and accounts receivable levels in the near term and do not have other means to retire our credit facility 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet debt nor did we have any transactions  arrangements  obligations including contingent obligations or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or other persons that may have material current or future effect on financial conditions  changes in the financial conditions  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  capital resources  or significant components of revenue or expenses 
we are a party to operating leases and license agreements that represent commitments for future payments described in note to our consolidated financial statements and we have issued purchase orders in the ordinary course of business that represent commitments to future payments for goods and services 
we are contingently liable as of december  for standby letters of credit issued by our bank for an aggregate amount of  to certain customers as security if we do not honor our contractual warranty obligations on the products delivered to such customers 
the outstanding standby letters expire in march we have never had a beneficiary demand funding related to such standby letters of credit 
we entered into a supply and distribution agreement on may  under which we were granted the exclusive worldwide right to sell and distribute the laser ally  a proprietary law enforcement speed measurement device to our customers 
the initial term of the agreement is months after the date the supplier begins full scale production of the product 
full scale production commenced in august and final certification of the product was obtained 
after the initial term expires  the parties may continue on a month to month basis and the agreement is terminable by either party upon thirty days advance notice 
the contract may be terminated earlier in case of material breach by either party that is not cured within thirty days of notice of the breach 
the agreement contains required minimum order quantities and fixed prices per unit according to the following schedule minimum order commitment amount in dollars commitment time period original commitment purchases remaining commitment august through february march through february march through february

back to toc revenues our current product offerings include the following product description retail price dvm an in car digital audio video system that is integrated into a rear view mirror 
we sold our remaining inventory of this product as of december  and replaced it with the dvm plus model 
dvm plus an in car digital audio video system that is integrated into a rear view mirror 
dvm ultra an all weather mobile digital audio video system that is designed for motorcycle  atv and boat users 
dvm an in car digital audio video system that is integrated into a rear view mirror 
dvf a digital audio video system that is integrated into a law enforcement style flashlight 
firstvu a body worn digital audio video camera system 
laser ally a hand held mobile speed detection and measurement device that uses light beams rather than sound waves to measure the speed of vehicles 
thermal ally a hand held thermal imaging camera that improves night vision or other low light situations 
we sell through two separate channels sales to domestic customers are generally made direct to the end customer typically a law enforcement agency through commissioned third party sales agents 
revenue is recorded when the product is shipped to the end customer 
sales to international customers are generally made through independent distributors who purchase products from us at a wholesale price and sell to the end user typically law enforcement agencies at a retail price 
the international distributor retains the margin as its compensation 
the international distributor maintains product inventory  customer receivables and all related risks and rewards of ownership 
revenue is recorded when products are shipped to the international distributor consistent with the terms of the distribution agreement 
occasionally  we contract directly with the foreign customer for the sale of product and pay commissions to the distributor responsible for the sale 
we may discount our prices on specific orders when considering the size of the order  the specific customer and the competitive landscape 
we believe that our systems are cost competitive compared to our primary competition and generally are lower priced when considering comparable features and capabilities 
we sold a total of  and  dvm units during the years ended december  and  respectively 
our dvm and dvm plus models on a combined basis represented approximately and of total unit sales during the years ended december  and  respectively 

back to toc revenues for the year ended december  and were  and  respectively  a decrease of   due to the following factors we experienced a decrease in revenues due to the challenging economy that negatively impacted state  county and municipal budgets 
we believe that current and potential customers may have delayed or reduced the size of their orders due to a number of factors  including their local budget reductions and anticipation of receiving the federal government s stimulus funds in order to preserve their currently available funding and budgets 
our average order size decreased from approximately  in fiscal to  during fiscal we shipped individual orders in excess of  each for an aggregate of million in revenue in compared to orders individually in excess of  for total revenue aggregate of approximately million in we believe that this reflects reduced law enforcement budgets where the customers are covering only the minimum required needs rather than full fleet deployments 
in addition  the new products we introduced in firstvu  laser ally and thermal ally  all of which have lower average selling prices than our digital video mirror lines 
we are hopeful that will see an easing of such budgetary constraints and that a normal purchasing pattern will resume  although we can make no assurances in this regard 
our international revenues decreased substantially to  representing of total revenues during fiscal compared to  representing of total revenues during fiscal sales to certain countries that were strong revenue sources for us on an historical basis were negatively impacted by political and social unrest  economic recession and a weakening of their currency exchange rate versus the us dollar 
we have focused on improving our international business by hiring an international sales manager in january  hiring a salesman to cover europe and the middle east territories and appointing international distribution agents in eight new countries since january   which brings our total to agents representing our products in countries throughout the world 
we experienced an increase in inquiries and bid activity from international customers in  however  international sale cycles generally take longer than domestic business 
during october  we were awarded a million plus contract for our dvm product from a customer in turkey that shipped in the fourth quarter we are reevaluating our international sales structure in light of our initiative to reduce sg a expense and may make some adjustments in this area during we maintained consistent retail pricing on our dvm models during and do not plan any material changes in pricing during for the dvm product series or the new products recently introduced 
our newer mirror based products include the dvm ultra model and the dvm  which will be sold at higher retail pricing levels compared to the legacy products during due to increased features 
cost of revenue cost of revenue on units sold for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively  an increase of  
the increase in costs of goods sold is primarily due to an increase in the cost of goods sold as a percent of revenues offset by a decrease in revenues 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased to during the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  our goal is to reduce cost of sales as a percentage of revenues to during and beyond 
the cost of our wireless transfer modules wtms substantially increased our cost of sales during as we upgraded many existing and new customers to our new wtm upgrade  which was substantially more costly than our previous solution 
we were unable to pass the increased cost on to our customers for this wtm upgrade which negatively impacted our cost of sales 
our manufacturing overhead rates also increased during  primarily due to higher than anticipated rework rates on our dvm products resulting from engineering changes to add or upgrade features 
improving gross margins through reductions in conversion costs engineering changes and rework and manufacturing inefficiencies related to our new products such as the dvm and dvm plus are main focuses of management and engineering at the current time 
in addition  we are reorganizing our production and manufacturing operations by placing a greater emphasis upon contract manufacturers  including those located offshore 
uncertainties regarding the size and timing of large international orders make it difficult for us to maintain efficient production and staffing levels if all orders are processed through our manufacturing facility in grain valley  missouri 
by outsourcing more of our production requirements to contract manufacturers  we believe that we can benefit from greater volume purchasing and production efficiencies  while at the same time reducing our fixed and semi fixed overhead costs 
we believe that the selected contract manufacturers will be able to ramp up production quickly in order to meet the varying demands of our international customers 
we expect that our new product offerings during will likely continue to negatively impact our cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales 
we do not expect to incur significant capital expenditures to ramp up production of the new products because our internal process is largely assembling subcomponents  testing and shipping of completed products or we use contract manufacturers 
we rely on our subcontractors to produce finished circuit boards that represent the primary components in our products  thereby reducing our need to purchase capital equipment 
however  we will need to acquire test and calibration equipment to ensure that the completed products meet our specifications and requirements  which we expect will cost less than  
back to toc we had  and  in reserves for obsolete and excess inventories at december  and december   respectively 
we have no remaining units of the legacy dvm units in finished goods at december  and have discontinued it 
component parts specific to the dvm remain in inventory at levels that are expected to be consumed for service and repair demands 
total raw materials and component parts were  and  at december  and december   respectively  an increase of  
our initiative to improve gross margins includes the outsourcing of certain subcomponents to lower cost contract manufacturers 
in order to expedite the outsourcing of these subcomponents we acquired safety stock of certain long lead parts during to reduce our risk of supply shortages in to meet increases in customer demand 
the increase in raw materials and component parts reflect the procurement of this safety stock for our new contract manufacturers as they start initial production of our component parts 
the sale of this long lead material at break even or losses contributed to the increase in cost of sales as a percent of revenues during  however  we believe that introduction of these new suppliers to our supply chain will help reduce cost of sales as a percent of revenues in finished goods balances were  and  at december  and december   respectively 
the increase in finished goods was primarily in the dvm and dvm plus products  as our shipments in were significantly less than expected  particularly for our international customers 
these finished dvm units will be used to fulfill international and domestic orders during the first and second quarters of finished goods also increased as we maintained supplies of our new products including the firstvu  thermal ally and laser ally at december  we believe that our obsolescence risk was less at december  compared to december  because we have no remaining dvm legacy systems in finished goods inventory and the overall increase in our reserve for obsolete inventory 
we believe these reserves are appropriate given our inventory levels at december  and the new product introductions that we anticipate during gross profit gross profit for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively  a decrease of  
the significant decrease is commensurate with the decline in revenues and increase in cost of revenues as a percent of sales that we experienced during the year ended december  our gross profit percentage decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  we expect that our margins will be lower than normal on revenues contributed by our new products as we bring these products into commercial production during however  as revenues increase from these products  we will seek to improve our margins from these new products through economies of scale and more effectively utilizing fixed manufacturing overhead components 
we plan to concentrate on more efficient management of our supply chain through outsourcing production  quantity purchases and more effective purchasing practices 
we expect an improvement in our gross margin percentage for compared to as a result of our manufacturing overhead reduction  cost containment and increased outsourcing to contract manufacturers initiatives offset by the impact of our new product offerings 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of  
overall selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to in compared to in the significant components of selling  general and administrative expenses are as follows year ended december  research and development expense selling  advertising and promotional expense stock based compensation expense charge related to purchase and cancellation of employee stock options vendor settlements and credits professional fees and expense executive  sales and administrative staff payroll other total 
back to toc research and development expense 
we continue to focus on bringing new products to market  including updates and improvements to current products 
our research and development expenses totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  
the decrease from levels was attributable primarily to efforts early in to complete the dvm product  which was plagued by delays and cost overruns that contributed to higher research and development expense levels during we believe that our cost trends have improved substantially starting in the second quarter and continuing through because of our cost containment efforts and increased scrutiny of engineering resources by our vice president of engineering who was hired in april he has effected changes to improve the efficiency and cost effective usage of engineering resources in the development of our new products  in particular the dvm  dvm event recorder and the firstvu 
his efforts have also greatly improved the development cycle and costs associated with our new products  including line extensions for our current products that we plan to bring to market in the future 
we employed a total of engineers at december   most of whom are dedicated to research and development activities for new products 
research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues were in and  illustrating our commitment to bringing new products to market and expanding our current product line 
we have active research and development projects on several new products designed for the school bus  mass transit  taxi cab  law enforcement and other markets  as well as upgrades to our existing product lines 
our research and development expenses were at elevated levels during because of the substantial delays in the launch of our dvm product as our engineers focused on initial production and other technical issues of the dvm product 
during the third quarter  we launched the dvm ultra and during the fourth quarter we launched the firstvu 
during the second quarter we introduced the laser ally hand held speed detection product and in the fourth quarter  we launched the thermal ally 
we plan to launch the dvm event recorder in the first quarter the dvm  firstvu and dvm products are the result of our current research and development efforts 
we purchase and resell the thermal ally and laser ally products under our name from third parties who developed them 
the number of engineers devoted to research and development activities is expected to decrease during because several of our development projects are now completed and the engineers necessary to support our dvm plus and dvm products decline 
we consider our research and development capabilities and new product focus to be a competitive advantage and will continue to invest in this area on a prudent basis 
selling  advertising and promotional expenses 
selling  advertising and promotional expense totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  which is commensurate with the decrease in revenues 
the largest component of selling  promotional and advertising expense is commissions paid to our independent agents that represent our sales force in the domestic market 
these agents generally receive a commission on sales ranging from to of the gross sales price to the end customer 
sales commissions totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of   which is commensurate with the sales decrease in compared to and the higher percentage of commissions paid on the million sales to the turkish national police in we accrued approximately  of commissions in related to such sale 
in addition  during and early incentives were paid to several sales agents in an attempt to improve sales in certain targeted markets 
these incentives were successful and resulted in sales during the year ended december   but were subject to reduced sales commission rates 
sales commissions as a percentage of overall sales improved to during the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  promotional and advertising expenses totaled  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december   an increase of  
the increase is attributable to marketing brochures and other marketing initiatives designed to help launch the firstvu  thermal ally and laser ally in we have increased our promotional and marketing efforts specifically on international customers in an attempt to restore our international revenues 
in addition  we have increased the number of trade shows attended during compared to  including both domestic and international venues 
we believe our increased presence at such trade shows will lead to higher revenues through new leads and product demonstrations 
stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of  
the increase was primarily attributable to the restricted stock grant to officers and directors in january with shorter vesting periods compared to the prior years stock option grants 
therefore amortization related to such restricted stock grants in january coupled with normal amortization of prior year stock option grants resulted in higher stock based compensation expense in the year ended december  compared to charge related to purchase and cancellation of employee stock options 
charges related to purchase and cancellation of employee stock options totaled and  for the years ended december  and  respectively a decrease of  
the decrease was attributable to the separation agreement entered into with our previous vice president of engineering and production  who resigned during april the separation agreement included a provision whereby the company repurchased all of his vested and unvested stock options 
as a result  all remaining unamortized stock compensation expense related to the unvested stock options was expensed immediately 
the one time charge totaled  and is included in charges related to purchase and cancellation of employee stock options for the year ended december  vendor settlements and credits 
we resolved a dispute with a vendor during august that resulted in an aggregate benefit to us of  we disputed the value of services and products delivered and invoiced to us 
the dispute was resolved through mediation prior to the filing of a lawsuit and resulted in us receiving a cash settlement of  plus the cancellation of  of account payables to this vendor 
we recognized an aggregate benefit of  during the year ended december   which was reflected as an offset to selling  general and administrative expenses 
no similar event occurred during the year ended december  professional fees and expense 
professional fees and expenses totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of  
professional fees during were related primarily to normal public company matters  intellectual property matters  the dehuff and z technologies  llc litigation matters 
the dehuff litigation was settled during for an immaterial amount 
the increase in professional fees and expenses is primarily attributable to legal research and consultation regarding several patents and trademarks that have been or may be filed on the company s new products and litigation expense 

back to toc executive  sales and administrative staff payroll 
executive  sales and administrative staff payroll expenses totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of  
this increase is attributable to increased payroll costs related to additional sales and marketing personnel  the vice president of strategic development hired in mid year and the restoration effective january   of the salary reduction voluntarily taken by officers and directors during we have hired seven additional technical support staff to handle field inquiries  wireless download and installation matters 
during november  we hired a salesperson to cover europe and the middle east 
all of the foregoing contributed to higher payroll costs in compared to other 
other selling  general and administrative expenses totaled  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of  
the increase in was primarily due to higher insurance and facility related expenses as we leased additional office space for our engineering department and increased travel costs related to our attendance at international and domestic trade shows offset by cost containment measures implemented that resulted in lower consulting and other sg a costs during we plan to continue our cost containment initiatives in and expect the improvement in our overhead costs will continue 
operating loss for the reasons previously stated  our operating loss was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a deterioration of  
operating loss as a percentage of revenues increased to in compared to in our goal is to achieve profitability during if our revenue and gross margins increase through the increased sales of our dvm  dvm  laser ally  thermal ally and firstvu products and we are successful with our previously announced sg a cost reduction and gross margin improvement initiatives 
the improvement in operating income is also dependent upon anticipated increases in funding to states  counties and municipalities from the federal stimulus funds  coupled with our continued monitoring and control over selling general and administrative expenses 
interest income interest income decreased to  in the year ended december  from  in the decrease in interest income was a result of our decreased average cash balances and significantly lower average interest rate earned on such balances during the year ended december  compared to interest expense we incurred interest expense of  in the year ended december  we have not had any short or long term interest bearing debt outstanding since may however  we did draw million on our line of credit agreement to fund our operating losses and the repurchase of  of common stock during the year ended december  the outstanding balance on our line of credit was million as of december  loss before income tax provision benefit as a result of the above  we reported a loss before income tax benefit of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a deterioration of  
income tax provision benefit our income tax provision benefit was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the year ended december   we recorded a provision for income taxes at an effective tax rate of compared to a benefit recorded at an effective rate of for we increased our valuation reserve on deferred tax assets by  in whereby we are now fully reserved due to our recent operating losses 
this was a non cash charge and was the primary reason for our increased effective tax rate for 
back to toc the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets totaled  and  as of december  and december   respectively 
we record the benefit we will derive in future accounting periods from tax losses and credits and deductible temporary differences as deferred tax assets  which are included in the caption deferred income taxes on our consolidated balance sheet 
in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  income taxes  we record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of our deferred tax assets if  based on all available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at december   we had recorded a valuation allowance of  based on our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets at that date 
at december   we assessed the realizability of our deferred tax assets and the amount of our valuation allowance 
we considered that business conditions had deteriorated late in and would likely continue to be weak through the first half of we also considered our cumulative profit over the previous three year period and our future profit potential 
based on our assessment of these and other relevant factors  we determined that there was not sufficient positive or negative evidence to warrant an increase or decrease in the amount of the valuation allowance and that a valuation allowance of  was appropriate at december  the economic recession and its effect on state and local governmental budgets in particular negatively impacted our performance in the first half of and we incurred operating losses during this period 
law enforcement agencies are our primary customer and are typically funded through state and local tax roles 
the economy showed improvement in the second half of  but the impact to state and local budgets was still uncertain at best 
despite the improvement in general economic conditions and our ongoing cost containment efforts  we incurred additional losses in the third and fourth quarters of that placed us in a three year cumulative loss position at december  although we expect that general economic and business conditions will likely continue to improve in  we determined there was not sufficient positive evidence regarding our potential for future profits to outweigh the negative evidence of our three year cumulative loss position under the guidance provided in asc therefore  we determined that our valuation allowance should be increased to  million to fully reserve our deferred tax assets at december  we expect to maintain a full valuation allowance until we determine that we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to realize these assets 
to the extent we determine that the realization of some or all of these benefits is more likely than not based upon expected future taxable income  a portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed 
such a reversal would be recorded as an income tax benefit and  for some portion related to deductions for stock option exercises  an increase in shareholders equity 
we had approximately  of net operating loss carryforwards and  of research and development tax credit carryforwards as of december  available to offset future net taxable income 
net loss as a result of the above  for the years ended december  and  we reported a net loss of  and  respectively  a deterioration of  
basic and diluted loss per share the basic and diluted loss per share was and for the years ended december   and  respectively  for the reasons previously noted 
all outstanding stock options were considered antidilutive and therefore excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share for the years ended december  and because of the net loss reported for each period 
liquidity and capital resources overall during  we principally funded our operations internally through cash flow from operations and available cash balances  however  in we found it necessary to draw million on our line of credit to supplement our cash needs 
the borrowings during were used primarily to fund treasury stock acquisitions and to cover operating losses and working capital needs in particular inventory purchases and the payment of accrued commissions 
our line of credit facility  as amended in march  allows us to borrow up to million on a revolving basis 
we had borrowed million under the facility as of december   which after consideration of the outstanding letters of credit  gives us limited or no availability for future borrowings 
the line of credit facility  as amended  requires us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth of million until its maturity date in june we had tangible net worth in excess of million at december  and if we do not regain profitability and operating losses continue  we may be at risk of not meeting such requirement 
if we do not maintain the required tangible net worth  the bank would have the discretion to discontinue any advances otherwise available under the credit facility 
in addition  the line of credit matures in june and we believe it is unlikely that our current bank will be willing to extend or renew the facility under terms that are mutually agreeable 
we believe that it is unlikely that we will be able to retire the existing borrowings at maturity in june without having a replacement credit facility in place 
we are in discussions with various financial institutions and third parties with the goal of obtaining a replacement credit facility 
however  it will be difficult to replace the existing line of credit facility given our recent operating losses and the current banking environment  which may result in reduced growth prospects and profitability 
any new credit facility may not be on terms favorable to us 
we intend to repay the facility through reduction of inventory and cash flow from operations  although there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
we do not consider raising capital through an equity offering to be a viable alternative to supplement working capital needs  given our current public equity valuation 
however  we may find it necessary to raise additional capital if we do not regain profitability during  are unable to improve liquidity through a reduction in our inventory and accounts receivable levels in the near term and have not retired our credit facility before its maturity date 

back to toc cash and cash equivalents balances as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents with an aggregate balance of  an increase from a balance of  at december  summarized immediately below and discussed in more detail in the subsequent subsections are the main elements of the  net increase in cash during the year ended december  operating activities  of net cash used in operating activities  primarily to fund an increase in inventory levels  a reduction in accrued expenses offset by collections of accounts receivables and an increase in accounts payable 
non cash charges to income  such as the deferred tax provision  depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation helped offset the net cash used in operating activities 
our cash flow from operating activities was also negatively affected by non cash deferred tax benefits during the period 
investing activities  of net cash used in investing activities  primarily to acquire equipment to expand our research  development and production capabilities  furniture and fixtures related to our new corporate offices and the costs to acquire patents on our proprietary technology utilized in our new products 
financing activities  of net cash provided by financing activities  representing borrowings under our letter of credit and the proceeds from the exercise of stock options offset by the purchase of treasury stock 
operating activities net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended december  compared to net cash used in operating activities of  for the year ended december   an improvement of  the improvement in cash flow from operations for was primarily the result of collections of accounts receivable  the deferred tax provision and increases in accounts payable offset by increases in our net losses  increased inventory levels and reduction in accrued expenses 
we anticipate that we will increase revenues  return to profitability and decrease our inventory levels during  thereby providing positive cash flows from operations 
investing activities cash used in investing activities was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in both and  we purchased production  research and development equipment and office furniture and fixtures to support our activities 
during  we leased additional office space which required expenditures for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
during and  we also incurred costs for patent applications on our proprietary technology utilized in our new products and included in intangible assets financing activities during the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was  which is attributable to net borrowings of  under our line of credit and proceeds received from the exercise of stock options offset by the purchase of treasury stock totaling  during  we purchased common shares held in treasury in the amount of  the net result of these activities was an increase in cash of  to  for the year ended december  commitments we had  of cash and cash equivalent balances and net positive working capital approximating million as of december  accounts receivable balances represented  of our net working capital at december  we had an outstanding receivable related to our turkish sale totaling  as of december   which was collected during the year ended december   providing significant liquidity 
we intend to collect our remaining outstanding receivables on a timely basis and reduce the overall level substantially during  which would help to provide positive cash flow to support our operations during inventory represented  of our net working capital at december  and finished goods represented  of total inventory 
we expect that finished goods will be converted to cash quickly when customer orders are received and shipments occur in we are actively managing the overall level of inventory and believe that such levels will be reduced during  which should provide additional cash flow to help support our operations during borrowings outstanding under our current line of credit are at million  which leaves limited or no further available borrowings as of december  furthermore  our current facility matures in june and we believe it is unlikely that the bank will be willing to extend or renew the facility under terms that are mutually agreeable 
we also believe that it is unlikely that we will be able to retire the existing borrowings at maturity in june without having a replacement credit facility in place 
it will be difficult to replace the existing line of credit facility given our recent operating losses and the current banking environment which may result in reduced growth prospects and profitability 
this represents a substantial commitment whereby we will have to pay off the existing borrowings prior to the expiration date of the credit facility 
we do not consider raising capital through an equity offering to be a viable alternative to supplement working capital needs  given our current public equity valuation 
however  we may find it necessary to raise additional capital if we do not regain profitability during  are unable to improve liquidity through a reduction in our inventory and accounts receivable levels in the near term and have not retired our credit facility on or before its maturity date 

back to toc capital expenditures 
we had no material commitments for capital expenditures at december  lease commitments 
we had several non cancelable long term operating lease agreements for office space and warehouse space 
the agreements expire at various dates through december we have also entered into month to month leases for equipment and facilities 
rent expense for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively  related to these leases 
the future minimum amounts due under the leases are as follows year ending december and thereafter license agreements 
we have several license agreements whereby we have been assigned the rights to certain licensed materials used in its products 
certain of these agreements require us to pay ongoing royalties based on the number of products shipped containing the licensed material on a quarterly basis 
royalty expense related to these agreements aggregated  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the following is a summary of our licenses as of december  license type effective date expiration date terms production software license agreement april  april  automatically renews for one year periods unless terminated by either party 
software sublicense agreement october  october  automatically renews for one year periods unless terminated by either party 
technology license agreement july  july  automatically renews for one year periods unless terminated by either party 
limited license agreement august  perpetual may be terminated by either party 
during april  we terminated two production license agreements  and terminated our production software license agreement  because of failure of the counter party to deliver the required materials  refusal to honor warranty provisions and other matters 
both of these terminations are in dispute and we have filed a lawsuit to enforce our rights and protect our interests pursuant to these agreements 
see litigation below 
supply and distribution agreements 
we entered into a supply and distribution agreement on may  under which we were granted the exclusive worldwide right to sell and distribute the laser ally  a proprietary law enforcement speed measurement device to our customers 
the initial term of the agreement is months after the date the supplier begins full scale production of the product 
full scale production commenced in august and final certification of the product was obtained 
after the initial term has expired  the parties may continue on a month to month basis and the agreement is terminable by either party upon thirty days advance notice 
the contract may be terminated earlier in case of material breach by either party that is not cured within thirty days of notice of the breach 
the agreement contains required minimum order quantities and fixed prices per unit according to the following schedule minimum order commitment amount in dollars commitment time period original commitment purchases remaining commitment august through february march through february march through february 
back to toc during the year ended december  we purchased  of the product in accordance with the supply and distribution agreement 
considering the purchases to date  our remaining obligation to purchase product for the period august through february is  as of december  the supplier is responsible for all warranty  damage or other claims  losses or liabilities related to the product and is obligated to defend and indemnify us from such risks 
litigation 
we are subject to various legal proceedings arising from normal business operations 
although there can be no assurances  based on the information currently available  management believes that it is probable that the ultimate outcome of each of the actions will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements 
however  an adverse outcome in certain of the actions could have a material adverse effect on the financial results in the period in which it is recorded 
on june   we filed suit against z technologies  llc z in federal court for the district of kansas claiming breach of a production software license agreement entered into during october and the rescission of a second limited license agreement entered into during january among various other claims  we have asserted that z failed to deliver the material required under the contracts  the product that was delivered by z is defective and or unusable and that the january contract should be rescinded and declared void  unenforceable and of no force or effect 
we paid license fees and made other payments to z totaling  to date under these contracts 
z has denied our claims and has filed counterclaims that allege we did not have the right to terminate the contracts and therefore z has been damaged for loss of profits and related damages 
discovery and depositions by both parties have commenced and no trial date has been set 
on october   the circuit court of jackson county  missouri awarded us an interlocutory judgment against a previous contract manufacturer for the company 
we have filed for and received a temporary restraining order in june that forbids the supplier from engaging in certain actions involving us 
the interlocutory judgment was entered in favor us against the supplier that in effect cancelled all purchase orders and confirmed that we have no further obligations  whether monetary or otherwise  to the supplier 
we recorded a benefit of approximately  during the three months ended december  representing the amount of unpaid invoices to the supplier which it is no longer obligated to pay 
we received a notice of the filing of bankruptcy under chapter effective october  by this supplier 
on may   the court granted a default judgment awarding us total damages and legal fees of  we will pursue collection from the bankruptcy estate and applicable insurance policies 
management believes that the ultimate collection of any award of damages over and above the  in unpaid invoices is uncertain at this time because of the current financial status of the supplier in the pending bankruptcy proceedings and the uncertainty of insurance coverage 
we have filed a garnishment claim against all insurance proceeds from policies issued and in force covering the contract manufacturer when these actions occurred 
we are also involved as a plaintiff and defendant in ordinary  routine litigation and administrative proceedings incidental to our business from time to time  including customer collections  vendor and employment related matters 
we believe the likely outcome of any other pending cases and proceedings will not be material to our business or our financial condition 
k plan 
in july  we amended and restated our k retirement savings plan 
the amended plan requires us to provide matching contributions for employees who elect to contribute up to of their compensation to the plan and matching contributions for employee s elective deferrals on the next of their contributions 
we have made matching contributions totaling  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
each participant is vested at all times in employee and employer matching contributions 
stock repurchase program 
during june  our board of directors approved a program that authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock in the open market  or in privately negotiated transactions  through july  our board of directors approved an extension of this program to july  the repurchases  if and when made  will be subject to market conditions  applicable rules of the securities and exchange commission and other factors 
the repurchase program will be funded using a portion of cash and cash equivalents  along with cash flow from operations 
purchases may be commenced  suspended or discontinued at any time 
we purchased  shares under this program for a total cost of  average cost of per share during the year ended december  we have repurchased  shares at a total cost of  average cost of per share under this program from inception to december  standby letters of credit 
we are contingently liable as of december  for standby letters of credit issued by our bank for an aggregate amount of  to certain customers as security if we do not honor our contractual warranty obligations on the products delivered to such customers 
the outstanding standby letters expire in march we have never had a beneficiary demand funding related to such standby letters of credit 

back to toc critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in item  financial statements  of this report 
while the selection and application of any accounting policy may involve some level of subjective judgments and estimates  we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to our financial statements  potentially involve the most subjective judgments in their selection and application  and are the most susceptible to uncertainties and changing conditions revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts  allowance for excess and obsolete inventory  warranty reserves  stock based compensation expense  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition allowances for doubtful accounts 
revenue is recognized for the shipment of products or delivery of service when all four of the following conditions are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
we review all significant  unusual or nonstandard shipments of product or delivery of services as a routine part of our accounting and financial reporting process to determine compliance with these requirements 
our primary customers are state  local and federal law enforcement agencies  which historically have been low risks for uncollectible accounts 
however  we do have commercial customers and international distributors that present a greater risk for uncollectible accounts than such law enforcement customers and we consider a specific reserve for bad debts based on their individual circumstances 
our historical bad debts have been negligible with less than  charged off as uncollectible on cumulative revenues of million since we commenced deliveries during as of december  and december   we have a recorded a reserve for doubtful accounts of we periodically perform a specific review of significant individual receivables outstanding for risk of loss due to uncollectibility 
based on our specific review  we consider our reserve for doubtful accounts to be adequate as of december  however  should the balance due from any significant customer ultimately become uncollectible then our allowance for bad debts will not be sufficient to cover the charge off and we will be required to record additional bad debt expense in our statement of operations 
allowance for excess and obsolete inventory 
we record valuation reserves on our inventory for estimated excess or obsolete inventory items 
the amount of the reserve is equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
on a quarterly basis  management performs an analysis of the underlying inventory to identify reserves needed for excess and obsolescence 
management uses its best judgment to estimate appropriate reserves based on this analysis 
in addition  we adjust the carrying value of inventory if the current market value of that inventory is below its cost 
inventories consisted of the following at december  and december  december  december  raw material and component parts work in process finished goods subtotal reserve for excess and obsolete inventory total 
back to toc we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive delivery performance to our customers against the risk of inventory obsolescence due to changing technology and customer requirements 
as reflected above  our inventory reserves represented of the gross inventory balance at december   compared to of the gross inventory balance at december  our finished goods are composed primarily of our new dvm system  the dvm plus  the firstvu  the laser ally  the thermal ally and the dvf flashlight products which are not considered excess or obsolete 
we have reduced the finished goods inventory related to the legacy dvm system to zero as of december  and therefore it does not represent an obsolescence risk 
raw material and component part inventory balances were increased at december   compared to december   as we carried supplies of our new products introduced in in we are focused on outsourcing more component part production and increasing our efforts to carry efficient levels of raw materials and component parts commensurate with current sales forecasts 
we will continue our efforts to reduce overall inventory levels during the level of finished goods at december  was increased because of two primary factors we launched the dvm ultra and firstvu products during late and the thermal ally and laser ally during  which requires us to maintain additional finished goods inventory to meet expected demands for these new products  and we produced additional dvm units in order to accommodate several expected orders that did not materialize prior to december  we have inventory reserves for pending changes to the product line  engineering upgrades and design changes that alter the demand for component parts and a shift of production to outsourcing 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management or significant engineering changes to our products that are not anticipated and appropriately managed  additional inventory write downs may be required in excess of the inventory reserves already established 
warranty reserves 
we generally provide a two year parts and labor warranty on our products to our customers 
provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranties are made at the time products are sold 
these estimates are established using historical information on the nature  frequency  and average cost of claims 
we actively study trends of claims and take action to improve product quality and minimize claims 
our warranty reserves were decreased to  as of december  compared to  as of december   which reflects the decreased number of units under warranty 
our new dvm product failure rate has improved significantly during  which has contributed to the relatively stable level of warranty reserves 
we are introducing several new products  including the firstvu  laser ally  and thermal ally  during for which we have limited exposure since the third party manufacturers of these products are responsible for all warranty claims 
there is a risk that we will have higher warranty claim frequency rates and average cost of claims than our history has indicated on our legacy mirror products 
actual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods 
stock based compensation expense 
we grant stock options to our employees and directors and such benefits provided are share based payment awards which require us to make significant estimates related to determining the value of our share based compensation 
our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on historical volatilities of the underlying stock which are obtained from public data sources 
there were  options granted during the year ended december  the assumptions used for the determining the grant date fair value of options granted during the year ended december  are reflected in the following table year ended december  expected term of the options in years years expected volatility of company stock expected dividends none risk free interest rate expected forfeiture rate if factors change and we develop different assumptions in future periods  the compensation expense that we record in the future may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
there is a high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation 
changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect our estimates of fair values of our share based compensation 
certain share based payment awards  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  values may be realized from these instruments that are significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
although the fair value of employee share based awards is determined using an established option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 

back to toc in addition  we are required to net estimated forfeitures against compensation expense 
this requires us to estimate the number of awards that will be forfeited prior to vesting 
if actual forfeitures in future periods are different than our initial estimate  the compensation expense that we ultimately record may differ significantly from what was originally estimated 
the estimated forfeiture rate for unvested options outstanding as of december  range from to accounting for income taxes 
accounting for income taxes requires significant estimates and judgments on the part of management 
such estimates and judgments include  but are not limited to  the effective tax rate anticipated to apply to tax differences that are expected to reverse in the future  the sufficiency of taxable income in future periods to realize the benefits of net deferred tax assets and net operating losses currently recorded and the likelihood that tax positions taken in tax returns will be sustained on audit 
as required by authoritative guidance  we record deferred tax assets or liabilities based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
authoritative guidance also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as of december   cumulative valuation allowances in the amount of  were recorded in connection with the net deferred income tax assets 
based on a review of our deferred tax assets and recent operating performance  we determined that our valuation allowance should be increased to  to fully reserve our deferred tax assets at december  we expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance until we determine that we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to realize these assets 
to the extent we determine that the realization of some or all of these benefits is more likely than not based upon expected future taxable income  a portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed 
such a reversal would be recorded as an income tax benefit and  for some portion related to deductions for stock option exercises  an increase in shareholders equity 
as required by authoritative guidance  we have performed a comprehensive review of our portfolio of uncertain tax positions in accordance with recognition standards established by the fasb  an uncertain tax position represents the company s expected treatment of a tax position taken in a filed tax return  or planned to be taken in a future tax return  that has not been reflected in measuring income tax expense for financial reporting purposes 
we have no recorded liability as of december  representing uncertain tax positions 
we have generated substantial deferred income tax assets related to our operations primarily from the charge to compensation expense taken for stock options  certain tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards 
for us to realize the income tax benefit of these assets  we must generate sufficient taxable income in future periods when such deductions are allowed for income tax purposes 
in some cases where deferred taxes were the result of compensation expense recognized on stock options  our ability to realize the income tax benefit of these assets is also dependent on our share price increasing to a point where these options have intrinsic value at least equal to the grant date fair value and are exercised 
in assessing whether a valuation allowance is needed in connection with our deferred income tax assets  we have evaluated our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to utilize the benefit of the deferred income tax assets 
we continue to evaluate our ability to use recorded deferred income tax asset balances 
if we fail to generate taxable income for financial reporting in future years  no additional tax benefit would be recognized for those losses  since we will not have accumulated enough positive evidence to support our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards in the future 
therefore we may be required to increase our valuation allowance in future periods should our assumptions regarding the generation of future taxable income not be realized 
inflation and seasonality inflation has not materially affected us during the past fiscal year 
we do not believe that our business is seasonal in nature however  generally we generate higher revenues during the second half of the calendar year compared to the first half
