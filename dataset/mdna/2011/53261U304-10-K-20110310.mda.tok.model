item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that are based on management s current expectation  estimates  and projections about our business and operations 
our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward looking statements as a result of numerous factors  including those we discuss under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
we have included a discussion of our acquisition of aem in june in certain portions of the following discussion and analysis section in order to provide some detail on the impact that this transaction has had and that we expect that this transaction will have on our results of operations and liquidity and capital resource requirements 
the unaudited pro forma financial and operational information included herein for the twelve months ended december  have been presented as if the aem acquisition occurred on january  such unaudited pro forma information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what our actual financial or operational results would have been had the aem acquisition been consummated on such date 
overview general we are a provider of integrated energy engineering  consulting and implementation solutions focused on assisting our clients in the achievement of their energy efficiency goals 
we operate in three specific markets the commercial and industrial market  the public sector market  and the utility markets 
we perform energy efficiency engineering and consulting as well as the development and implementation of energy efficient lighting  mechanical  electrical  water  weatherization  and renewable energy solutions 
we serve a wide range of commercial and industrial  public sector and utility clients 
our commercial and industrial clients include many fortune companies for which we provide our energy efficiency solutions directly 
we also work for a number of utilities for which we manage or operate under their energy demand side management programs 
our public sector clients include federal  state and local government agencies and educational institutions  which we serve through our relationships with escos and directly 
escos are awarded project contracts with the public sector  and we provide energy efficiency expertise to develop and implement tailored solutions under these contracts 
in addition we also work directly for public sector clients when the services of an esco are not required 
our revenue increased by million  or  to million during from million during we have invested significant capital and resources to build our business infrastructure to provide us with the operational platform to support continued future growth 
the services we provide include energy engineering and consulting we apply our engineering expertise to analyze each client s energy consumption and operational needs and develop customized energy efficiency and renewable energy solutions 
our energy engineering and consulting services include sustainability consulting  energy auditing  energy master planning  project development services  design engineering and facility retro commissioning 
we also provide design review and analysis of new construction projects to maximize energy efficiency and sustainability  project management of energy related construction  and processing and p rocurement of incentive and rebate applications 

table of contents implementation we provide complete turnkey implementation services for a range of energy efficiency and renewable energy projects  including energy efficient lighting upgrades  energy efficiency mechanical and electrical retrofit and upgrade services  water conservation  weatherization and renewable project development and implementation  including solar  biomass and geothermal 
we consider factors such as current facility infrastructure  best available technologies  building environmental conditions  hours of operation  energy costs  available utility rebates a nd tax incentives  and installation  operation and maintenance costs of various efficiency alternatives 
our professionals extensive knowledge in energy efficiency solutions enables us to apply the most appropriate  effective and proven technologies available in the marketplace 
energy asset development and management we leverage our engineering and implementation capabilities and experience to provide energy asset development and management services to our clients who wish to benefit from alternative and or renewable energy sources 
in this role we serve two sets of clients the energy consumer and investors 
for the energy consumer  we perform project feasibility assessments  evaluate alternative technologies  estimate economic returns  arrange debt and equity financing  manage the design and construction process  and operate the asset under a long term power purchase agreement 
for our investor clients  we source  qualify and structure investment opportunities to maximize risk adjusted returns  then manage the design and construction process and operate the assets under long term power purchase agreements 
in some limited situations we take equity positions in these investments 
in august  we sold our energy technology segment through which we offered our patented line of hvac and lighting controllers under the emac and umac brand names 
the emac technology provides remote monitoring  management and control of commercial rooftop hvac units 
in early we decided to sell this division  which had incurred significant losses  to allow us to focus on our faster growing energy services business 
we came to agreement with a buyer in early august and closed on the sale on august  this segment has been reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
revenue and expense components revenue we generate the majority of our revenue from the sale of our services and the products that we purchase and resell to our clients 
revenue includes charges for our engineering  installation and or project management services and the materials we purchase and resell to our customers 
the substantial majority of our revenue is derived from fixed price contracts  although we occasionally bill on a time and materials basis 
under fixed price contracts  we bill our clients for each project once the project is completed or throughout the project as specified in the contract 
under time and materials arrangements  we bill our clients on an hourly basis with material costs and other reimbursable expenses passed through and recognized as revenue 
the time it takes to complete our projects ranges from less than a day for a small project under a utility program to four to eight months or longer for some of our larger projects 
our revenues are somewhat seasonal with the strongest sales occurring in the second half of the year 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize our revenue when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence has been received that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
in addition  we follow the provisions of the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which sets forth guidelines in the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payments and client acceptance 
any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue 
we recognize revenue under either the completed contract method  for short term contracts  or the percentage of completion method for multi month projects 
under the completed contract method  revenue is recognized once the project is substantially complete  resulting in some variability in revenue 
under the percentage of completion method we recognize revenue throughout the term of the project based on the percentage of costs incurred 
under both methods of revenue recognition  any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determinable 
revenue concentration during  niagara mohawk power corp 
aka national grid  a customer of our utility program management business  represented approximately of our consolidated revenue  while honeywell international  inc and johnson controls  inc  both escos  each accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue 
we have relationships with large escos that have historically provided repeat revenue and have represented a significant percentage of revenue in any given period 
we expect large esco projects to continue to be a significant component of our total revenue 
in addition  in late we began serving as program managers to some utilities 
these programs  like the one we have with national grid  have become significant contributors to our consolidated revenue and are expected to continue to be in future periods 
as a result  we may experience greater client concentration in future periods than we have in the past 
gross profit gross profit equals our revenue less cost of sales 
our cost of sales consists primarily of materials  our internal labor and the cost of subcontracted labor 
gross profit is a key metric that we use to examine our performance 
gross profit depends in part on the volume and mix of products and services that we sell during any given period 
a portion of our cost of sales  such as the cost of certain supervisory personnel  is relatively fixed 
accordingly  an increase in the volume of sales will generally result in an increase to our gross profit margins since these fixed expenses are not expected to increase proportionately with sales 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense includes the following components direct labor and commission costs related to our employee sales force  expenses related to our non production management  supervisory and staff salaries and employee benefits  including the costs of stock based compensation  commission costs related to our independent sales representatives  costs related to insurance  travel and entertainment  office supplies and utilities  costs related to marketing and advertising our products  
table of contents legal and accounting expenses  and costs related to administrative functions that serve to support our existing businesses  as well as to provide the infrastructure for future growth 
amortization of intangibles when we acquire other companies we are required to allocate the purchase price between identifiable tangible and intangible assets  with any remaining value allocated to goodwill 
the value allocated to intangible assets is amortized over the estimated life of the related asset 
the acquisitions we completed within  and resulted in approximately million of intangible assets that are being amortized over periods ranging from month to years 
approximately million of these assets were determined to have indefinite lives and were not being amortized 
we determined during that this indefinite lived asset  which was comprised of the parke trade name  was impaired due to our decision to operate all of our businesses under the lime energy name 
as a result  we incurred a one time  million non cash impairment charge during the fourth quarter of when we reduced this intangible asset s value to we recorded total amortization expense of  million and million in each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
based on the value of the intangible assets we are currently carrying  we expect to record amortization expense of  and  during and  respectively 
interest expense  net net interest expense consists of interest expense net of interest income 
net interest expense represents the interest costs associated with our subordinated convertible term notes including amortization of the related debt discount and issuance costs  our lines of credit  the mortgage on our headquarters building  the our term notes and various vehicle loans 
all of this debt  with the exception of the mortgage and vehicle loans  was repaid or converted to common stock upon the completion of our public offering in september interest income includes earnings on our invested cash balances and amortization of the discount on our long term receivables 
preferred stock dividends preferred stock dividends represent the dividend expense associated with our convertible preferred stock 
all of the convertible preferred stock was converted into common stock in august general business trends and recent developments the trends  events  and uncertainties set out in this section have been identified as those we believe are reasonably likely to materially affect the comparison of historical operating results reported in this report to either other past period results or to future operating results 
these trends  events and uncertainties include rapid growth in our utility and direct federal markets during we began marketing our services to two new markets the utility market and direct federal market 
while sales into these new markets did not contribute significantly to our consolidated results in  combined they represented more than of our consolidated revenue 
while our experience in both markets is still very limited  we believe that the combined effect of the growth in these markets is likely to contribute to a reduction in the seasonality of our revenue and that these businesses are likely to require less working capital to support a given amount of revenue when compared to that of our other markets 
the gross margin earned on sales to the direct federal market appears as though it will be much lower than the margins earned in other markets  but we believe this will be offset by lower 
table of contents sg a expense required to support sales in this market 
the gross margins earned in the utility market appear to be similar to those earned in some of our existing markets  but we believe the utility market will require less sg a expense to support a given level of revenue than required in these other markets 
the combination of these factors  as each of these markets continues to grow at different rates is likely to reduce the value of our historical results as an indicator of our future performance 
sale of energy technology division in may we added the emac and umac line of hvac and lighting controllers through the acquisition of maximum performance group  inc mpg 
this product line never reached the level of sales necessary to achieve profitability 
in march we made the decision to exit the business and retained an investment bank to assist us in locating potential buyers 
on august  we sold certain assets of this business  including the rights to the emac and umac technology 
the results of operations from the energy technology segment have been reported as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
during the quarter ended june   in anticipation of the sale  we reduced the carrying value of these assets to their expected fair value  incurring an impairment loss of  aem transaction on june   we acquired aem 
aem provides energy engineering and consulting services and energy efficiency services similar to our existing energy efficiency lighting solutions 
in addition  it provides mechanical and electrical conservation services  water conservation services and renewable energy solutions primarily for government and municipal facilities  all markets that we had not previously participated in 
at that time  the majority of aem s clients were escos and it operated primarily on the east coast 
because of the significance of this acquisition  our historical operating results prior to june are not expected to be indicative of our future operating results 
in particular  we expect our revenue and expenses to increase substantially as a result of this acquisition 
the following table reflects our historical operating results for selected in come statement line items for the year ended december   and the same line items on a pro forma basis assuming the aem acquisition and the related financing transactions occurred effective january  year ended december  pro forma actual un audited revenue cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative amortization of intangibles operating loss total other income expense loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations loss before income tax benefit income tax benefit net loss 
table of contents as a result of our acquisition of aem  our pro forma revenue and gross profit were higher than our actual revenue and gross profit and our pro forma sg a expense was higher than our actual sg a expense 
the higher pro forma sg a expense more than offset the higher gross profit  resulting in a pro forma operating loss that was greater than our actual operating loss 
due to the interest expense that we incurred in connection with our acquisition of aem  our pro forma net interest expense was higher than our actual net interest expense 
all of this contributed to a pro forma net loss that exceeded our actual net loss 
the acquisition of aem may reduce the seasonality of our consolidated revenue because aem derives the majority of its revenue from long term government contracts that are generally not seasonal in nature 
however  because a few large projects are often responsible for a significant portion of aem s annual revenue  the level of activity  initial project delays or gaps between projects can have a significant impact on the revenue and earnings of a particular period 
public offering on september   we completed an underwritten follow on public offering of our common stock  receiving  in gross proceeds less  in underwriters discount and offering costs of  on october   the underwriters exercised their overallotment and purchased an additional  shares at per share  less a discount of for total net proceeds to the company of  proceeds from the offering were used to repay a million line of credit and million in notes payable 
the balance of the proceeds are being used for other general corporate purposes 
zemel road transaction in october  we acquired the gas rights to the zemel road landfill in punta gorda  florida  for million with the intention of building a megawatt landfill gas to electricity generating facility on the site 
please see note in the accompanying financial statements for additional information regarding this investment 
we made this investment to establish ourselves in the asset development and management business and because we believe that this investment will generate consistent long term revenue and earnings and deliver a strong return to our stockholders 
however  going forward we plan to build this business as a developer and asset manager for third party investors and intend to limit our future investment in similar assets 
in this role we will earn fees for developing and managing assets owned by third party investors 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a d etailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting 
table of contents the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenues  bad debts  warranty accrual  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue and profit recognition we recognize our revenue when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence has been received that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
in addition  we follow the provisions of the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which sets forth guidelines in the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payments and client acceptance 
any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue 
historically  we have recognized revenue primarily on a completed contract basis 
under the completed contract method  revenue is recognized once the project is substantially complete  resulting in some variability in revenue 
this method works well with projects that are smaller and shorter in duration 
our public sector markets  however  recognize  and will continue to recognize  all of its revenue on a percentage of completion basis 
projects in our public sector market are generally larger in terms of revenue and longer in duration  therefore  we therefore recognize revenue throughout the term of the project on a completion method based on the percentage of costs incurred 
approximately half of our revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
under both methods of revenue recognition  any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determinable 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
the allowance is largely based upon specific knowledge of clients from whom collection is determined to be doubtful and our historical collection experience with such clients 
if the financial condition of our clients or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  or if our estimates of certain clients ability to pay are incorrect  additional allowances may be required 
during we increased our allowance by  and wrote off receivables of  as of december   our allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately  or of our outstanding accounts receivable 
amortization of intangibles we account for acquisitions of companies in accordance with the asc  accounting for business combinations 
we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and intangible assets based on their fair values  with the excess of purchase price being allocated to goodwill 
the determination of the fair values of these intangible assets is based on a number of significant assumptions as determined by us  including evaluations of the future income producing capabilities of these assets and related future expected cash flows or replacement cost of the asset 
we also make estimates about the useful lives of the acquired intangible assets 
should different conditions result in the determination that the value of the acquired intangible assets has been impaired  we could incur write downs of intangible assets  or changes in the estimation of useful lives of those i ntangible assets 
in accordance with asc  goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to annual impairment testing which is discussed in greater detail below 

table of contents intangible assets included acquired technology  customer and contractual relationships  client backlog  non competition agreements and trade names 
acquired technology was initially recorded at its fair value based on the estimated after tax cost to replace the asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life on a straight line basis 
customer and contractual relationships represent contractual and separable relationships that we have with certain customers and partners 
these contractual relationships were initially recorded at their fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows and are amortized over their estimated useful life 
non competition agreements were initially recorded based on the present value of potential profits that could be lost  should the individual initiate a competing enterprise  and are amortized over the minimum term of the no n competition agreements 
trade name intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value based on the present value of the royalty payments that would need to be paid for the development and use of a comparable trade name should the name be unavailable to us 
trade name intangible assets are deemed to have an indeterminate life and are not amortized 
impairment loss we evaluate all of our long lived assets  including intangible assets other than goodwill and fixed assets  periodically for impairment in accordance with asc  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
during  we determined that the parke trade n ame was impaired as a result of our decision to operate the business under the lime energy name 
as a result we incurred an impairment loss of million  net of the tax benefit  during the fourth quarter of goodwill we have made acquisitions in the past that included a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with asc  goodwill is subject to an annual or under certain circumstances more frequent impairment test based on its estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is less than value based on undiscounted operating earnings because fair value estimates include a discount factor in valuing future cash flows 
many assumptions and estimates underlie the determination of an impairment loss  including economic and competitive conditions  operating costs and efficiencies 
another estimate using different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
during the fourth quarter of we completed our analyses for the c i and aem reporting units and concluded that the implied fair value of the businesses based on the discounted current value of the estimated future cash flows substantially exceeded the carrying value  indicating that the goodwill was not impaired 
for the purposes of our analysis the aem reporting unit included the operations of our public sector market  which was the primary source of revenue for aem at the time of its acquisition  and utility management market  which we developed within aem utilizing the skills and experience of its management 

table of contents we considered various factors in determining the fair value of the testing units  including discounted cash flows from projected earnings  values for comparable companies and the market price of our common stock 
we will continue to monitor for any impairment indicators such as underperformance of projected earnings  net book value compared to market capitalization  declining stock price and significant adverse economic and industry trends 
in the event that either testing unit does not achieve projected results  or  as the result of changes in facts of circumstances  we could incur a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 
share based compensation we have stock incentive plans that provides for stock based employee and director compensation  including the granting of stock options and shares of restricted stock  to certain key employees and non employee directors 
these plans are more fully described in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
consistent with asc  share based payment  we record stock compensation expense for equity based awards granted  including stock options and restricted stock unit grants  over the service period of the equity based award based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant 
we recognized million  million and million of stock compensation related to employee options expense  employee stock purchase plan and restricted stock grants during  and  respectively 
results of operations revenue we generate the majority of our revenue from the sale of our services as well as the sale of the products that we purchase and resell to our clients 
all of our revenue is earned in the united states 
our revenue includes charges for our engineering  installation and or project management services and the materials we purchase and resell to our clients 
the substantial majority of our revenue is derived from fixed price contracts  although we occasionally bill on a time and materials basis 
under fixed price contracts  we bill our clients for each project once the project is completed or throughout the project as specified in the contract 
under time and materials arrangements  we bill our clients on an hourly basis with material costs and other reimbursable expenses passed through and recognized as revenue 
the time it takes to complete are projects range from less than one day for some of our utility program projects to eight months or more for some of our largest public sector projects 
gross profit gross profit equals our revenue less costs of sales 
the cost of sales consists primarily of materials  our internal labor  including engineering  and the cost of subcontracted labor 
gross profit is a key metric that we use to examine our performance 
gross profit depends in part on the volume and mix of products and services that we sell during any given period 
a portion of our expenses  such as the cost of certain salaried project management  are relatively fixed 
accordingly  an increase in the volume of sales will generally result in an increase to our margins since these fixed expenses are not expected to increase proportionately with sales 
our business is also seasonal  as such  our margins will vary with seasonal changes in our revenue due to the fixed nature of some of our costs 
the gross margin earned in our different markets varies  with our direct government market generating the lowest margins and our utility and c i markets generally earning the highest margins 
therefore the mix of business generated from our various markets  which wil l change throughout the year due in part to the seasonal nature of some of the markets  will affect our consolidated gross margin 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a include the following components direct labor and commission costs related to our employee sales force  costs of our non production management  supervisory and staff salaries and employee benefits  including the costs of stock based compensation  costs related to insurance  travel and entertainment  office supplies and utilities  costs related to marketing and advertising our products  legal and accounting expenses  and costs related to administrative functions that serve to support our existing businesses  as well as to provide the infrastructure for future growth 
amortization of intangibles we incur expenses related to the amortization of identifiable assets that we have capitalized in connection with our acquisitions 
other expense other expense consists of interest expense  net of interest earned on our investments 
interest expense represents the interest costs and fees associated with our subordinated convertible term notes including amortization of the related debt discount and issuance costs  our lines of credit  the mortgage on our headquarters building  notes payable and various vehicle loans 
interest income includes earnings on our invested cash balances and amortization of the discount on our long term receivables 
we offer certain customers extended payment terms 
when we record these receivables we are required to discount them using a market rate of interest and amortize the discount over the term of the receivable 
this amortization is recognized as interest income 
dividend expense dividend expense includes dividends accrued on our preferred stock and charges for non cash deemed dividends

table of contents revenue our revenue for the twelve month period ended december  increased million or  to million when compared to million earned for contributing to this increase was revenue generated by our utility program management business and frr contract 
both of these were new business initiatives we began in late and neither of them generated significant revenue during revenue generated by our c i and public sector markets were flat to down slightly during when compared to our c i markets were soft early in  as customers continued to appear reluctant to make significant expenditures 
however  conditions seemed to have improved later in the year resulting in strong fourth quarter sales  permitting this market s full year revenue to almost match results 
we believe that conditions in this market will continue to improve in and we expect a moderate increase in revenue for over levels 
our public sector markets were impacted early in by customer uncertainty regarding funding sources 
this situation was resolved by mid year and revenue for the third and fourth quarters of the year exceeded the levels earned during the same periods in however  poor weather during december in the northeast and midwest impacted several of our larger projects contributing to revenue for the full year falling short of the levels achieved during we believe that the recovery we experienced during the third and fourth quarters will continue into  resulting in revenue that is modestly higher than that earned during the continued growth of our two new business initiatives  in combination with expected contributions from our new asset development and management business and improving conditions in our c i and public sector markets  should result in additional growth in our consolidated revenue during revenue for is projected to continue to be unevenly distributed  with to of our revenue coming during the second half of the year 
gross profit our gross profit for was million  representing a million or increase over the million gross profit earned during our gross profit margin increased from during to for the increases in our gross profit and gross profit margin were the result of increased revenue  improvements in our operational efficiency in certain of our markets and a change in the mix of our business resulting from the growth of our utility program management business 
our public sector projects  large c i projects and projects under the frr contract typically carry lower margins than smaller c i and utility program projects 
however  these public sector  large c i projects and frr projects also typically have lower associated sg a expense per dollar of revenue 
we expect the margins to be generated by our new asset development and management business to exceed the consolidated margins we have earned historically  but this new business is not expected to contribute significant revenue during we believe that our consolidated gross margins will be flat to slightly higher during as the mix of business continues to shift such that the lower margin public sector projects become a smaller portion of our total revenue 
our gross margins will continue to vary throughout the year depending on the mix of revenue and ov erall revenue level  with the highest margins in the third and fourth quarters when revenues are expected to peak 

table of contents selling general administrative expense our selling  general and administrative expense increased million or  to million during the twelve month period ended december   when compared to million for the same period during all of the increase in our sg a expense was related to our three new business initiatives the utility program management business  the frr contract and the asset development and management business 
we started the utility program management business and won the frr contract late in  so neither of these businesses had significant expenses during we began the asset development and management business during and it had no expenses during we reduced our sg a expense during through realignment of resources and headcount reductions in areas that support our public sector and c i markets and in our corporate overhead 
as a result holding the growth in our sg a expense to while our revenue grew  our sg a expense as a percentage of revenue declined from in to during we expect our sg a expense to grow at a faster rate during than it did during as we incur a full year of expense associated with our new business initiatives  support continued growth in our new business initiatives and invest in a few key positions to strengthen our organization and diversify our public sector offerings 
while these investments in key hires are not expected to generate significant revenue during  we believe that they will result in greater revenue growth and profitability for the company over the next three to five years than we would experience without them 
although we anticipate the growth rate of our sg a expense to increase during  we continue to believe the growth in our revenue will outpace the growth in our sg a expense for at least the next several years  resulting in further reductions in our sg a as a percent of revenue 
amortization of intangibles amortization expense declined million to million in from million in amortization expense declined as certain intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions became fully amortized 
amortization expense will increase slightly during to approximately million as the result of amortization expense associated with the acquisition of the zemel road gas rights based on our expectation that the project will begin operating in late summer 
impairment loss during we determined that the parke trade name was impaired due to our decision to operate the business under the lime energy name 
as a result  we reduced the carrying value of this intangible asset to  incurring a million impairment loss during the fourth quarter of this loss was partially offset by the reversal of a million deferred tax liability associated with this indefinite lived asset  which was reported as an income tax benefit

these warrants were valued at  using a trinomial option pricing model and the value was recorded as a debt discount  which we began to amortize over the scheduled term of the facility 
we terminated the bridge line of credit in october following the completion of a follow on offering of common stock  at which time we expensed the remaining unamortized debt discount

table of contents revenue our consolidated revenue for the twelve month period ended december  increased million or over the million earned during the twelve month period ended in the increase was primarily due to the inclusion of a full twelve months of revenue from aem and increased revenue derived from our public sector markets 
revenue derived from our commercial and industrial markets was flat from the prior year 
our revenue increased million or when compared to our pro forma results for this increase again was the result of higher sales in our public sector markets 
uncertainty on the part of our commercial industrial c i customers related to the economy impacted our results in the c i market during revenue from our public sector customers was negatively impacted late in by delays and uncertainty related to the availability of funds under the american recovery and reinvestment act of commonly referred to as the stimulus 
gross profit our gross profit increased million or to million during from million during and million or from pro forma results

table of contents operating activities operating activities consumed million and million during and  respectively 
whether cash is consumed or generated by operating activities is a function of the profitability of our operations and changes in working capital 
to get a better understanding of cash sources and uses  management splits the cash used or provided by operating activities into two pieces the cash consumed or generated by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities  and the cash consumed or generated from changes in assets and liabilities 
by splitting the cash used or provided by operating activities this way our management believes it gets a better understanding of how much of our operating cash flow is the result of the company s current period cash earnings or loss and how much of our operating cash flow is due to changes in working capital 
these two measures are calculated as follows in thousands year ended year ended december  december  net loss provision for bad debt share based compensation preferred stock dividends depreciation and amortization amortization of deferred financing costs amortization of original issue discount issuance of warrants in exchange for services received beneficial value of change in conversion price of suborinated notes pik notes issued for interest accrued interest converted to common stock accrued interest converted to preferred stock loss on disposition of fixed assets trade name impairment impairment on disposal of energy technology business deferred income tax benefit cash consumed by operating activities before changes in assets and liabilities changes in assets and liabilities  net of business acquisitions and dispositions accounts receivable inventories costs in excess uncompleted contracts other current assets accounts payable accrued expenses billings in excess uncompleted contracts deferred revenue other current liabilities cash consumed from changes in assets and liabilities

this improvement was the result of improved profitability of our operations  reduction in our interest expense and elimination of our preferred stock dividend 
we anticipate additional improvements in this measure in future periods if we are able to continue to increase our revenue at a rate that exceeds the growth in our sg a expense  while keeping our gross margins relatively unchanged as we believe we can 
changes in assets and liabilities consumed million compared to consuming million during  representing a decline of million or 
our new business initiatives generally have lower working capital requirements than our existing businesses 
this  in combination with improvements in our receivables turnover at our existing businesses  was the primary contributors to the improvement in this measure 
we expect the changes in assets and liabilities to continue to consume cash in future periods if the company grows as we believe it will 
the rate of growth will depend in part on the rate of growth of our business  the mix of business from our various markets  the degree of seasonality we experience in future periods and our ability to continue to improve the turnover of our receivables

the completion of the zemel road generating facility during will consume approximately million  but we anticipate that this will be funded through a combination of long term financing and a us treasury grant 
other than this we do not expect a significant increase in the level of our capital purchases during

table of contents sources of liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are our available cash reserves  which were million on december  and availability under the million line of credit which we secured in march our ability to continue to expand the sales of our products and services will require the continued commitment of significant funds 
the actual timing and amount of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including the amount  timing and profitability of future revenues  working capital requirements  the level and amount of product marketing and sales efforts  among other things 
we have raised a significant amount of capital since our formation through the issuance of shares of our common and preferred stock and notes  which has allowed us to acquire companies and to continue to execute our business plan 
most of these funds have been consumed by operating activities  either to fund our losses or for working capital requirements 
while our operations generated positive cash flow during the second half of and positive earnings for the first time in our history during the fourth quarter of  we need to continue to focus on moving the company to the point that it is consistently generating positive earnings and cash flow 
to do this we believe that we need to continue to increase our revenue while controlling the growth of our sg a expense and maintaining or improving our gross margins 
we believe the strategies we have implemented ove r the past two years  which are in part reflected in our new business initiatives  have positioned us where this objective could be achieved within the next to months 
we believe that our current liquidity will be sufficient to permit us to continue to operate until we reach the point that we turn cash flow positive on a consistent basis
