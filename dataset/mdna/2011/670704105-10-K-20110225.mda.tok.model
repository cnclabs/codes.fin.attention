item business 
overview we are a medical device company focused on developing minimally disruptive surgical products and procedures for the spine 
our currently marketed product portfolio is focused on applications for spine fusion surgery  including biologics  a combined market estimated to exceed billion globally in our principal product offering includes a minimally disruptive surgical platform called maximum access surgery  or mas  as well as a growing offering of biologics  cervical and motion preservation products 
our spine surgery product line offerings  which include products for the thoracolumbar spine  the cervical spine  and a set of motion preservation product offerings still under development  are primarily used to enable access to the spine and to perform restorative and fusion procedures in a minimally disruptive fashion 
our biologic product line offerings include allograft donated human tissue  formagraft  a collagen synthetic product used to aid the fusion process  and osteocel plus  an allograft cellular matrix containing viable mesenchymal stem cells  or mscs  to aid in spinal fusion 
we focus significant research and development efforts to expand our mas product platform  advance the applications of our unique technology to additional procedures and develop motion preserving products such as our total disc replacement products 
we dedicate significant resources toward training spine surgeons on our unique technology and products 
currently  we are training over surgeons annually  which includes surgeons new to our mas product platform as well as surgeons previously trained on our mas product platform who are attending advanced training programs 
our mas platform combines four categories of our product offerings nv m and nv jjb our proprietary software driven nerve monitoring systems  maxcess a unique split blade design retraction system providing enhanced surgical access to the spine  biologics includes our formagraft and osteocel plus line of products  and specialized implants includes our spherx and armada tm pedicle screw systems  coroent suite of implants  and several fixation systems 

table of contents we believe our mas platform provides a unique and comprehensive solution for safe and reproducible minimally disruptive surgical treatment of spine disorders by enabling surgeons to access the spine in a manner that affords direct visualization and avoidance of critical nerves 
the fundamental difference between our mas platform and what has been previously named mis  or minimally invasive surgery  is the ability to customize safe and reproducible access to the spine while allowing surgeons to continue to use instruments that are familiar to them 
simply stated  the mas platform does not force surgeons to reinvent approaches that add complexity and undermine safety  ease and efficacy 
an important ongoing objective has been to maintain a leading position in access and nerve avoidance  as well as being the pioneer and ongoing leader in lateral surgery 
our mas platform  with the unique advantages provided by our nerve monitoring systems  enables an innovative lateral procedure known as extreme lateral interbody fusion  or xlif  in which surgeons access the spine for a fusion procedure from the side of the patient s body  rather than from the front or back 
our maxcess instruments provide access to the spine in a manner that affords direct visualization and our nerve monitoring systems allow surgeons to avoid critical nerves 
we believe that the procedures facilitated by our mas platform decrease trauma and blood loss  and lead to faster overall patient recovery times compared to open spine surgery 
in recent years  we have significantly expanded our product offering relating to procedures in the cervical spine as well as in the area of biologics 
our cervical product offering now provides a full set of solutions for cervical fusion surgery  including both allograft and coroent implants  as well as cervical plating and posterior fixation products 
in  we acquired cervitech  inc  a company focused on gaining regulatory approval of the pcm cervical disc system  a motion preserving total disc replacement device 
this strategic acquisition allows us the potential to accelerate our entry into the growing mechanical cervical disc replacement market 
in the first quarter of  we submitted a premarket approval pma application for us food and drug administration fda approval for the pcm cervical disc system 
approval  if obtained  would further strengthen our cervical product offering and should enable us to continue our trend of increasing our market share 
our biologic offering includes formagraft  a collagen synthetic bone substitute  and osteocel plus  an allograft cellular matrix designed to mimic the biologic profile of autograft that includes endogenous mesenchymal stem cells mscs and osteoprogenitors  both of which are used to aid in spinal fusion 
in  we invested in progentix orthobiology  bv  a company organized under the laws of the netherlands that is developing a synthetic bone graft material to aid in the healing and generation of human bone 
as part of the investment transaction  we became the exclusive distributor for certain progentix biologic products 
we are currently in the process of seeking regulatory clearance for attrax tm  a synthetic bone graft material being developed by progentix delivered in putty form 
our corporate headquarters are located in san diego  california 
we lease approximately  square feet in san diego 
our headquarters has a six suite state of the art cadaver operating theatre designed to accommodate the training of spine surgeons 
in we opened a secondary training facility in paramus  new jersey with a five suite operating theatre for surgeon training 
our primary distribution and warehousing operations are located in our facility in memphis  tennessee 
our business requires overnight delivery of products and surgical instruments for almost all surgeries involving our products 
because of its location and proximity to overnight third party transporters  our memphis facility has greatly enhanced our ability to meet demanding delivery schedules and provide a greater level of customer service 
recent product introductions in the last few years  we have introduced numerous new products and product enhancements that have significantly expanded our mas platform  enhanced the applications of the xlif procedure  expanded our offering of cervical products and moved us closer to entry into the growing motion preservation market 
we have also acquired complementary and strategic assets and technology  particularly in the area of biologics 
our newly launched and acquired products are highlighted by the following products implants our implant products  which include among other implants  the coroent family of products and our spherx and armada pedicle screw systems  have historically focused on the lumbar spine  with our recent and planned product introductions  such as vuepoint oct and thoracic xlif  we will increasingly address the cervical and thoracic spine as well 

table of contents nv m is  along with its predecessors  the enabling technology for the xlif procedure  and utilizes proprietary technology and software hunting algorithms to locate and avoid critical nerves during access for and completion of spine surgery 
nv m s name refers to five monitoring modalities  covering the entire spine  available in this enhanced version of our technology  which include i stimulated electromyography emg  ii free run emg  iii motor evoked potentials meps  iv somatosensory evoked potentials sseps  and v navigated guidance 
biologics in we expanded our biologics offering by acquiring the osteocel technology  an allograft cellular matrix designed to mimic the biologic profile of autograft that includes endogenous mscs and osteoprogenitors to aid in fusion 
additionally  in early we made an investment in progentix orthobiology  bv  a private company working to develop a novel synthetic bone graft material with a unique nano surface structure that allows for superior protein attachment 
this investment includes options and obligations to buy progentix orthobiology  bv over time as development and commercial milestones are achieved 
our strategy our objective is to become a leading provider of creative medical products that provide comprehensive solutions for the surgical treatment of spine disorders 
we are pursuing the following business strategies in order to achieve this objective establish our mas platform as the standard of care 
we believe our mas platform has the potential to become the standard of care for spine surgery as spine surgeons continue to recognize their benefits and adopt our products 
we also believe that our mas platform has the potential to dramatically improve the clinical results of spine surgery 
we dedicate significant resources to educating spine surgeons and their patients on the clinical benefits of our products  and we intend to capitalize on the demand for minimally disruptive surgical alternatives 
continue to develop and introduce new creative products 
one of our core competencies is our ability to develop and commercialize creative spine surgery products 
in the past several years  we have introduced a continuous flow of new products and product enhancements 
we have several additional products currently under development that should expand our presence in fusion surgery as well as provide an entry into the motion preservation market segment 
we intend to accomplish this with an unwavering commitment to our mas platform and building on our core technology 
we believe that these additional products will allow us to increase our market share while improving patient care 
protecting and defending the intellectual property related to our innovative products is a core component to this strategy 
expand the reach of our exclusive sales force 
we believe that having a sales force dedicated to selling only our spine surgery products is critical to achieving continued growth across product lines  greater market penetration and increased sales 
our global sales force is managed by three executive vice presidents managing the following territories asia pacific  emea europe  middle east and africa and the americas 
in the united states  we have an exclusive sales force that is managed by our executive vice president of the americas who manages five area vice presidents  responsible for a geographic region of the country 
each area vice president manages the directly employed and exclusive independent sales agents engaged in that territory 
outside of the united states  each executive vice president manages directly employed sales agents  independent sales agents and exclusive distributors within their respective territory 
provide tailored solutions in response to surgeon needs 
responding quickly to the needs of spine surgeons  which we refer to as absolute responsiveness  is central to our corporate culture  critical to our success and  we believe  differentiates us from our competition 
we solicit information and feedback from our surgeon customers and clinical advisors regarding the utility of  and potential improvements  to our products 
for example  we have an on site machine shop to allow us to rapidly manufacture product prototypes and two state of the art cadaver operating theatres one on the east coast and one on the west coast to provide clinical training and validate new ideas through prototype testing 
absolute responsiveness goes beyond product development to include active support in clinical research and payer relations 
for 
table of contents example  to ensure that patients have access to optimal spine care  we offer support to spine surgeons in their efforts to educate payers on the proven clinical benefits of surgery for well selected patients 
selectively license or acquire complementary spine products and technologies 
in addition to building our company through internal product development efforts  we intend to selectively license or acquire complementary products and technologies that we believe will keep us on the forefront of innovation 
by acquiring complementary products  we believe we can leverage our expertise at bringing new products to market that are intended to improve patient outcomes  simplify techniques  reduce hospitalization and rehabilitation times and  as a result  reduce costs 
industry background and market the spine is the core of the human skeleton  and provides a crucial balance between structural support and flexibility 
it consists of separate bones called vertebrae that are connected together by connective tissue used herein to define bone  muscle  or ligament to form a column and to permit a normal range of motion 
the spinal cord  the body s central nerve conduit  is enclosed within the spinal column 
vertebrae are paired into what are called motion segments that move by means of three joints two facet joints and one spine disc 
the four major categories of spine disorders are degenerative conditions  deformities  trauma and tumors 
the largest market  and the focus of our business historically  is degenerative conditions of the facet joints and intervertebral disc space 
these conditions can result in instability and pressure on the nerve roots as they exit the spinal column  causing back pain or radiating pain in the arms or legs 
in the united states  over million people suffer from some type of chronic back pain 
the prescribed treatment depends on the severity and duration of the disorder 
initially  physicians will prescribe non operative  conservative procedures including bed rest  medication  lifestyle modification  exercise  physical therapy  chiropractic care and steroid injections 
in most cases  non operative treatment options are effective  however  some patients require spine fusion surgery 
idata research has estimated that over  spine fusion procedures are performed annually in the united states  and the vast majority are done using traditional open surgical techniques from either a front or back approach 
these traditional open surgical approaches require a large incision in the patient s abdomen or back in order to enable the surgeon to access and see the spine and surrounding area 
these open procedures are invasive  lengthy and complex  and typically result in significant blood loss  extensive dissection of tissue and lengthy patient hospitalization and rehabilitation 
back pain is one of the leading causes of healthcare expenditures in the united states  with a direct cost of more than billion annually for diagnosis  treatment and rehabilitation 
the us market for lumbar and cervical spine fusion  the focus of our business  was estimated to be approximately billion in and is estimated to remain at approximately that level in we believe that the implant market for spine surgery procedures will continue to grow over the long term because of the following market dynamics demand for surgical alternatives with less tissue disruption 
as with other surgical markets  we anticipate that the broader acceptance of surgical treatments with less tissue disruption will result in increased demand for these types of surgical procedures 
increasing demand for motion preserving treatments 
motion preserving treatments potentially offer more effective earlier intervention in the degenerative disease process for many patients 
favorable demographics 
the population segment most likely to experience back pain is expected to increase as a result of aging baby boomers  people born between and we believe this population segment will increasingly demand a quicker return to activities of daily living following surgery than prior generations 
increased use of implants 
the use of implants has evolved into the standard of care in spine surgery 
over the past five years  there has been a significant increase in the percentage of spine fusion surgeries using implants and we estimate that over of all spine fusion surgeries now involve implants 

table of contents surgical alternatives with less tissue disruption the benefits of minimally invasive surgery procedures in other areas of orthopedics have significantly contributed to the strong and growing demand for surgical alternatives with less tissue disruption of the spine 
surgeons and hospitals seek spine procedures that result in fewer operative complications and decreased hospitalization 
at the same time  patients seek procedures that cause less trauma  allow for faster recovery times and more positive clinical outcomes 
despite these benefits  the rate of adoption of surgical alternatives with less tissue disruption procedures has been relatively slow with respect to the spine 
we believe the two principal factors contributing to spine surgeons slow adoption of traditional minimally invasive spine alternatives are i the limited or lack of direct access to and visibility of the surgical anatomy  and ii the associated complex instruments that have been required to perform these procedures 
most traditional minimally invasive spine systems do not allow the surgeon to directly view the spine and provide only restrictive visualization through a camera system or endoscope  while also requiring the use of complex surgical techniques 
in addition  most traditional minimally invasive spine systems use complex or highly customized surgical instruments that require special training and the completion of a large number of trial cases before the surgeon becomes proficient using the system 
the nuvasive solution maximum access surgery mas our mas platform allows surgeons to perform a wide range of minimally disruptive procedures  while overcoming the shortcomings of traditional minimally invasive spine surgical techniques 
we believe our products improve clinical results and have both the potential to expand the number of minimally disruptive procedures performed and become the standard of care in spine fusion and non fusion surgery 
our mas platform combines four product categories our nerve monitoring systems  maxcess  biologics and specialized implants 
our nerve monitoring systems enable surgeons to detect and navigate around nerves while maxcess affords direct customized access to the spine for implant delivery 
maxcess also allows surgeons to use well established traditional instruments in a minimally disruptive and less traumatic manner while our biologics offering complements our mas platform by facilitating fusion 
we also offer a variety of specialized implants that enable the maximization of disc height restoration and sufficient structural support while conforming to the anatomical requirements of the patient 
our products facilitate minimally disruptive applications of the following spine surgery procedures  among others lumbar fusion procedures in which the surgeon approaches the spine through the patient s back or abdomen  decompression  which is removal of a portion of bone or disc from over or under the nerve root to relieve pinching of the nerve  and procedures designed to correct and or stabilize the spine while simultaneously maintaining motion 
mas nerve monitoring our nerve monitoring systems utilize electromyography  or emg  proprietary software hunting algorithms and graphical user interfaces to provide surgeons with an enhanced nerve avoidance system 
our systems function by monitoring changes in electrical signals across muscle groups  which allows us to detect underlying changes in nerve activity 
we connect the instruments that surgeons use to a computer system that provides real time  surgeon directed and surgeon controlled feedback during surgery 
our systems analyze and then translate complex neurophysiologic data into simple  useful information to assist the surgeon s clinical decision making process 
for example  during a pedicle screw test  in which the integrity of the bone where the implant is placed is tested  if the insertion of a screw results in a breach of the bone  a red light and corresponding numeric value will result so that the surgeon may reposition the screw to avoid potential nerve impingement or irritation 
if no breach of the bone occurs  a green light and corresponding numeric value will result 
surgeons can dynamically link familiar surgical instruments to our nerve monitoring systems  thus creating an interactive set of instruments that enable the safe navigation through the body s nerve anatomy 
the connection is 
table of contents accomplished using a clip that is attached to the instrument  effectively providing the benefits of our nerve monitoring systems through an instrument already familiar to the surgeon 
the systems proprietary software and easy to use graphical user interface enables the surgeon to make critical decisions in real time resulting in safer and faster procedures with the potential for improved patient outcomes 
with recent additions  the health and integrity of the spinal cord can also be assessed using motor evoked potentials meps and somatosensory evoked potentials sseps 
both methods of intraoperative monitoring involve applying stimulation and recording the response that must travel along the motor or sensory paths of the spinal cord 
the data developed using our nerve monitoring systems can now be sent to health care professionals for additional interpretation of intraoperative information via networking capabilities and software that allows real time assessment from remote locations 
mas maxcess our patented maxcess system consists of instrumentation and specialized implants that provide maximum access to the spine with minimal soft tissue disruption 
maxcess has a split blade design consisting of three blades that can be positioned to build the surgical exposure in the shape and size specific to the surgical requirements rather than the fixed tube design of traditional minimally invasive spine surgical systems 
maxcess split blade design also provides expanded access to the spine  which allows surgeons to perform surgical procedures using instruments that are similar to those used in open procedures but with a significantly smaller incision 
the ability to use familiar instruments reduces the learning curve and facilitates the adoption of our products 
our system s illumination of the operative corridor aids in providing surgeons with better direct visualization of the patient s anatomy  without the need for additional technology or other special equipment 
over the years  several improvements to our maxcess systems have been made  including incorporating nerve avoidance technology and improving the blade systems 
further  our maxcess products are used in the cervical spine for posterior application  the lumbar spine for decompression  transforaminal interbody fusion  or tlif  and have been used in the thoracic region as the lateral approach has broadened from the lumbar to the thoracic region as well as into adult degenerative scoliosis procedures 
mas specialized implants we have a number of implants designed to be used with our mas platform 
these implants are used for interbody disc height restoration for fusion and stabilization of the spine 
our implants are available in a variety of shapes and sizes to accommodate the anatomical requirements of the patient and the particular fusion procedure 
our implants are designed for insertion into the smallest possible space while maximizing surface area contact for fusion 
our fixation systems have been uniquely designed to be delivered through our maxcess system to provide stabilization of the spine 
these systems enable minimally disruptive placement of implants and are intended to reduce patient morbidity  often through a single approach 
we have also made significant progress in the last few years on our research and development initiatives related to motion preservation  including our pcm and mechanical lateral total disc replacement xl tdr products 
the status of our regulatory applications with the fda related to our motion preservation products is discussed below under the heading development projects 
mas biologics as part of our mas offering  we have expanded our product offerings in the last few years to include products in the biologics market 
the global biologics market in spine surgery has grown to approximately billion and consists of autograft autologous human tissue  allograft donated human tissue  a varied offering of synthetic products  stem cell based products  and growth factors 
we made our initial entry into this market in by acquiring rights to formagraft  a collagen based synthetic bone substitute 
we expanded this offering in by acquiring osteocel  an allograft cellular matrix designed to mimic the biologic profile of autograft that includes endogenous mcss and osteoprogenitors to aid in fusion 
additionally  in early  we made an investment in progentix orthobiology  bv  a private company working to develop a novel synthetic bone graft material 
we are currently in the process of seeking regulatory clearance for attrax  a synthetic bone graft material being developed by progentix delivered in putty form 

table of contents development projects we are developing proprietary total disc replacement devices for lateral lumbar spine applications and separately for cervical spine applications 
these devices are intended to allow surgeons to address a patient s pain and dysfunction while maintaining a more physiological range of motion compared with fusion 
commercialization of these devices  including pcm  neodisc  and xl tdr  will require premarket approval rather than k clearance 
in the cervical spine  the pcm investigational device  a total disc replacement device designed to preserve motion  was submitted for fda approval in the first quarter of approval of pcm  if obtained  should further strengthen our cervical product offering and should enable us to continue our trend of increasing our market share 
also in the cervical spine  patient enrollment in the fda approved clinical trial of the neodisc total disc replacement device in the united states is complete 
our lumbar motion preservation development efforts include xl tdr  a mechanical total disc replacement implanted through the xlif approach 
enrollment in a fda approved xl tdr clinical trial in the united states was initiated in and will continue throughout in addition to the motion preservation platforms previously mentioned  we continue development on a wide variety of projects intended to broaden surgical applications such as with tumor  trauma  and deformity  and increase fixation options for greater vertical integration of our mas techniques 
we also continue expanding our cervical product portfolio to provide for a comprehensive cervical offering that will include further segmentation of both the fixation and motion preservation markets 
research and development our research and development efforts are primarily focused on developing further enhancements to our existing products  launching new product categories  as well as developing our total disc replacement products 
as of december   our research and development staff consists of shareowners employees  which includes shareowners in regulatory and quality assurance 
our research and development group has extensive experience in developing products to treat spine pathologies and this group continues to work closely with our clinical advisors and spine surgeon customers to design products that are intended to improve patient outcomes  simplify techniques  reduce hospitalization and rehabilitation times and  as a result  reduce costs 
sales and marketing in the united states  we currently sell our products through a combination of exclusive independent sales agencies and direct sales representatives employed by us 
importantly  both our direct sales representatives as well as our independent sales agencies are exclusive and sell only nuvasive spine surgery products 
each member of our us sales force is responsible for a defined territory  with our independent sales representatives acting as our sole representative in their respective territories 
the determination of whether to engage a directly employed shareowner or exclusive distributor is made on a territory by territory basis  with a focus on the candidate who brings the best skills and experience 
currently  the split between directly employed and independent sales agents in our sales force is roughly equal 
our international sales force is comprised of directly employed exclusive shareowners as well as exclusive distributors and independent sales agents 
there are many reasons that we believe strongly in an exclusive sales force  none more important than having a sales force that is properly educated  trained and incentivized to sell and represent only our portfolio of products 
our global sales force is managed by three executive vice presidents managing the following territories asia pacific  emea europe  middle east and africa and the americas 
in the united states  our executive vice president of the americas manages five area vice presidents 
each area vice president is responsible for a portion of the united states and manages the directly employed and exclusive independent sales agents engaged in that territory 
outside of the united states  each executive vice president manages directly employed sales agents  independent sales agents and exclusive independent distributors in their respective territory 

table of contents surgeon training and education nuvasive devotes significant resources to training and educating surgeons regarding the safety and reproducibility of our surgical techniques and our complimentary instruments and implants 
we maintain state of the art cadaver operating rooms and training facilities at our corporate headquarters and our facility in paramus  new jersey to help promote adoption of our products 
currently  we are training over surgeons annually in the xlif technique and our other mas platform products including our proprietary nerve monitoring systems  maxcess  biologics  and specialized implants 
nuvasive has also helped to establish solas  the society of lateral access surgery  a group of spine surgeons dedicated to the development and expanded application of lateral spine surgery techniques that offer significant patient benefits and improved clinical outcomes through peer to peer communication  clinical education efforts  and ongoing research 
the number of surgeons trained annually includes first time surgeons new to our mas product platform as well as surgeons previously trained on our mas product platform who are attending advanced training programs 
manufacturing and supply we rely on third parties for the manufacture of our products  their components and servicing 
we currently maintain alternative manufacturing sources for some components of our nerve monitoring systems  maxcess  and spherx  as well as some of our other finished goods products 
we have and are in the process of identifying and qualifying additional suppliers  on a per product basis  for our highest volume products to maintain consistent supply to our customers 
our outsourcing strategy is targeted at companies that meet fda  international organization for standardization  or iso  and quality standards supported by internal policies and procedures 
supplier performance is maintained and managed through a supplier qualification and corrective action program intended to ensure that all product requirements are met or exceeded 
we believe these manufacturing relationships minimize our capital investment  help control costs  and allow us to compete with larger volume manufacturers of spine surgery products 
following the receipt of products or product components from our third party manufacturers  we conduct inspection  packaging and labeling  as needed  at either our headquarters facility or our distribution facility 
under our existing contracts  we reserve the exclusive right to inspect and assure conformance of each product and product component to our specifications 
in the future  we may consider manufacturing certain products or product components internally  if and when demand or quality requirements make it economic or appropriate to do so 
we currently rely on tissue banks international  inc  community tissue services and allosource  inc as our only suppliers of allograft tissue implants 
allosource is also our sole supplier of osteocel plus  which is processed from allograft 
like our relationships with our device manufacturing suppliers  we subject our tissue processing suppliers to the same quality criteria in terms of selection  qualification  and verification of processed tissue quality upon receipt of goods  as well as hold them accountable to compliance with fda regulation  state requirements  as well as voluntary industry standards such as the american association of tissue banks  or aatb 
invibio  inc is our exclusive supplier of polyetheretherketone peek  which comprises our peek partial vertebral body product called coroent 
we also have an exclusive supply arrangement with sparton medical corporation sparton pursuant to which sparton is our exclusive supplier of our nv m and nv jjb neuromonitoring systems

our facility and the facilities of our third party manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by regulatory authorities  and may undergo compliance inspections conducted by the fda and corresponding state agencies 

table of contents loaned instrument sets we seek to deliver surgical instrument sets  including our nerve monitoring systems  on a just in time basis to fulfill our customer obligations to meet surgery schedules 
we do not receive separate economic value specific to the loaned instrument sets from the surgeons or hospitals that utilize them 
in most cases  once the surgery is finished  the surgical instrument sets are returned to us and we prepare them for shipment to meet future surgeries 
this strategy is designed to minimize backlogs  increase asset turns and maximize cash flow 
our pool of surgical equipment that we loan to or place with hospitals continues to increase as we expand our distribution channels and increase market penetration of our products 
these loaned surgical instrument sets are important to the growth of our business and we anticipate additional investments in our loaner assets 
intellectual property we rely on a combination of patent  trademark  copyright  trade secret and other intellectual property laws  nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
we believe that in order to have a competitive advantage  we must develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technologies 
we require our shareowners  consultants and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment  consulting or advisory relationships with us

competition we are aware of a number of major medical device companies that have developed or plan to develop products for use in surgical alternatives with less tissue disruption in each of our current and future product categories 
our currently marketed products are  and any future products we commercialize will be  subject to intense competition 
several of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do  and they may succeed in developing products that would render our products obsolete or noncompetitive 
in addition  these competitors may have significantly greater operating history and reputations than we do in their respective fields 
our ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability to develop proprietary products that reach the market in a timely manner  receive adequate reimbursement and are safer  less invasive and less expensive than alternatives available for the same purpose 
because of the size of the potential market  we anticipate that companies will dedicate significant resources to developing competing products 
below are our primary competitors grouped by our product categories 
our nerve monitoring systems compete with the traditional nerve monitoring systems offered by medtronic sofamor danek medtronic  cadwell  and viasys healthcare  a division of carefusion 
we believe our systems compete favorably with these systems on ease of use for the spine surgeon  with the added advantage that our nerve monitoring systems were designed to support surgeon directed  surgeon controlled applications with automated  real time information 
medtronic s nim eclipse neuromonitoring system  acquired from axon  while surgeon directed  requires manual interpretation for neuromonitoring 
several companies offer products that compete with our maxcess system  spherx pedicle screw system and implants  including competitive offerings by depuy spine  inc depuy  a johnson johnson company  medtronic and stryker spine 
competition is intense in the fusion product market 
we believe that our most significant competitors are medtronic  depuy  stryker spine and synthes  inc  each of which has substantially greater sales and financial resources than we do 
medtronic  in particular  has a broad classic fusion product line 
we believe our differentiation in the market is an innovative portfolio of products elegantly delivered through our maxcess system  as well as through our xlif approach  complemented by additional innovative and pull though products along the entirety of 
table of contents the spine 
however  with the introduction of competing lateral techniques  such as medtronic s dlif  we face more competition in the market 
competition in the motion preservation segment is increasing  with medtronic  depuy  stryker spine and synthes  inc all investing in this rapidly growing market 
in the cervical total disc replacement tdr segment  our pcm  which was submitted for fda approval in the first quarter of  if approved  will face competition from several products that received fda approval in including medtronic s prestige and bryan tdrs as well as synthes  inc s prodisc c tdr 
while our acquisition of osteocel and our investment in progentix orthobiology  bv provide us with additional products to compete in the biologics market  competition is increasing 
in addition to our larger competitors  which are investing in their biologics platforms  we face competition from smaller orthobiologics companies such as orthovita  inc  orthofix international nv blackstone medical  inc 
orthofix  alphatec spine  inc alphatec  nutech medical  inc  the musculoskelatal transplant foundation mtf and osteotech  inc we also face competition from a significant number of smaller companies with more limited product offerings and geographic reach than our larger competitors 
these companies  who represent intense competition in specified markets  include globus medical  inc  zimmer spine  orthofix  biomet ebi spine  alphatec  and others 
government regulation our products are medical devices and tissues subject to extensive regulation by the fda and other regulatory bodies 
fda regulations govern  among other things  the following activities that we or our partners perform and will continue to perform product design and development  product testing  product manufacturing  product labeling  product storage  premarket clearance or approval  advertising and promotion  and product sales and distribution 
fda s premarket clearance and approval requirements unless an exemption applies  each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the united states will require either prior k clearance or prior premarket approval from the fda 
the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes 
devices deemed to pose lower risk are placed in either class i or ii  which requires the manufacturer to submit to the fda a premarket notification requesting permission for commercial distribution 
this process is known as k clearance 
some low risk devices are exempt from this requirement 
devices deemed by the fda to pose the greatest risk  such as life sustaining  life supporting or implantable devices  or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared k device are placed in class iii  requiring premarket approval 
k clearance pathway to obtain k clearance  a premarket notification must be submitted demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared k device or a device that was in commercial distribution before may  for which the fda has not yet called for the submission of premarket approval applications 
the fda s k clearance pathway usually takes from three to twelve months from the date the application is completed  but it can take significantly longer 

table of contents after a device receives k clearance  any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness  or that would constitute a major change in its intended use  will require a new k clearance or could require premarket approval 
the fda requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially  but the fda can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer s determination 
if the fda disagrees with a manufacturer s determination  the fda can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and or recall the modified device until k clearance or premarket approval is obtained 
if the fda requires us to seek k clearance or premarket approval for any modifications to a previously cleared product  we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval 
also  in these circumstances  we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties 
we have made and plan to continue to make additional product enhancements that we believe do not require new k clearances 
premarket approval pma pathway a pma application must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared through the k process 
a pma application must be supported by extensive data including  but not limited to  technical information  preclinical data  clinical trial data  manufacturing data and labeling to demonstrate  to the fda s satisfaction  the safety and efficacy of the device for its intended use 
once a complete pma application is submitted  the fda begins an in depth review which generally takes between one and three years  but may take significantly longer 
during this review period  the fda may request additional information or clarification of information already provided 
also  during the review period  an advisory panel of experts from outside the fda may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda as to the approvability of the device 
in addition  the fda will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with quality system regulations 
new pmas or pma supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process  labeling or design of a device that is approved through the pma process 
a pma supplement often requires submission of the same type of information as an original pma application  except that a supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original pma application  and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel 
human cell  tissue  and cellular and tissue based products our allograft implant products and our osteocel plus products are regulated by the fda as human cell  tissue  and cellular and tissue based products 
fda regulations do not currently require products regulated as minimally manipulated human tissue based products to be k cleared or pma approved before they are marketed 
we are  however  required to register our establishment  list these products with the fda and comply with current good tissue practices for human cell  tissue  and cellular and tissue based product establishments 
the fda periodically inspects tissue processors to determine compliance with these requirements 
violations of applicable regulations noted by the fda during facility inspections could adversely affect the continued marketing of our products 
we believe we comply with all aspects of the current good tissue practices  although there can be no assurance that we will comply  or will comply on a timely basis  in the future 
entities that provide us with allograft bone tissue are responsible for performing donor recovery  donor screening and donor testing and our compliance with those aspects of the current good tissue practices regulations that regulate those functions are dependent upon the actions of these independent entities 
the procurement and transplantation of allograft bone tissue is subject to us federal law pursuant to the national organ transplant act  or nota  a criminal statute which prohibits the purchase and sale of human organs used in human transplantation  including bone and related tissue  for valuable consideration 
nota permits reasonable payments associated with the removal  transportation  processing  preservation  quality control  implantation and storage of human bone tissue 
with the exception of removal and implantation  we provide services in all of these areas 
we make payments to vendors in consideration for the services they provide in connection with the recovery and screening of donors 
failure to comply with the requirements of nota could result in enforcement action against us 
the procurement of human tissue is also subject to state anatomical gift acts and some states have statutes similar to nota 
in addition  some states require that tissue processors be licensed by that state 
failure to comply with state laws could also result in enforcement action against us 

table of contents clinical trials a clinical trial is almost always required to support a pma application and is sometimes required for a k premarket notification 
these trials generally require approval of a submitted application for an investigational device exemption ide to the fda 
the ide application must be supported by appropriate data  such as animal and laboratory testing results  showing that it is safe to evaluate the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound 
the ide application must be approved in advance by the fda for a specified number of subjects  unless the product is deemed a non significant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated ide requirements 
clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the ide application is approved by the fda and the responsible institutional review boards 
future clinical trials of our motion preservation designs will likely require that we obtain ides from the fda prior to commencing clinical trials 
we have gained ide approval from the fda to begin a clinical trial relating to neodisc  our embroidery cervical disc replacement device  and have completed patient enrollment for this trial 
we filed with the fda for ides on the mechanical lateral tdr xl tdr  and were granted an ide in our clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with fda regulations and other federal regulations concerning human subject protection and privacy and must be publicly registered 
the results of our clinical trials may not be sufficient to obtain approval of our product 
there are numerous risks associated with conducting such a clinical trial  including the high costs and uncertain outcomes 
for a complete discussion of these risks  please see the risk factors section of this annual report 
pervasive and continuing fda regulation after a device is placed on the market  numerous regulatory requirements apply 
these include  but are not limited to quality system regulation  which requires manufacturers to follow design  testing  process control  and other quality assurance procedures  labeling regulations  which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or off label uses and impose other restrictions on labeling  and medical device reporting regulations  which require that manufacturers report to the fda if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the fda  which may include any of the following sanctions fines  injunctions  and civil penalties  recall or seizure of our products  operating restrictions  partial suspension or total shutdown of production  refusing our request for k clearance or premarket approval of new products  withdrawing k clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted  and criminal prosecution 
we are subject to unannounced device inspections by the fda and the california food and drug branch  as well as other regulatory agencies overseeing the implementation and adherence of applicable state and federal tissue licensing regulations 
these inspections may include our subcontractors facilities 
pursuant to fda regulations  we can only market our products for cleared or approved uses 
although surgeons are permitted to use medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the fda based on their medical judgment  we are prohibited from promoting products for such off label uses 

table of contents healthcare regulation and commercial compliance the healthcare industry is highly regulated and changes in laws and regulations can be significant 
changes in the law or new interpretation of existing laws can have a material effect on our permissible activities  the relative costs associated with doing business and the amount of reimbursement by government and other third party payers 
the federal government and all states in which we currently operate regulate various aspects of our business 
failure to comply with these laws could adversely affect our ability to receive reimbursement for our services and subject us and our officers and agents to civil and criminal penalties 
anti kickback statute we are subject to the federal anti kickback statute which  among other things  prohibits the knowing and willful solicitation  offer  payment or receipt of any remuneration  direct or indirect  in cash or in kind  in return for or to induce the referral of patients for items or services covered by medicare  medicaid and certain other governmental health programs 
under patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of  or ppaca  knowledge of the anti kickback statute or the specific intent to violate the law is not required 
violation of the anti kickback statute may result in civil or criminal penalties and exclusion from the medicare  medicaid and other federal healthcare programs  and according to ppaca  now provides a basis for liability under the false claims act 
many states have enacted similar statutes  which are not limited to items and services paid for under medicare or a federally funded healthcare program 
we believe that our operations materially comply with the anti kickback statutes  however  because these provisions are interpreted broadly by regulatory authorities  we cannot be assured that law enforcement officials or others will not challenge our operations under these statutes 
federal false claims act the federal false claims act and  in particular  the false claims act s qui tam or whistleblower provisions allow a private individual to bring actions in the name of the government alleging that a defendant has made false claims for payment from federal funds 
in addition  various states are considering or have enacted laws modeled after the federal false claims act  penalizing false claims against state funds 
if an action is brought against us  even if it is dismissed with no judgment or settlement  we may incur substantial legal fees and other costs relating to an investigation 
actions brought under the false claims act may result in significant fines and legal fees and distract our management s attention  which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we strive to ensure that we meet applicable requirements of the false claims act 
however  the costs of defending claims under the false claims act  as well as sanctions imposed under the act  could significantly affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
health insurance portability and accountability act under the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  as was amended in and in  a covered entity is required to adhere to certain requirements regarding the use  disclosure and security of protected health information  or phi 
in the past  hipaa has generally affected us indirectly  as nuvasive is generally not a covered entity  except to the extent we provide neuromonitoring services  and is not a business associate to covered entities 
in those cases  where patient data is received  nuvasive is committed to maintaining the security and privacy of phi 
the potential for enforcement action against us is now greater  as the us department of health and human services hhs can take action directly against business associates 
thus  while we believe we are and will be in compliance with all hipaa standards  there is no guarantee that the government will not disagree 
enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt regular operations of our business 
nonetheless  these new requirements affect only a small portion of our business 
we believe the ongoing costs and impacts of assuring compliance with the hipaa privacy and security rules are not material to our business 
foreign corrupt practices act the united states and foreign government regulators have increased regulation  enforcement  inspections and governmental investigations of the medical device industry  including increased united states government oversight and enforcement of the foreign corrupt practices act 
whenever the united states or another foreign governmental authority concludes that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations  such governmental authority can impose fines  delay or suspend regulatory clearances  institute proceedings to detain or seize our products  issue a recall  impose operating restrictions  enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees  and can recommend criminal prosecution to the department of justice 
moreover  governmental authorities can ban or request the recall  repair  replacement or refund of the cost of any device or product we manufacture or distribute 
any of the foregoing actions could result in 
table of contents decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims  and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
physician payments sunshine act of  or sunshine act the sunshine act was enacted into law in and requires public disclosure to the federal government of payments to physicians  including in kind transfers of value such as free gifts or meals 
these requirements all provide for penalties for non compliance 
this new law  along with individual state reporting requirements  such as in massachusetts and vermont  increases the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements 
compliance program the federal government has recommended  in the federal sentencing guidelines  that health care companies develop and maintain an effective compliance program to reduce the likelihood of non compliance by the company  its employees  agents and contractors 
a compliance program is a set of internal controls established by a company to prevent and or detect any non compliant activities and to address properly those issues that may be discovered 
in addition  some states  such as massachusetts and california now require certain health care companies to have a formal compliance program in place in order to do business within the state 
for years  nuvasive has maintained a compliance program structured to meet the requirements of the federal sentencing guidelines for an effective compliance program and the model compliance programs promulgated by hhs over the years and includes  but is not limited to  a code of ethical business conduct  designation of a compliance officer  a confidential disclosure method a hotline  and conducting periodic audits to ensure compliance 
foreign government regulation sales of medical devices outside the united states are subject to foreign government regulations  which vary substantially from country to country 
the time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval  and the requirements may differ 
the european union  which consists of countries in europe  has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design  manufacture  clinical trials  labeling  and adverse event reporting for medical devices 
other countries  such as switzerland  have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the european union with respect to medical devices 
devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear ce conformity marking and  accordingly  can be commercially distributed throughout europe 
the method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product  but normally involves a combination of self assessment by the manufacturer and a third party assessment by a notified body 
this third party assessment consists of an audit of the manufacturer s quality system and technical review of the manufacturer s product 
we have now successfully passed several notified body audits since our original certification in  granting us iso registration and allowing the ce conformity marking to be applied to certain of our devices under the european union medical device directive 
the japanese government in recent years made revisions to the pharmaceutical affairs law pal that made significant changes to the preapproval regulatory systems 
these changes have in part  stipulated that in addition to obtaining a manufacturing or import approval from the ministry of health  labor and welfare mhlw certain low risk medical devices can now be evaluated by third party organizations 
based on the risk based classification  manufacturers are provided three procedures for satisfying the pal requirements prior to placing products on the market  pre market submission todokede  pre market certification ninsho and pre market approval shonin 
nuvasive intends to market devices in japan that will be assessed by both government entities and third party organizations using all three procedures in place for manufacturers 
the level of review and time line for medical device approval will depend on the risk based classification and subsequent regulatory procedure that the medical device is aligned based on assessment against the pharmaceutical affairs law 
manufacturers must also obtain a manufacturing or import license from the prefectural government prior to importing medical devices 
we will also be pursuing authorizations required by the prefectural government 
third party reimbursement we expect that sales volumes and prices of our products will continue to be largely dependent on the availability of reimbursement from third party payers  such as governmental programs  for example  medicare and 
table of contents medicaid  private insurance plans and managed care programs 
reimbursement is contingent on established coding for a given procedure  coverage of the codes by the third party payers  and adequate payment for the resources used 
physician coding for procedures is established by the american medical association  or ama 
for coding related to spine surgery  the north american spine society  or nass  is the primary liaison to ama 
in july of nass established the proper physician coding for the xlif procedure by declaring it to be encompassed in existing codes that describe an anterolateral approach to the spine 
this position was confirmed in a formal statement by nass in january hospital coding is established by the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms 
xlif is included in the nomenclature for hospital codes as an additional descriptor under existing codes 
all physician and hospital coding is subject to change which could impact reimbursement and physician practice behavior 
independent of the coding status  third party payers may deny coverage based on their own criteria  such as if they feel that a device or procedure is not well established clinically  is not the most cost effective treatment available  or is used for an unapproved indication 
at various times over the past two years  certain insurance providers have adopted policies of not providing reimbursement for the xlif procedure 
we have worked with our surgeon customers and nass who  in turn  have worked with these insurance providers to supply the information  explanation and clinical data they require to categorize the xlif procedure as a procedure entitled to reimbursement under their policies 
at present  all major insurance companies provide reimbursement for xlif procedures  including aetna  cigna  humana  health care service corporation  and united healthcare  each of whom has reversed their prior policy of non coverage 
certain smaller regional carriers  however  have policies against coverage of xlif 
we will continue to provide the appropriate resources to patients  surgeons  hospitals  and insurers in order to ensure optimum patient care and clarity regarding xlif reimbursement and work to remove any and all non coverage policies 
national and regional coverage policy decisions are subject to unforeseeable change and have the potential to impact physician behavior 
for a complete discussion of these risks  please see the risk factors section of this annual report 
payment amounts are established by government and private payer programs and are subject to fluctuations which could impact physician practice behavior 
third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for a wide range of medical products and services  including those in spine where we participate 
in international markets  reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific product lines 
there can be no assurance that our products will be accepted by third party payers  that reimbursement will be available or  if available  that the third party payers reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably 
particularly in the united states  third party payers carefully review  and increasingly challenge  the prices charged for procedures and medical products as well as any technology that they  in their own judgment  consider experimental or investigational 
in addition  an increasing percentage of insured individuals are receiving their medical care through managed care programs  which monitor and often require pre approval of the services that a member will receive 
many managed care programs are paying their providers on a capitated basis  which puts the providers at financial risk for the services provided to their patients by paying them a predetermined payment per member per month 
the percentage of individuals covered by managed care programs is expected to grow in the united states over the next decade 
we believe that the overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to  and will continue to lead to  increased pressures on the healthcare industry to reduce the costs of products and services 
there can be no assurance that third party reimbursement and coverage will be available or adequate  or that future legislation  regulation  or reimbursement policies of third party payers will not adversely affect the demand for our products or our ability to sell these products on a profitable basis 
the unavailability or inadequacy of third party payer coverage or reimbursement could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
for a complete discussion of these risks  please see the risk factors section of this annual report 

table of contents shareowners our employees we refer to our employees as shareowners 
as of december   we had shareowners  of which were employed in research and development  in regulatory and quality assurance  in general and administrative and operations and in sales and marketing including international shareowners 
in addition to our shareowners  we partner with exclusive independent sales agencies and independent distributors who sell our products in the united states and internationally 
in addition  there are approximately individuals that are a part of the sales  marketing and administrative staffs associated with the exclusive independent sales agencies and independent distributors with whom we partner 
none of our shareowners are represented by a labor union and we believe our shareowner relations are good

item a 
risk factors risk factors which could cause actual results to differ from our expectations and which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations are discussed below and elsewhere in this report 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition  results of operations and our future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected 
under these circumstances  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
further  additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business  operations  liquidity and stock price materially and adversely 
risks related to our business and industry changes to third party reimbursement policies and practices can negatively impact our ability to sell our products at prices necessary to expand our operations and increase profitability 
we believe that future reimbursement may be subject to changes in policies and practices  such as more restrictive criteria to qualify for surgery or reduction in payment amount to hospitals and surgeons for approved surgery  both in the united states and in international markets 
future legislation  regulation or reimbursement policies of third party payers may adversely affect the demand for our existing products or our products currently under development and limit our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis 

table of contents to the extent we sell our products internationally  market acceptance may depend  in part  upon the availability of reimbursement within prevailing healthcare payment systems 
in international markets  reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific product lines 
there can be no assurance that third party payers reimbursement policies and practices will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably 
non coverage decisions concerning our technologies by third party payers may negatively impact our ability to sell our complete product portfolio  expand our operations and increase profitability 
sales of our products will depend on the availability of adequate reimbursement from third party payers 
healthcare providers  such as hospitals that purchase medical devices for treatment of their patients  generally rely on third party payers to reimburse all or part of the costs and fees associated with the procedures performed with these devices 
likewise  spine surgeons rely primarily on third party reimbursement for the surgical fees they earn 
spine surgeons are unlikely to use our products if they do not receive reimbursement adequate to cover the cost of their involvement in the surgical procedures 
certain third party payers have stated non coverage decisions concerning our technologies and implementation of such policies could significantly alter our ability to sell our products 
for example  several smaller regional third party payers  such as blue cross blue shield of florida and medica of minnesota  continue to have reimbursement policies that label xlif surgeries as experimental 
additional payers may also state that our technologies are not covered 
the inability to successfully market our technologies due to lack of reimbursement coverage may adversely impact our ability to acquire new physician clients  increase market penetration with existing clients  or retain existing clients across nuvasive product lines and  therefore  may adversely impact our ability to sell our complete product portfolio  expand our operations and increase profitability 
pricing pressure from our competitors may impact our ability to sell our products at prices necessary to expand our operations  invest in innovative technologies and increase profitability 
the market for spine surgery products is large and growing at a significant rate 
this has attracted numerous new companies and technologies  and encouraged more established companies to intensify competitive pressure 
new entrants to our markets include numerous niche companies with singular product focus  as well as companies owned partially by spine surgeons  who have significant market knowledge and access to the surgeons who use our products 
as a result of this increased competition  we believe there will be continued pricing pressure 
if competitive forces drive down the price we are able to charge for some of our products  and we are not able to counter that pressure as we have historically with the rapid introduction of new offerings  our profit margins will shrink  which will hamper our ability to generate profits and cash flow  and  as a result  to invest in and grow our business  including the investment into new and innovative technologies 
we are in a highly competitive market segment and face competition from large  well established medical device manufacturers as well as new market entrants 
the market for spine surgery products and procedures is intensely competitive  subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
with respect to our nerve monitoring systems  we compete with medtronic sofamor danek  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of medtronic  inc  and viasys healthcare  a division of carefusion  both of which have significantly greater resources than we do  as well as numerous regional nerve monitoring companies 
with respect to maxcess  our minimally disruptive surgical system  our largest competitors are medtronic sofamor danek  inc  depuy spine  inc  a johnson johnson company  and synthes  inc we compete with many of the same companies with respect to our other products 
we also compete with numerous smaller companies with respect to our implant products  many of whom have a significant regional market presence 
at any time  these companies may develop alternative treatments  products or procedures for the treatment of spine disorders that compete directly or indirectly with our products 

table of contents many of our larger competitors are either publicly traded or divisions or subsidiaries of publicly traded companies  and enjoy several competitive advantages over us  including significantly greater name recognition  established relations with a greater number of spine surgeons  hospitals  other healthcare providers and third party payers  larger and more well established distribution networks with significant international presence  products supported by long term clinical data  greater experience in obtaining and maintaining us food and drug administration  or fda  and other regulatory approvals or clearances for products and product enhancements  more expansive portfolios of intellectual property rights  and greater financial and other resources for product research and development  sales and marketing and litigation 
in addition  the spine industry is becoming increasingly crowded with new market entrants  including companies owned at least partially by spine surgeons 
many of these new competitors focus on a specific product or market segment  making it more difficult for us to expand our overall market position 
if these companies become successful  we expect that competition will become even more intense  leading to greater pricing pressure and making it more difficult for us to expand 
our future success depends on our strategy of obsoleting our own products and our ability to timely acquire  develop and introduce new products or product enhancements that will be accepted by the market 
we have the objective of staying ahead of the spine market by obsoleting our own products with new products and enhancements 
it is important to our business that we continue to build upon our product offering to surgeons and hospitals  and enhance the products we currently offer 
as such  our success will depend in part on our ability to acquire  develop and introduce new products and enhancements to our existing products to keep pace with the rapidly changing spine market 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully acquire  develop  obtain regulatory approval for or market new products or that any of our future products or enhancements will be accepted by the surgeons who use our products or the payers who financially support many of the procedures performed with our products 
additionally  in our quest to obsolete our products  we must effectively manage our inventory  the demand for new and current product and the regulatory process for new products in order to avoid unintended financial and accounting consequences 
if we do not effectively manage our strategy of obsoleting our products by acquiring or developing new products or product enhancements that we can introduce in time to meet market demand or if there is insufficient demand for these products or enhancements  or if we do not manage the product transitions well which would result in margin reducing writeoffs for obsolete inventory  our results of operations may suffer 
if clinical trials of our current or future product candidates do not produce results necessary to support regulatory approval in the united states  we will be unable to commercialize these products 
several investigational devices in our development pipeline  including our neodisc cervical disc replacement device  pcm and lateral tdr xl tdr  will require a pma from the fda 
a pma application must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared through the less rigorous k process 
a pma application must be supported by extensive data including  but not limited to  technical  preclinical  clinical trials  manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the fda s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use 
as a result  to receive regulatory approval for neodisc  pcm  xl tdr or other devices requiring pma approval  we must conduct  at our own expense  adequate and well controlled clinical trials to demonstrate efficacy and safety in humans 
clinical testing is expensive  takes many years and has an uncertain outcome 
clinical failure can occur at any stage of the testing 
our clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results  and we may 
table of contents decide  or regulators may require us  to conduct additional clinical and or non clinical testing 
our failure to adequately demonstrate the efficacy and safety of any of our devices would prevent receipt of regulatory approval and  ultimately  the commercialization of that device 
our neodisc  pcm  and xl tdr devices are currently the subject of an investigational device exemption clinical study 
there is no assurance that these devices will be approved for sale in the united states by the fda 
the clinical study may prove that the device does not provide the intended benefit or that there are unintended negative side effects of the device that make it unsafe or not effective 
in addition  the neodisc device includes embroidery technology  which has not been thoroughly studied for use as permanent implants in the spine 
any failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval for these devices will hamper our ability to commercialize the device in the united states 
if our acquisitions are unsuccessful  our business may be harmed 
as part of our business strategy  we have acquired companies  technologies and product lines to maintain our objectives of developing or acquiring innovative technologies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the following the possibility that we will pay more than the value we derive from the acquisition  which could result in future non cash impairment charges and or a dilution of future earnings per share  difficulties in integration of the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired companies  which may require significant attention of our management that otherwise would be available for the ongoing development of our business  the assumption of certain known and unknown liabilities of the acquired companies  and difficulties in retaining key relationships with shareowners employees  customers  partners and suppliers of the acquired company 
any of these factors could have a negative impact on our business  results of operations or financing position 
our investment in progentix orthobiology bv  a private company working to develop a synthetic bone graft material  includes options and obligations to buy progentix orthobiology bv over time as development milestones are achieved 
if the progentix products are not commercially successful or unable to meet expected commercial success  but certain development milestones are achieved  we may be obligated to purchase progentix orthobiology bv at a price greater than the economic value we can derive from the acquisition of that company 
further  past and potential acquisitions entail risks  uncertainties and potential disruptions to our business  especially where we have little experience as a company developing or marketing a particular product or technology as is the case with the progentix products 
for example  we may not be able to successfully integrate an acquired company s operations  business processes  technologies  products and services  information systems and personnel into our business 
acquisitions may also further strain our existing financial and managerial controls  and divert management s attention away from our other business concerns 
our reliance on single source suppliers could limit our ability to meet demand for our products in a timely manner or within our budget 
we rely on third party suppliers and manufacturers to supply and manufacture our products 
to be successful  our contract manufacturers must be able to provide us with products and components in substantial quantities  in compliance with regulatory requirements  in accordance with agreed upon specifications  at acceptable cost and on a timely basis 
our anticipated growth could strain the ability of suppliers to deliver an increasingly large supply of products  materials and components 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of high quality components to meet customer demand on a timely basis  we could lose customers  our reputation may be harmed and our business could suffer 
we currently use one or two manufacturers for each of our devices or components 
our dependence on one or two manufacturers involves several risks  including limited control over pricing  availability  quality and delivery schedules 
if any one or more of our manufacturers cease to provide us with sufficient quantities of our components 
table of contents in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us  or cease to manufacture components of acceptable quality  we would have to seek alternative sources of manufacturing 
we could incur delays while we locate and engage alternative qualified suppliers and we might be unable to engage alternative suppliers on favorable terms 
any such disruption or increased expenses could harm our commercialization efforts and adversely affect our ability to generate revenue 
invibio  inc invibio is our exclusive supplier of polyetheretherketone peek  which comprises our peek partial vertebral body product called coroent 
we have a supply agreement with invibio  pursuant to which we have agreed to purchase our entire supply of polyetheretherketone for our current product lines from invibio 
we also have an exclusive supply arrangement with sparton medical corporation sparton pursuant to which sparton is our exclusive supplier of our proprietary neuromonitoring systems 
in the event we experience delays  shortages  or stoppages of supply with either supplier  we would be forced to locate a suitable alternative supplier which could take significant time and result in significant expense 
any inability to meet our customers demands for these products could lead to decreased sales and harm our reputation and result in the loss of customers to our competitors  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
maxigen biotech  inc  or mbi  is our sole supplier of our formagraft product 
we may require that mbi significantly expand its manufacturing capacity to meet our potential forecasted needs  and no assurance can be given that mbi will be able to meet our requirements 
if we experience difficulties in dealing with mbi  we may not be able to secure an adequate source of supply of formagraft  which could adversely affect our operational results 
we acquired pcm  a motion preserving total disc replacement device  through our acquisition of cervitech  inc cervitech 
our supply of the product comes from two sources waldemar link gmbh co 
kg  a company that was affiliated with cervitech prior to the acquisition  and sandvik medical solutions limited 
upon approval of the pcm product by the fda  we plan on using sandvik medical solutions limited as our sole supplier of pcm 
at such time  we will determine whether to establish alternate suppliers and there is no assurance that we will be able to establish a new supplier which could adversely affect our operational results 
further  tissue banks international  inc  allosource  inc 
and community tissue services collectively supply us with all of our allograft implants 
the processing of human tissue into allograft implants is very labor intensive and it is therefore difficult to maintain a steady supply stream 
allosource is also our exclusive supplier of osteocel plus  which is processed from allograft 
allograft  which is donated human tissue  is a supply constrained material and there is ongoing risk that there will be insufficient supply to produce the necessary quantity of osteocel plus and our other allograft products 
in addition  due to seasonal changes in mortality rates  some scarce tissues used for our allograft products are at times in particularly short supply 
allograft also carries with it the possibility of disease transmission  which could result in negative patient outcomes and negative publicity for us 
we cannot be certain that our supply of allograft from tissue banks international  inc and allosource  inc will be available at current levels or will be sufficient to meet our needs 
if we are no longer able to obtain allograft from these sources in amounts sufficient to meet our needs  we may not be able to locate and engage replacement sources of allograft on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
any interruption of our business caused by the need to locate additional sources of allograft could reduce our revenues 
we are dependent on the services of alexis v 
lukianov and keith c 
valentine  and the loss of either of them could harm our business 
our continued success depends in part upon the continued service of alexis v 
lukianov  our chairman and chief executive officer  and keith c 
valentine  our president and chief operating officer  who are critical to the overall management of nuvasive as well as to the development of our technology  our culture and our strategic direction 
we have entered into employment arrangements with messrs 
lukianov and valentine  but neither of these agreements guarantees the service of the individual for a specified period of time 
the loss of either messr 
lukianov or valentine could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have not obtained and do not expect to obtain any key person life insurance policies 

table of contents if we fail to properly manage our anticipated international growth  our business could suffer 
we have invested  and expect to increase our investment for the foreseeable future  in our expansion into international markets 
to execute our anticipated growth in international markets we must manage the complexities associated with a larger  faster growing and more geographically diverse organization  expand our clinical development resources to manage and execute increasingly global  larger and more complex clinical trials  expand our sales and marketing resources for international expansion and to launch products targeted for international markets  and upgrade our internal business processes and capabilities eg  information technology platform and systems  product distribution and tracking to create the scalability and properly handle the transaction volumes that our growing geographically diverse organization demands 
we currently expect that our operating expenses will continue to increase as we continue to expand into international markets 
we have only limited experience in expanding into international markets as well as marketing and operating our products and services in such markets 
certain international markets  such as japan  take a lot of time and resources to receive product approvals and clearances to sell and promote products 
after we receive the appropriate approvals and clearances  international markets may be slower than domestic markets in adopting our products and are expected to yield lower profit margins when compared to our domestic operations 
additionally  our international endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties  including distraction of management from domestic operations  insufficient revenue to offset expenses associated with our international strategy  and unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence 
because expansion into international markets is inherently risky  no assurance can be given that such strategies and initiatives will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
even if our international expansion is successful  our expenses may increase at a greater pace than our revenues and our operating results could be harmed 
further  our anticipated growth internationally will place additional strain on our suppliers and manufacturers  resulting in increased need for us to carefully monitor quality assurance 
any failure by us to manage our growth effectively could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals 
if we fail to obtain  or experience significant delays in obtaining  fda clearances or approvals for our future products or product enhancements  our ability to commercially distribute and market our products could suffer 
our medical devices are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal  state and foreign governmental authorities 
the process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device  particularly from the fda  can be costly and time consuming  and there can be no assurance that such clearances or approvals will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
in particular  the fda permits commercial distribution of a new medical device only after the device has received clearance under section k of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  or is the subject of an approved pma 
the fda will clear marketing of a medical device through the k process if it is demonstrated that the new product is substantially equivalent to other k cleared products 
we are currently in the process of seeking regulatory clearance for attrax  a synthetic bone graft material being developed by progentix delivered in putty form  through the k process 
the pma process is more costly  lengthy and uncertain than the k clearance process 
additionally  any modification to a k cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or efficacy  or that would constitute a major change in its intended use  requires a new k clearance or  possibly  premarket approval 
the fda may not agree with any of our decisions regarding whether new clearances or approvals are necessary 

table of contents our failure to comply with such regulations could lead to the imposition of injunctions  suspensions or loss of regulatory approvals  product recalls  termination of distribution  or product seizures 
in the most egregious cases  criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facilities are possible 
pursuant to fda regulations  we can only market our products for cleared or approved uses 
if the fda determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an unapproved use  it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions  including the issuance of a warning letter  injunction  seizure  civil fine and criminal penalties 
it is also possible that other federal  state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use  which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities 
additionally  surgeons use several of our products for unapproved uses 
while surgeons are permitted by the fda to use our products for unapproved uses  there is a heightened risk of an enforcement action by a governmental enforcement authority when surgeons engage in that practice 
foreign governmental authorities that regulate the manufacture and sale of medical devices have become increasingly stringent and  to the extent we market and sell our products in foreign countries  we may be subject to rigorous regulation in the future 
in such circumstances  we would rely significantly on our foreign independent sales agencies to comply with the varying regulations  and any failures on their part could result in restrictions on the sale of our products in foreign countries 
the safety of our products is not yet supported by long term clinical data and our products may therefore prove to be less safe and effective than initially thought 
we obtained clearance to offer almost all of our products that require fda clearance or approval through the fda s k clearance process 
the fda s k clearance process is less rigorous than the pma process and requires less supporting clinical data 
as a result  we currently lack the breadth of published long term clinical data supporting the safety of our products and the benefits they offer that might have been generated in connection with the pma process 
for these reasons  spine surgeons may be slow to adopt our products  we may not have comparative data that our competitors have or are generating and we may be subject to greater regulatory and product liability risks 
further  future patient studies or clinical experience may indicate that treatment with our products does not improve patient outcomes 
such results would reduce demand for our products  affect our ability to have sustainable reimbursement for our products from third party payers  significantly reduce our ability to achieve expected revenues and could prevent us from sustaining or increasing profitability 
moreover  if future results and experience indicate that our products cause unexpected or serious complications or other unforeseen negative effects  we could be subject to significant legal liability and harm to our business reputation 
the spine medical device market has been particularly prone to costly product liability litigation 
if we or our suppliers fail to comply with the fda s quality system regulations  the manufacture of our products could be delayed and we may be subject to an enforcement action by the fda 
we and our suppliers are required to comply with the fda s quality system regulations  which cover the methods and documentation of the design  testing  production  control  quality assurance  labeling  packaging  storage and shipping of our products 
the fda enforces the quality system regulation through inspections 
if we or one of our suppliers fail a quality system regulations inspection or if any corrective action plan is not sufficient  the manufacture of our products could be delayed 
we underwent fda inspections regarding our allograft implant business and fda inspections regarding our medical device activities 
in connection with these inspections as well as prior inspections  the fda requested minor corrective actions  which we have implemented 
there can be no assurance the fda will not subject us to further enforcement action and the fda may impose additional inspections at any time 
additionally  we are the legal manufacturer of record for the products that are distributed and labeled by nuvasive  regardless of whether the products are manufactured by us or our suppliers 
thus  a failure by us or our 
table of contents suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the fda  which may include any of the following sanctions fines  injunctions  and civil penalties  recall or seizure of our products  operating restrictions  partial suspension or total shutdown of production  refusing our request for k clearance or premarket approval of new products  withdrawing k clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted  and criminal prosecution 
risks related to our financial results and need for financing we may be unable to grow our revenue or earnings as anticipated  which may have a material adverse effect on our future operating results 
we have experienced rapid growth since our inception  and have increased our revenues from million in  the year of our initial public offering  to million in we anticipate continued growth and have provided guidance related to such growth for our ability to achieve the anticipated growth will depend upon  among other things  the success of our growth strategies  which we cannot assure you will be successful 
in addition  we may have more difficulty maintaining our prior rate of growth of revenues or recent earnings 
our future success will depend upon various factors  including the strength of our brand image  the market success of our current and future products  competitive conditions and our ability to manage increased revenues  if any  or implement our growth strategy 
in addition  we anticipate significantly expanding our infrastructure and adding personnel in connection with our anticipated growth  which we expect will cause our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars and which may cause our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue 
because these expenses are generally fixed  particularly in the short to medium term  operating results may be adversely impacted if we do not achieve our anticipated growth 
the financial crisis and general slowdown of the economy may adversely affect our liquidity and the liquidity of our customers 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in investments in marketable securities 
we have historically invested these amounts in us treasuries and government agencies  corporate debt  money market funds  commercial paper and municipal bonds meeting certain criteria 
certain of these investments are subject to general credit  liquidity and other market risks 
the general condition of the financial markets and the economy has exacerbated those risks and may affect the value of our current investments and restrict our ability to access the capital markets or even our own funds 
the liquidity of our customers and suppliers may also be affected by the current financial crisis 
if our suppliers experience credit or liquidity problems  important sources of raw materials or manufactured goods may be affected 
if our customers liquidity and creditworthiness is negatively impacted by the current financial crisis and the condition of the economy  our ability to collect on our outstanding invoices and our collection cycles may be adversely affected 
we may not be able to refinance our senior convertible notes 
our million senior convertible notes outstanding at december  are due march and will need to be refinanced before then 
capital markets  including the debt markets  have seen periods of time when liquidity was just not available 
most recently  when the economic crisis hit in there was an extended period of time when the capital markets were illiquid and debt refinancings could not get done 
there can be no guarantee that our financial performance will justify and enable  or that capital markets will be favorable  to allow for a refinancing of this debt 
if a refinancing were prevented or impossible it would have a material adverse impact on our ability to fund  or grow  our existing operations 

table of contents upon the achievement of certain milestones related to our acquisitions  we may be required to make payments which may affect our liquidity and our financial results 
in connection with our recent acquisitions  we may be obligated to make payments in the future upon the achievement of certain milestones 
we currently have million in outstanding potential milestone obligations under our agreement with the shareholders of cervitech and may be required to make milestone payments upon the completion of certain milestones and purchase the remaining sixty percent of progentix orthobiology bv for an aggregate amount up to million effective january   this amount is reduced to million 
the likelihood of those milestones being achieved and the timing of such payments are uncertain and are subject to change over time 
if we are required to make those payments  particularly at a time when we are experiencing financial difficulty  our liquidity  financial results and financial condition may be adversely affected 
risks related to our intellectual property and potential litigation we are currently involved in several patent litigation actions  including an action involving medtronic  and  if we do not prevail in this action against medtronic  we could be liable for past damages and might be prevented from making  using  selling  offering to sell  importing or exporting certain of our products 
on august   medtronic sofamor danek usa  inc and its related entities medtronic filed suit against nuvasive in the united states district court for the southern district of california  alleging that certain of our products infringe  or contribute to the infringement of  us patents owned by medtronic 
medtronic is a large  publicly traded corporation with significantly greater financial resources than us 
as further examples of intellectual property risks we face in this industry  on april   we filed a lawsuit against orthofix  inc and its related entities orthofix and musculoskeletal transplant foundation for infringement of a patent licensed as part of our purchase of osteocel plus 
in december  the parties entered into a license agreement covering the subject product marketed by orthofix  trinity evolution  and the lawsuit was settled by the parties 
similarly  on october   we initiated a patent infringement lawsuit against globus medical  inc globus to protect our investment in our xlif procedure and maxcess retractor system 
the lawsuit against globus is in its early stages  and the outcome of this litigation is difficult to predict 
intellectual property litigation is expensive  complex and lengthy and its outcome is difficult to predict 
we may also be subject to negative publicity due to the litigation 
pending or future patent litigation against us or any strategic partners or licensees may force us or any strategic partners or licensees to stop or delay developing  manufacturing or selling potential products that are claimed to infringe a third party s intellectual property  unless that party grants us or any strategic partners or licensees rights to use its intellectual property  and may significantly divert the attention of our technical and management personnel 
in the event that our right to market any of our products is successfully challenged  and if we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in such cases  we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others in order to continue to commercialize our products 
however  we may not be able to obtain any licenses required under any patents or proprietary rights of third parties on acceptable terms  or at all  and any licenses may require substantial royalties or other payments by us 
even if any strategic partners  licensees or we were able to obtain rights to the third party s intellectual property  these rights may be non exclusive  thereby giving our competitors access to the same intellectual property 
furthermore  if we are found to infringe patent claims of a third party  we may  among other things  be required to pay damages  including up to treble damages and attorney s fees and costs  which may be substantial 
an unfavorable outcome for us in this patent litigation could significantly harm our business if such outcome makes us unable to commercialize some of our current or potential products or cease some of our business operations 
in addition  costs of defense and any damages resulting from the litigation may materially adversely affect our business and financial results 
the litigation may also harm our relationships with existing customers and subject us to negative publicity  each of which could harm our business and financial results 

table of contents our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology through patents and other means is uncertain 
our success depends significantly on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our products 
we rely on patent protection  as well as a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  and nondisclosure  confidentiality and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology 
however  these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage 
for example  our pending us and foreign patent applications may not issue as patents in a form that will be advantageous to us or may issue and be subsequently successfully challenged by others and invalidated 
in addition  our pending patent applications include claims to material aspects of our products and procedures that are not currently protected by issued patents 
both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive 
competitors may be able to design around our patents or develop products which provide outcomes which are comparable to ours 
moreover  competitors may challenge our issued patents through the reexamination process domestically and or opposition proceedings internationally  such as was done by medtronic on two of our us patents related to aspects of our xlif surgical technique 
we asserted these patents against medtronic as part of our ongoing patent litigation 
patent reexamination was granted by the us patent office in each case 
if the us patent office cancels or narrows the claims in these patents  it could prevent or hinder us from being able to enforce them against competitors 
although we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology  including entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our officers  shareowners  consultants and advisors  such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements 
furthermore  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
in addition  there are numerous proposed changes to the patent laws and rules of the us patent and trademark office which  if enacted  may have a significant impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights 
moreover  congress is considering several significant changes to the us patent laws  including  among other things  changing from a first to invent to a first inventor to file system  limiting where a patentee may file a patent suit  requiring the apportionment of patent damages  and creating a post grant opposition process to challenge patents after they have issued 
in the event a competitor infringes upon our patent or other intellectual property rights  enforcing those rights may be costly  difficult and time consuming 
we may not have sufficient resources to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against a challenge 
in addition  certain product categories  including pedicle screws  have been the subject of significant patent litigation in recent years 
since we sell pedicle screws and recently introduced our spherx and armada pedicle screw systems  any related litigation could harm our business 
the medical device industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement 
it is not unusual for parties to exchange letters surrounding allegations of intellectual property infringement and licensing arrangements 
patent litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and its outcome is uncertain 
any claim relating to infringement of patents that is successfully asserted against us may require us to pay substantial damages  including treble damages in some cases 
even if we were to prevail  any litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations 
our success will also depend in part on our not infringing patents issued to others  including our competitors and potential competitors 
if our products are found to infringe the patents of others  our development  manufacture and sale of such potential products could be severely restricted or prohibited 
in addition  our competitors may independently develop technologies similar to ours 
because of the importance of our patent portfolio to our business  we may lose market share to our competitors if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights 
as the number of entrants into our market increases  the possibility of a patent infringement claim against us grows 
while we make an effort to ensure that our products do not infringe other parties patents and proprietary 
table of contents rights  our products and methods may be covered by patents held by our competitors 
in addition  our competitors may assert that future products we may market infringe their patents 
a patent infringement suit brought against us or any of our strategic partners or licensees may force us or such strategic partners or licensees to stop or delay developing  manufacturing or selling potential products that are claimed to infringe a third party s intellectual property  unless that party grants us or our strategic partners or licensees rights to use its intellectual property 
in such cases  we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others in order to continue to commercialize our products 
however  we may not be able to obtain any licenses required under any patents or proprietary rights of third parties on acceptable terms  or at all  and any licenses may require substantial royalties or other payments by us 
even if our strategic partners  licensees or we were able to obtain rights to the third party s intellectual property  these rights may be non exclusive  thereby giving our competitors access to the same intellectual property 
ultimately  we may be unable to commercialize some of our potential products or may have to cease some of our business operations as a result of patent infringement claims  which could severely harm our business 
we are currently involved in a trademark litigation action involving the neurovision brand name and  if we do not prevail on our appeal of the verdict  we could be liable for substantial damages 
a judgment in our ongoing trademark dispute regarding the neurovision brand name was handed down by the us district court for the central district of california 
an unfavorable jury verdict was delivered against us in our use of the neurovision name 
the verdict  which we plan to immediately appeal  awarded damages to the plaintiff of million 
we sought emergency relief and on february   the ninth circuit court of appeals stayed enforcement of the injunction 
during pendency of the appeal  we may be required to post a supersedeas bond or escrow funds to secure the amount of the judgment 
this could result in a material reduction in the liquidity required to run or grow our business 
while this case relates solely to the use of the neurovision brand name and does not involve our proprietary neuromonitoring technology underlying the neurovision system or future products  it may require us to rebrand and re market the neurovision brand name 
this could result in a significant impact on our marketing costs and other related financial costs 
there is a chance that the acceptance of a new brand name will be lengthy and may not be well received by our customers 
the appeals process could be expensive  complex and lengthy and its outcome is difficult to predict 
we may also be subject to negative publicity due to this trademark litigation 
the litigation required during the appeals process may significantly divert the attention of our technical and management personnel 
we are unable to predict the outcome of our appeal 
in the event that we are unsuccessful in our appeal  we could be required to pay significant damages which are not covered under any of our insurance plans 
in the event this outcome occurred  our business  liquidity  financial condition or results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
if we become subject to product liability claims  we may be required to pay damages that exceed our insurance coverage 
our business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the testing  manufacture and sale of medical devices for spine surgery procedures 
spine surgery involves significant risk of serious complications  including bleeding  nerve injury  paralysis and even death 
in addition  we sell allograft products  derived from cadaver bones  which pose the potential risk of biological contamination 
if any such contamination is found to exist  sales of allograft products could decline and our reputation would be harmed 
currently  we maintain product liability insurance in the amount of million 
any product liability claim brought against us  with or without merit  could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates or the inability to secure coverage in the future 
in addition  if our product liability insurance proves to be inadequate to pay a damage award  we may have to pay the excess out of our cash reserves which may harm our financial condition 
if longer term patient results and experience indicate that our products or any component cause tissue damage  motor impairment or other adverse effects  we could be subject to significant liability 
finally  even a meritless or unsuccessful product liability claim could harm our reputation in the industry  lead to significant legal fees and could result in the diversion of management s attention from managing our business 

table of contents we are subject to rigorous governmental regulations regarding the development  manufacture  and sale of our products and we may incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations and develop products that are compatible with these regulations 
in addition  failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to substantial sanctions which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the medical devices we manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal  state and foreign governmental authorities  including regulations that cover the composition  labeling  testing  clinical study  manufacturing  packaging  marketing and distribution of our products 
we are required to register with the fda as a device manufacturer 
as a result  we are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fda s quality system regulation  or qsr  requirements  which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations  including testing  quality control and documentation procedures 
our compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the fda 
in the european community  we are required to maintain certain iso certifications in order to sell our products  and are subject to periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications 
if we or our suppliers fail to adhere to qsr  iso or similar requirements  this could delay product production and lead to fines  difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances  recalls or other consequences  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or prospects 
medical devices must receive fda clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed 
in addition  the fda may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effects of approved products that have been commercialized  and can prevent or limit further marketing of a product based upon the results of post marketing programs 
in addition  the federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or  if a malfunction were to occur  could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury 
furthermore  most major markets for medical devices outside the united states require clearance  approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed 
the process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a medical device  particularly from the fda and certain foreign governmental authorities  can be costly and time consuming  and approvals may not be granted for future products or product improvements on a timely basis  if at all 
delays in receipt of  or failure to obtain  approvals for future products or product improvements could result in delayed realization of product revenues or in substantial additional costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations or prospects 
at any time after approval of a product  the fda may conduct periodic inspections to determine compliance with both qsr requirements and or current medical device reporting regulations 
product approvals by the fda can be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval pursuant to fda regulations  we can only market our products for cleared or approved uses 
although physicians are permitted to use medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the fda based on their medical judgment  we are prohibited from promoting products for such off label uses 
we market our products and provide promotional materials and training programs to physicians regarding the use of our products 
although we believe our marketing  promotional materials and training programs for physicians do not constitute promotion of unapproved uses of our products  if it is determined that our marketing  promotional materials or training programs constitute promotion of unapproved uses  we could be subject to significant fines in addition to regulatory enforcement actions  including the issuance of a warning letter  injunction  seizure and criminal penalty 
whenever the united states or another foreign governmental authority concludes that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations  such governmental authority can impose fines  delay or suspend regulatory clearances  institute proceedings to detain or seize our products  issue a recall  impose operating restrictions  enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees  and can recommend criminal prosecution to the department of justice 
moreover  governmental authorities can ban or request the recall  repair  replacement or refund of the cost of any device or product we manufacture or distribute 
any of the foregoing actions could result in decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability 
table of contents claims  and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
in addition to the sanctions for noncompliance described above  commencement of an enforcement proceeding  inspection or investigation could divert substantial management attention from the operation of our business and have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
any claims relating to our making improper payments or providing improper gifts or benefits to physicians or other potential violations of laws or regulations governing interactions between us and health care professionals  could be time consuming and costly 
our relationship with health care professionals  such as physicians  hospitals and those that may market our products eg  distributors  etc  are subject to scrutiny under various state and federal laws  rules and regulation eg  anti kickback statute  self referral stark laws  false claims  etc  often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws 
these laws are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation  which could require us to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices if they are found not to be in compliance 
violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions  including substantial fines  imprisonment and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs 
despite implementation of a comprehensive healthcare compliance program  we cannot provide assurance that any of the healthcare fraud and abuse laws will not change or be interpreted in the future in a manner which restricts or adversely affects our business activities or relationships with health care professionals nor can we make any assurances that authorities will not challenge or investigate our current or future activities under these laws 
in recent years  both the united states and foreign government regulators have increased regulation  enforcement  inspections and governmental investigations of the medical device industry  including increased united states government oversight and enforcement of the foreign corrupt practices act 
despite implementation of a comprehensive global compliance program  we may be subject to more regulation  enforcement  inspections and investigations by governmental authorities in the future 
whenever the united states or another foreign governmental authority concludes that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations  such governmental authority can impose fines  delay or suspend regulatory clearances  institute proceedings to detain or seize our products  issue a recall  impose operating restrictions  enjoin future violations and assess civil penalties against us or our officers or employees  and can recommend criminal prosecution to the department of justice 
any of the foregoing actions could result in decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims  and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects

for example  synthes  inc  in  settled with the office of inspector general oig for million relating to allegations that it illegally tested bone cement on patients and guidant corporation boston scientific  in  settled with the oig for million relating to alleged improper payments made to physicians for certain post market surveys 
additionally  we must comply with a variety of other laws  such as the i healthcare insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  which protects the privacy of individually identifiable healthcare information  ii the physician payment sunshine act which requires medical device companies to begin reporting all compensation  gifts and benefits provided to certain health care professional in  and iii the federal trade commission act and similar laws regulating advertisement and consumer protections

it is possible that allegations may be made against us or against donor recovery groups or tissue banks  including those with which we have a contractual relationship  claiming that the acquisition or processing of tissue for allograft products does not comply with applicable fda regulations or other relevant statutes and regulations 
allegations like these could cause regulators or other authorities to take investigative or other action against us  or could cause negative publicity for us or our industry in general 
these actions or any negative publicity could cause us to incur substantial costs  divert the attention of our management from our business  harm our reputation and cause the market price of our shares to decline 
risks related to the securities markets and ownership of our common stock we expect that the price of our common stock will fluctuate substantially  potentially adversely affecting the ability of investors to sell their shares 
the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and may fluctuate substantially 
for example  the closing price for our stock on the last day of the past four quarters was on march   on june   on september   and on december  fluctuation in the stock price may occur due to many factors  including general market conditions and other factors such as the effect the financial crisis is having on stock markets as a whole  including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors 
these conditions might include people s expectations  favorable or unfavorable  as to the likely unit growth of the spine sector  negative publicity regarding spine surgeon s practices or outcomes  whether warranted or not  that shed the sector in a negative light  the introduction of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  changes in the availability of third party reimbursement in the united states or other countries  disputes or other developments with respect to intellectual property rights or other potential legal actions  our ability to develop  obtain regulatory clearance or approval for  and market new and enhanced products on a timely basis  quarterly variations in our or our competitor s results of operations  sales of large blocks of our common stock  including sales by our executive officers and directors  announcements of technological or medical innovations for the treatment of spine pathology  changes in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals  clearances or applications  the acquisition or divestiture of businesses  products  assets or technology  litigation  including intellectual property litigation  announcements of actions by the fda or other regulatory agencies  and changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by us or by securities analysts 
market price fluctuations may negatively affect the ability of investors to sell our shares at consistent prices

medtronic sofamor danek usa  inc litigation as reported by us previously  medtronic sofamor danek usa  inc and its related entities medtronic  on august   filed a patent infringement lawsuit against nuvasive in the united states district court for the southern district of california  alleging that certain of nuvasive s products or methods  including the xlif procedure  infringe  or contribute to the infringement of  twelve us patents 
three of the patents were later withdrawn by medtronic leaving the following nine patents in the lawsuit nos 
   assigned or licensed to medtronic medtronic patents 
medtronic is seeking unspecified monetary damages and a court injunction against future infringement by nuvasive 
nuvasive has answered the complaint denying the allegations  and filed counterclaims seeking dismissal of medtronic s complaint and a declaration that nuvasive has not infringed and currently does not infringe any valid claim of the medtronic patents 
additionally  nuvasive has made counterclaims against medtronic seeking the following relief i medtronic being permanently enjoined from charging that nuvasive has infringed or is infringing the medtronic patents  ii a declaration that the medtronic patents are invalid  iii a declaration that the  and  patents are unenforceable due to inequitable conduct  and iv costs and reasonable attorneys fees 
nuvasive filed an amended counterclaim on september   alleging that nuvasive s us patent nos 
  and  are being infringed by medtronic s nim eclipse system and accessories and quadrant products  and dlif direct lateral interbody fusion surgical technique 
medtronic  on june   filed a request for inter partes reexamination with the patent office on nuvasive s us patent no 
 on october   medtronic filed a request for inter partes reexamination on nuvasive s us patent no 
 the patent office granted both requests and issued rejections of the claims 
both reexaminations are pending 
given the number of patents asserted in the litigation  the parties agreed to proceed on a limited number of patents 
the court determined to proceed only with patents that are not the subject of active reexamination proceedings 
as a result  the initial phase of the case includes three medtronic patents and one nuvasive patent 
trial on the initial phase of the case is scheduled to begin may  a full schedule for the second phase of the lawsuit has not yet been set by the court 
trademark infringement litigation in september  neurovision medical products  inc nmp filed suit against nuvasive in the us district court for the central district of california case no 
cv r jem alleging trademark infringement and unfair competition 
nmp sought cancellation of nuvasive s neurovision trademark registrations  injunctive relief and damages based on nmp s common law use of the neurovision mark 
on november   nuvasive denied the allegations in nmp s complaint 
after trial of the matter  on october  an unfavorable jury verdict was delivered against nuvasive relating to our use of the neurovision trade name 
the verdict awarded damages to nmp of million 
on january   the court ordered a judgment be entered in the case in the amount of million  and granted a permanent injunction prohibiting our use of the neurovision name for marketing purposes 
we sought emergency relief  and on february   the ninth circuit court of appeals stayed enforcement of the injunction 
we intend to timely appeal the judgment and permanent injunction 
during pendency of the appeal  we may be required to post a supersedeas bond or escrow funds to secure the amount of the judgment  plus interest  attorneys fees and costs 
however  any payment of damages will be delayed while the appeals process runs its course  which could take up to two years 
we continue to believe that the verdict is not supported by the facts or by applicable law 
based on our own assessment  as well as that of outside counsel  we believe that the trial court committed a number of prejudicial legal errors and that these errors were significant  making the possibility of reversal of the judgment on appeal and or a new trial probable 
accordingly  at december   in accordance with the authoritative guidance on the evaluation of contingencies  we have not recorded an accrual related to this litigation 
we may be required to record an expense related to this damage award in the future

this discussion and analysis may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  such as those set forth under heading risk factors  and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a medical device company focused on developing minimally disruptive surgical products and procedures for the spine 
our currently marketed product portfolio is focused on applications for spine fusion surgery  including biologics  a combined market estimated to exceed billion globally in our principal product offering includes a minimally disruptive surgical platform called maximum access surgery  or mas  as well as a growing offering of biologics  cervical and motion preservation products 
our spine surgery product line offerings  which include products for the thoracolumbar spine  the cervical spine  and a set of motion preservation product offerings still under development  are primarily used to enable access to the spine and to perform restorative and fusion procedures in a minimally disruptive fashion 
our biologic product line offerings include allograft donated human tissue  formagraft  a collagen synthetic product used to aid the fusion process  and osteocel plus tm  an allograft cellular matrix containing viable mesenchymal stem cells  or mscs  to aid in spinal fusion 
we focus significant research and development efforts to expand our mas product platform  advance the applications of our unique technology to additional procedures and develop motion preserving products such as our total disc replacement products 
we dedicate significant resources toward training spine surgeons on our unique technology and products 
currently  we are training over surgeons annually  which includes surgeons new to our mas product platform as well as surgeons previously trained on our mas product platform who are attending advanced training programs 
our mas platform  with the unique advantages provided by our nerve monitoring systems  enables an innovative lateral procedure known as extreme lateral interbody fusion  or xlif  in which surgeons access the spine for a fusion procedure from the side of the patient s body  rather than from the front or back 
our maxcess instruments provide access to the spine in a manner that affords direct visualization and our nerve monitoring systems allow surgeons to avoid critical nerves 
at various times over the past two years  certain insurance providers have adopted policies of not providing reimbursement for the xlif procedure 
we have worked with our surgeon customers and the north american spine society nass who  in turn  have worked with these insurance providers to supply the information  explanation and clinical data they require to categorize the xlif procedure as a procedure entitled to reimbursement under their policies 
at present  all major insurance companies provide reimbursement for xlif procedures  including aetna  cigna  humana  health care service corporation  and united healthcare  each of whom has reversed their prior policy of non coverage 
certain smaller regional carriers  however  have policies against coverage of xlif 
nuvasive cannot offer definitive time frames or final outcomes regarding reversal of the non coverage policies  as the process is dictated by the third party insurance providers 
to date  we have not experienced significant lack of payment for our procedures based on these policies 
in recent years  we have significantly expanded our product offering relating to procedures in the cervical spine as well as in the area of biologics 
our cervical product offering now provides a full set of solutions for cervical fusion surgery  including both allograft and coroent implants  as well as cervical plating and posterior fixation products 
in  we acquired cervitech inc  a company focused on gaining regulatory approval of the pcm cervical disc system  a motion preserving total disc replacement device 
this strategic acquisition allows us the potential to accelerate our entry into the growing mechanical cervical disc replacement market 
in the first quarter of  we submitted a pma application for us food and drug administration fda approval for the pcm cervical disc system 
approval  if obtained  would further strengthen our cervical product offering and should enable us to continue our trend of increasing our market share 

table of contents in  we purchased forty percent of the capital stock of progentix orthobiology  bv progentix  a company organized under the laws of the netherlands  from existing shareholders for million in cash the initial investment 
progentix has as its objective the development and exploitation of knowledge and technology in the field of synthetic bone graft materials to aid in the healing and generation of human bone 
we have an active product development pipeline focused on expanding our current fusion product platform as well as products designed to preserve spinal motion 
revenues 
the majority of our revenues are derived from the sale of disposables and implants and we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
we loan our proprietary software driven nerve monitoring systems and surgical instrument sets at no cost to surgeons and hospitals that purchase disposables and implants for use in individual procedures 
in addition  we place our proprietary software driven nerve monitoring systems  maxcess and other mas or cervical surgical instrument sets with hospitals for an extended period at no up front cost to them 
our implants and disposables are currently sold and shipped from our primary distribution and warehousing operations facility located in memphis  tennessee 
we recognize revenue for disposables or implants used upon receiving acknowledgement of a purchase order from the hospital indicating product use or implantation 
in addition  we sell an immaterial number of mas instrument sets  maxcess devices  and our proprietary software driven nerve monitoring systems 
to date  we have derived less than of our total revenues from these sales 
sales and marketing 
through  substantially all of our operations are located in the united states and substantially all of our sales have been generated in the united states 
we sell our products in the united states through a sales force comprised of exclusive independent sales agents and our own directly employed sales professionals  both selling only nuvasive spine surgery products 
our sales force provides a delivery and consultative service to our surgeon and hospital customers and is compensated based on sales and product placements in their territories 
sales force commissions are reflected in our statement of operations in the sales  marketing and administrative expense line 
we expect to continue to expand our distribution channel 
beginning late in and continuing today  we are continuing our expansion of international sales efforts with the focus on european  asian and latin american markets 
our international sales force is comprised of directly employed exclusive shareowners as well as exclusive distributors and independent sales agents 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to bad debts  inventories  valuation of goodwill  intangibles and other long term assets  income taxes  legal proceedings  and stock compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we follow the provisions of the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which sets forth guidelines for the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payment and customer acceptance 
we recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
specifically  revenue from the sale of implants and disposables is recognized upon acknowledgement of a purchase order from the hospital indicating product use or implantation or upon shipment to third party customers who immediately accept title 
revenue from the sale of our instrument sets is recognized upon receipt of a purchase order and the subsequent shipment to customers who immediately accept title 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts and sales return reserve 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed quarterly and is estimated based on the aging of account balances  collection history and known trends with current customers and in the economy in general 
as a result of this review  the allowance is adjusted on a specific identification basis 
an increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts results in a corresponding charge to sales  marketing and administrative expense 
we maintain a relatively large customer base that mitigates the risk of concentration with any one particular customer 
however  if the overall condition of the healthcare industry were to deteriorate  or if the historical data used to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not accurately reflect our customer s future failure to pay outstanding receivables  significant additional allowances could be required 
in addition  we establish a reserve for estimated sales returns that is recorded as a reduction to revenue 
this reserve is maintained to account for future return of products sold in the current period 
this reserve is reviewed quarterly and is estimated based on an analysis of our historical experience related to product returns 
excess and obsolete inventory 
we provide an inventory reserve for estimated obsolescence and excess inventory based upon historical turnover and assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
our allograft products have shelf lives ranging from two to four years and are subject to demand fluctuations based on the availability and demand for alternative products 
our inventory  which consists primarily of disposables and specialized implants  is at risk of obsolescence following the introduction and development of new or enhanced products 
our estimates and assumptions for excess and obsolete inventory are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
the estimates we use for demand are also used for near term capacity planning and inventory purchasing and are consistent with our revenue forecasts 
increases in the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory result in a corresponding charge to cost of goods sold 
a stated goal of our business is to focus on continual product innovation and to obsolete our own products 
while we believe this provides a competitive edge  it also results in the risk that our products and related capital instruments will become obsolete prior to sale or to the end of their anticipated useful lives 
if we introduce new products or next generation products  we may be required to dispose of existing inventory prior to the end of its estimated useful life and or write off the value or accelerate the depreciation of the capital instruments 
accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized 
a valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be achieved 
the evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance is performed on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  and includes a review of all available positive and negative evidence 
factors reviewed include projections of pre tax book income for the foreseeable future  determination of cumulative pre tax book income after permanent differences  earnings history  and reliability of forecasting 
during the fourth quarter of  we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize the benefit of our domestic deferred tax assets in the future 
we based this conclusion on historical and projected operating performance  as well as our expectation that our operations will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the tax benefits associated with the deferred tax assets 
as a result  we released the valuation allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets 
we will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets by evaluating both positive and negative evidence that may exist 
any adjustment to the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded in the income statement for the period that the adjustment is determined to be required 
valuation of stock based compensation 
the estimated fair value of share based awards exchanged for shareowner employee and non employee director services are expensed over the requisite service period 
option awards issued to non employees excluding non employee directors are recorded at their fair value as determined in accordance with authoritative guidance  and are periodically revalued as the options vest and are recognized as expense over the related service period 
for purposes of calculating stock based compensation  we estimate the fair value of stock options and shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan using a black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of 
table of contents the fair value of share based payment awards utilizing the black scholes model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected term of the stock options 
the expected life of the stock options is based on historical and other economic data trended into the future 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the expected terms of our stock options 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of no dividend payouts 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
if there is a difference between the assumptions used in determining stock based compensation expense and the actual factors which become known over time  specifically with respect to anticipated forfeitures  we may change the input factors used in determining stock based compensation costs for future grants 
these changes  if any  may materially impact our results of operations in the period such changes are made 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 
our goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired from our business combinations 
our intangible assets are comprised primarily of acquired technology  in process research and development  manufacturing know how  licensed technology  supply agreements and trade names and trademarks 
we make significant judgments in relation to the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets resulting from business combinations and asset acquisitions 
the determination of the value of goodwill and intangible assets arising from business combinations and asset acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development ipr d 
goodwill and ipr d are not amortized 
the value and useful lives assigned to other acquired intangible assets impact future amortization 
authoritative guidance requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques on an annual basis or more frequently if facts and circumstance warrant such a review 
for purposes of assessing the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  the company estimates the value of the reporting unit using its market capitalization as the best evidence of fair value 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then a goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
we performed our annual test of goodwill during the fourth quarter of  and have determined there has been no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives through december  we evaluate our intangible assets with finite lives for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets consist of purchased technology  trademarks and trade names  customer relationships and agreements  manufacturing know how and other intangibles and are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of two to years 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life 
if this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining amortization period  we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the remaining amortization period 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results 
we have not recognized any impairment charges on our intangible assets through december  legal proceedings 
we are involved in a number of legal actions involving both product liability and intellectual property disputes 
the outcomes of these legal actions are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time 
in some actions  the claimants seek damages as well as other relief  including injunctions barring the sale of products that are the subject of the lawsuit  that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues 
in accordance with authoritative guidance  we record a liability in our 
table of contents consolidated financial statements for these actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
if the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range  and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other  the minimum amount of the range is accrued 
if a loss is possible  but not known or probable  and can be reasonably estimated  the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in most cases  significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded 
our significant legal proceedings are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
while it is not possible to predict the outcome for the matters discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we believe it is possible that costs associated with them could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated earnings  financial position or cash flows 
property and equipment 
property and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives 
we depreciate the instrument sets that we loan to or place with hospitals over an estimated useful life of three years 
if we introduce new products or next generation products  we may be required to dispose of loaned instrument sets prior to the end of their estimated useful life and or write off the value or accelerate the depreciation of the these assets 
maintenance and repairs on all property and equipment are expensed as incurred 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies

our biologic product line offerings include allograft donated human tissue  formagraft  a collagen synthetic product used to aid the fusion process  and osteocel plus  an allograft cellular matrix containing viable mesenchymal stem cells  or mscs  to aid in spinal fusion 
the continued adoption of minimally invasive procedures for spine has led to the continued expansion of our innovative lateral procedure known as extreme lateral interbody fusion  or xlif  in which surgeons access the spine for a fusion procedure from the side of the patient s body  rather than from the front or back 
the execution of our strategy of expanding our product offering for the lumbar region and addressing broader indications further up the spine in the thoracic and cervical regions has contributed to strong revenue growth 
in addition  increased market acceptance in our international markets contributed to the increase in revenues noted for the periods presented 
we expect the continued adoption of our xlif procedure and deeper penetration into existing accounts and our newer international markets as our sales force executes on the strategy of selling the full mix of our products  however  recent changes in payer and hospital behavior in the united states have created less predictability in the lumbar portion of the spine market and impacted the overall spine market s growth rate 
accordingly  we believe that our growth in revenue in will primarily come from increased sales of our cervical offerings  our biologics product line and in our international businesses 
our total revenues increased million in compared to and million in compared to  representing total revenue growth of and  respectively

cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue increased slightly in over and over  primarily from the greater contributions to revenue from our lower margin biologics product line  lower margin international businesses and mix shifting within the remainder of the domestic product portfolio 
we expect cost of goods sold  as a percentage of revenue  to increase slightly to approximately due to the expected continued increased revenue contribution from our lower margin biologics and international businesses  and impacts from pricing

the increases in sales  marketing and administrative expenses principally result from growth in our revenue and the overall growth of the company  including expenses that tend to vary based on revenue such as commissions  depreciation expense for loaned surgical instrument sets  worldwide sales force headcount and shipping  expenses associated with investments in our worldwide infrastructure such as operating systems and real estate  legal expenses  and non sales related headcount growth 
as a percentage of revenue  sales  marketing and administrative expenses decreased in and compared to the prior years principally from operating leverage in our expenses  as well as lower performance based compensation  relative to the growth in revenue in compared to the prior year

stock based compensation increased million and million in and  respectively  compared to prior years primarily related to an increase in stock based awards granted to shareowners associated with the continued increase in headcount 
these increases in expenses were also offset by decreases in costs for compared to related to charges totaling million incurred for non capitalizable expenses related to the implementation of our new erp system which was completed in 
table of contents in addition to the items discussed above  legal expenses increased million in as compared to resulting primarily from increased non medtronic related litigation and legal activity including recently announced offensive actions to protect our intellectual property and defense costs incurred in connection with the neurovision trademark infringement litigation 
legal expenses increased million in as compared to primarily from expenses incurred in connection with the medtronic intellectual property suit that was filed against us in with which we have now taken an offensive posture 
these increased expenses were partially offset by the recovery of an international receivable in the amount of million in which had previously been reserved for in during the first quarter of  we adopted the financial accounting standard board s fasb revised authoritative guidance for business combinations  which requires that acquisition related costs be expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred 
this differs from previous accounting treatment in that the acquisition related expenses were included as part of the purchase price of the acquired company 
we incurred expenses of approximately million in acquisition related costs in connection with our investment in progentix and acquisition of cervitech in in connection with the relocation of our corporate headquarters in  we recorded a charge of approximately million to sales  marketing  and administrative expenses for lease termination costs and other related items 
during  due to continued growth  we decided to reoccupy the former corporate headquarters facility 
accordingly  in  the remaining liability related to lease termination costs of million was reversed and recorded as a reduction of sales  marketing  and administrative expenses

in the last several years  we have introduced numerous new products and product enhancements that have significantly expanded our mas platform  enhanced the applications of the xlif procedure  expanded our offering of cervical products  and moved closer to entering into the growing motion preservation market 
we have also acquired complementary and strategic assets and technology  particularly in the area of biologics 
we are developing proprietary total disc replacement devices for lateral lumbar spine applications and separately for cervical spine applications  which are currently in different phases of clinical trials and related studies 
we anticipate continuing to incur costs related to such clinical trials and studies through at least compensation and other shareowner related expenses increased million for as increased compensation and other shareowner related expenses resulting from additions to the company s headcount were partially offset by a decrease in performance based compensation for as compared to compensation and other shareowner related expenses increased million for  including an increase in stock based compensation of million  primarily due to increased headcount to support our product development and enhancement efforts  as compared to in addition  expenses related to ongoing clinical trial and study related activities designed to demonstrate the value of our emerging and existing technologies increased million and million for and  respectively  compared to the prior years 
in addition  expenses increased million in as compared to as a result of expenses incurred in connection with a supply agreement related to the bone graft product being developed by progentix and an additional technology acquisition 
in  other research related expenses increased million as compared to  including million in research expenses related to our investment in progentix

table of contents amortization of intangible assets year ended december  to to change change change change dollars in thousands amortization of intangible assets of total revenue amortization of intangible assets relates to amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired 
amortization expense remained relatively constant in as compared to  however the increase in amortization expense in compared to is due to the increased acquisition activity undertaken in and we expect expenses recorded in connection with the amortization of intangible assets to continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as amortization of acquired in process research and development commences once acquired research and development projects reach technological feasibility 
in process research and development year ended december  to to change change change change dollars in thousands in process research and development of total revenue during  we recorded in process research and development ipr d charges of million related to the acquisitions of pedicle screw technology and osteocel plus 
as of the date of the acquisitions  the projects associated with the ipr d efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility and the in process research and development had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  the amounts were charged to expense on the acquisition dates in accordance with the authoritative guidance in effect on the dates of acquisition 
during the first quarter of  we adopted the fasb s revised authoritative guidance for business combinations  which is applied prospectively for all new business acquisitions entered into after january  and provides that ipr d acquired is no longer charged to expense on the acquisition date  but rather recorded as an asset on the balance sheet 
amounts recorded as ipr d beginning after january   will begin being amortized upon first sales of the product over the estimated useful life of the technology 
as of december   we have approximately million on our balance sheet related to ipr d in conjunction with our investment in progentix and acquisition of cervitech as regulatory approval has not yet been obtained 
in accordance with authoritative guidance  as the technology has not yet been proven  the amortization of the acquired ipr d has not begun 
in the first quarter of  we submitted a pma application for us food and drug administration fda approval for the pcm cervical disc system acquired from cervitech  which represents approximately million of the million total capitalized ipr d 
in addition  we are currently in the process of seeking regulatory clearance for attrax  a product being developed by progentix  which represents the remaining million of the million total capitalized ipr d 
interest and other income expense  net year ended december  to to change change change change dollars in thousands interest income interest expense other income  net total interest and other income expense  net of total revenue interest and other income expense  net  consists primarily of interest income earned on marketable securities offset by interest expense incurred related to the company s convertible debt financing established in march the million net change in these amounts in as compared to is principally due to a decrease of million in interest income due to lower interest rates in the million net change in as compared to 
table of contents is due primarily to i an increase in interest expense of million in as compared to related to the convertible debt offering due to having a full year of interest expense in the period as compared to only a partial year during the period and ii a decrease in interest income of million in as compared to due to both lower interest rates and lower average balances in marketable securities in as compared to income tax benefit expense year ended december  to to change change change change dollars in thousands income tax benefit expense effective income tax benefit rate the effective income tax benefit rate for was approximately compared to an effective income tax rate of for the income tax benefit for includes federal  state and foreign income tax expense  offset by the reversal of a valuation allowance totaling million 
we generated pre tax book income in both and as a result of this positive earnings trend  three years of cumulative profits and projected future taxable income  we determined that it was more likely than not that our domestic deferred tax assets would be realized and  accordingly  we reversed a valuation allowance totaling approximately million that was recorded against these deferred tax assets million of the reversal resulted in a benefit recorded to additional paid in capital 
excluding the impact of this reversal of the valuation allowance  the effective income tax rate for would have differed from the us federal statutory rate of due to state income taxes  net of federal benefit  and non deductible stock award compensation in the effective tax rate for was approximately  which differed from the us federal statutory rate of due primarily to state income taxes  net of federal benefit  and non deductible stock award compensation in the effective income tax rate for was nil as the company was in a net operating loss position and maintained a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
we are subject to audits by federal  state  local  and foreign tax authorities 
we believe that adequate provisions have been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations 
however  the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty 
should any issues addressed in our tax audits be resolved in a manner not consistent with management s expectations  we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs 
we will continue to assess the likelihood of realization of our tax credits and other net deferred tax assets 
if future events occur that do not make the realization of such assets more likely than not  a valuation allowance will be established against all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets 
we expect our effective income tax rate to exceed the us federal and state statutory income tax rates primarily due to non deductible expenses and foreign losses expected to be incurred by progentix 
stock based compensation the compensation expense that has been included in the statement of operations for all share based compensation arrangements was as follows year ended december  to to change change change change dollars in thousands stock based compensation sales  marketing administrative research development total stock based compensation of total revenue stock based compensation related to stock awards is recognized and amortized on an accelerated basis in accordance with authoritative guidance 
the increase in stock based compensation of approximately million in as compared to and million in as compared  can be primarily attributed to an increase in the number of awards due to increased headcount year over year for all years presented 
in addition  during  we 
table of contents began granting restricted stock units rsus which tend to have higher associated stock based compensation expense as they are valued at the full market price on the day of grant 
as of december   there was million and million of unrecognized compensation expense for stock options and rsus  respectively  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years and years  respectively 
in addition  as of december   there was million of unrecognized compensation expense for shares expected to be issued under the employee stock purchase plan which is expected to be recognized through october business combinations and asset acquisitions investment in progentix orthobiology  bv on january   we completed the purchase of forty percent of the capital stock of progentix orthobiology  bv  a company organized under the laws of the netherlands progentix  from existing shareholders the progentix shareholders pursuant to a preferred stock purchase agreement 
nuvasive  progentix and the progentix shareholders also entered into an option purchase agreement dated january  the option agreement  whereby i the progentix shareholders have two separate rights  upon the achievement of pre defined development milestones by progentix or sales milestones by us  to cause us to purchase the remaining sixty percent of capital stock of progentix remaining shares at pre defined prices the put options  and ii we have the right  upon the occurrence of pre defined events  to purchase the remaining sixty percent of capital stock of progentix the call option 
we also entered into a distribution agreement with progentix dated january   whereby progentix appointed us as its exclusive distributor for certain progentix products 
in accordance with authoritative guidance issued by the fasb  we determined that progentix is a variable interest entity vie and that we are the primary beneficiary 
accordingly  the financial position and results of operations of progentix have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of the initial investment 
the equity interests in progentix not owned by us are reported as noncontrolling interests on our consolidated balance sheet 
losses incurred by progentix are charged to us and to the noncontrolling interest holders based on their ownership percentage 
the remaining shares and the option agreement that was entered into between us  progentix and the progentix shareholders are not considered to be freestanding financial instruments as defined by authoritative guidance 
therefore the remaining shares and the option agreement are accounted for as a combined unit in the consolidated financial statements as a redeemable noncontrolling interest that was initially recorded at fair value and classified as mezzanine equity 
on december   we entered into an amendment the amendment to the option agreement and the distribution agreement with progentix and the progentix shareholders in connection with the execution of an exclusive supply agreement between us and ceremed  inc the amendment  among other things  extends by five months the period of time allotted for the achievement of each of the milestones required to trigger the put options  reduces the transfer price paid to progentix by us for the supply of product  and also reduces by up to million the purchase price to be paid by us upon execution of either of the put options or the call option 
as the remaining shares and the option agreement are accounted for as a combined unit in the consolidated financial statements  the amendment resulted in the retirement of the noncontrolling equity interests originally recorded in january  and in accordance with authoritative guidance  the noncontrolling equity interests were recorded at fair value as of december   the date of the amendment 
the fair value of the equity interests issued on december  approximated the carrying value of the noncontrolling equity interests on that date

of the total purchase price of million  million and million was allocated to in process research and development and goodwill  respectively  based on management s valuation of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the date of acquisition 
this strategic acquisition allows us the potential to accelerate our entry into the growing mechanical cervical disc replacement market 
we submitted a pma for fda approval in the first quarter of approval  if obtained  should further strengthen our cervical product offering and will enable us to continue our trend of increasing our market share 

table of contents acquisition of osteocel biologics business 
in july  we completed the acquisition of certain assets of osiris therapeutics  inc the osteocel biologics business acquisition 
the transaction provides us with an allograft cellular matrix that is designed to mimic the biologic profile of autograft  as well as rights to acquire the next generation cultured version of the product 
osteocel plus is a unique bone matrix product that contains viable mesenchymal stem cells  or mscs  to aid in spinal fusion and provides the three beneficial properties similar to autograft osteoconduction provides a scaffold for bone growth  osteoinduction bone formation stimulation and osteogenesis bone production 
osteocel plus is designed to allow surgeons to offer the benefits of these properties to patients without the discomfort and potential complications of autograft harvesting  in addition to eliminating the time spent on a secondary surgical procedure 
osteocel plus is produced for use in spinal applications through a proprietary processing method that preserves the endogenous cells 
the acquisition is consistent with our objective of developing or acquiring innovative technologies 
of the total purchase price of million  million was paid to osiris at closing the initial purchase price and additional payments totaling million were made in cash and through the issuance of shares of our common stock through of the total purchase price  million was allocated to in process research and development  and recorded in expense in  as the associated projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses

liquidity  cash flows and capital resources liquidity and capital resources since our inception in  we have incurred significant losses and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
through  our operations were funded primarily with proceeds from the sale of our equity securities  which at december   totaled million since inception  including million sold in the public markets 
since  our operations have been funded primarily with our convertible debt proceeds issued in march as well as the positive cash flow generated from operations 
in march  we issued million principal amount of senior convertible notes due the notes 
the net proceeds from the offering  after deducting the initial purchasers discount and costs directly related to the offering  were approximately million 
we pay interest per annum on the principal amount of the notes  payable semi annually in arrears in cash on march and september of each year 
any notes not converted prior to march   the maturity date  will be paid in cash 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities was million and million at december  and at december   respectively 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts  the expansion of sales  marketing and administrative activities  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  the continuing market acceptance of our products and the expenditures associated with possible future acquisitions or other business combination transactions 
we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results and working capital requirements 
in addition  as more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  we may be required to post a supersedeas bond or escrow fund to secure the recent million judgment against us in connection with the neurovision trademark infringement litigation

cash flows used in investing activities cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to million in the million decrease in cash used in investing activities in as compared to is primarily due to a decrease in cash used for acquisitions and investments in compared to as the acquisition of cervitech  inc and our investment in progentix were completed in with no comparable investments in  and a net decrease in our investing activities 
these decreases in spending were offset by increased purchases of surgical instrument sets  which are deployed to support our increasing revenue volume  and increased expenditures in infrastructure related to the addition of our new york facility and expansion of our memphis facility

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity and risk 
our exposure to interest rate risk at december  is related to our investment portfolio which consists largely of debt instruments of high quality corporate issuers and the us government and its agencies 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we have assessed that there is no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
fixed rate investments and borrowings may have their fair market value adversely impacted from changes in interest rates 
at december   we do not hold any material asset backed investment securities and in  we did not realize any losses related to asset backed investment securities 
based upon our overall interest rate exposure as of december   a change of percent in interest rates  assuming the amount of our investment portfolio remains constant  would not have a 
table of contents material effect on interest expense 
further  this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
we have operated mainly in the united states of america  and the majority of our sales since inception have been made in us dollars 
accordingly  we have assessed that we do not have any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve the principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing the risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy 
none of our investments are held for trading purposes 
our policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of instrument

these investments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
market price sensitive instruments 
in order to reduce the potential equity dilution  we entered into convertible note hedge transactions the hedge entitling us to purchase up to million shares of our common stock at an initial stock price of per share  each of which is subject to adjustment 
upon conversion of our senior convertible notes  the hedge is expected to reduce the equity dilution if the daily volume weighted average price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the hedge 
we also entered into warrant transactions with the counterparties of the hedge entitling them to acquire up to million shares of our common stock  subject to adjustment  at an initial strike price of per share  subject to adjustment 
the warrant transactions could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock during a given measurement period the quarter or year to date period at maturity of the warrants exceeds the strike price of the warrants
