overview we are a modern american upscale casual restaurant chain 
as of february   we operated restaurants in midwestern states featuring on premises breweries  substantially all of which operate under the name of granite city food brewery 
we believe our menu features high quality yet affordable family favorite menu items prepared from made from scratch recipes and served in generous portions 
we believe that the sophisticated yet unpretentious restaurants  proprietary food and beverage products  attractive price points and high service standards combine for a great dining experience 
our industry can be significantly affected by changes in economic conditions  discretionary spending patterns  consumer tastes  and cost fluctuations 
over the past two years  consumers have been under increased economic pressures and as a result  many have changed their discretionary spending patterns 
many consumers are dining out less frequently than in the past and or have decreased the amount they spend on meals while dining out 
to offset the negative impact of decreased sales  we undertook a series of initiatives to renegotiate the pricing of various aspects of our business  effectively reducing our cost of food  insurance  payroll processing  shipping  supplies and our property and equipment rent 
we have implemented marketing initiatives designed to increase brand awareness and help drive guest traffic 
we believe these initiatives contributed to the increase in sales and guest traffic in fiscal year we believe that our operating results will fluctuate significantly because of several factors  including the operating results of our restaurants  changes in food and labor costs  increases or decreases in comparable restaurant sales  general economic conditions  consumer confidence in the economy  changes in consumer preferences  nutritional concerns and discretionary spending patterns  competitive factors  the skill and the experience of our restaurant level management teams  the maturity of each restaurant  adverse weather conditions in our markets  our ability to recommence our expansion plans  and the timing of any future restaurant openings and related expenses 

table of contents we use a week fiscal year ending on the last tuesday of december to account for our operations 
all references to and within the following discussion represent the fiscal years ended december  and december   respectively 
fiscal years and each consisted of weeks 
our fiscal year ended december  included  operating weeks  which is the sum of the actual number of weeks each restaurant operated 
our fiscal year ended december  included  restaurant weeks because our indianapolis  indiana restaurant opened for business six weeks into fiscal year we provide the statistical measure of restaurant weeks to enhance the comparison of revenue from period to period as changes occur in the number of restaurants we are operating 
our restaurant revenue is comprised almost entirely of the sales of food and beverages 
the sale of retail items typically represents less than one percent of total revenue 
product costs include the costs of food  beverages and retail items 
labor costs include direct hourly and management wages  taxes and benefits for restaurant employees 
direct and occupancy costs include restaurant supplies  marketing costs  rent  utilities  real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance and other related costs 
pre opening costs consist of direct costs related to hiring and training the initial restaurant workforce  the salaries and related costs of our new store opening team  rent expense incurred during the construction period and other direct costs associated with opening new restaurants 
general and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses associated with all corporate and administrative functions that support existing operations  which include management and staff salaries  employee benefits  travel  information systems  training  market research  professional fees  supplies and corporate rent 
depreciation and amortization includes depreciation on capital expenditures at the restaurant and corporate levels and amortization of intangibles that do not have indefinite lives 
interest expense represents the cost of interest expense on debt and capital leases net of interest income on invested assets 
results of operations as a percentage of sales the following table sets forth results of our operations expressed as a percentage of sales for fiscal years and fiscal year ended december  december  restaurant revenue cost of sales food  beverage and retail labor direct restaurant operating occupancy total cost of sales pre opening general and administrative depreciation and amortization exit or disposal activities loss gain on disposal of assets operating loss interest income expense net interest expense net loss certain percentage amounts do not sum due to rounding 

table of contents critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
these principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  actual results and the timing of the recognition of such amounts could differ from those estimates 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates utilized by management in the preparation of our financial statements property and equipment the cost of property and equipment is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets ranging from three to years 
the cost of leasehold improvements is depreciated over the initial term of the related lease  which is generally to years 
depreciation is computed on the straight line method for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for income tax purposes 
amortization of assets acquired under capital lease is included in depreciation expense 
we review property and equipment  including leasehold improvements  for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired pursuant the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting guidance on accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we base this assessment upon the carrying value versus the fair market value of the asset and whether or not that difference is recoverable 
such assessment is performed on a restaurant by restaurant basis and includes other relevant facts and circumstances including the physical condition of the asset 
our accounting policies regarding property and equipment include certain management judgments regarding the estimated useful lives of such assets and the determination as to what constitutes enhancing the value of or increasing the life of existing assets 
these judgments and estimates may produce materially different amounts of depreciation and amortization expense than would be reported if different assumptions were used 
we continually reassess our assumptions and judgments and make adjustments when significant facts and circumstances dictate 
historically  actual results have not been materially different than the estimates we have made 
leasing activities we have entered into various leases for our buildings  equipment and for ground leases 
at the inception of a lease  we evaluate it to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease pursuant to the fasb guidance on accounting for leases 
our lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we take possession of the leased premises through the termination date 
there is potential for variability in our rent holiday period which begins on the date the lease agreement is signed and ends on the date the restaurant opens  during which no cash rent payments are typically due 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally relate to construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant opening will result in greater pre opening rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period 
certain leases contain provisions that require additional rent payments based upon restaurants sales volume contingent rentals 
contingent rentals are accrued each period as the liabilities are incurred 
management makes judgments regarding the probable term for each restaurant property lease which can impact the classification and account for a lease as capital or operating 
these judgments 
table of contents may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  rent expense and interest expense than would be reported if different assumptions were made 
stock based compensation we have granted stock options to certain employees and non employee directors 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fasb fair value recognition guidance 
stock based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the vesting period 
under the black scholes option pricing model  we determine the fair value of stock based compensation at the grant date 
this requires judgment  including but not limited to judgment concerning the expected volatility and forfeiture of our stock 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
revenue recognition revenue is derived from the sale of prepared food and beverage and select retail items and is recognized at the time of sale 
revenue derived from gift card sales is recognized at the time the gift card is redeemed 
until the redemption of gift cards occurs  the outstanding balances on such cards are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
when we determine there is no legal obligation to remit the value of unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdictions  we periodically recognize gift card breakage which represents the portion of our gift card obligation for which management believes the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote  based upon historical redemption patterns 
such amounts are included as a reduction to general and administrative expense 
we arrive at this amount using certain management judgments and estimates 
such judgments and estimates may produce different amounts of breakage than would be reported if different assumptions were used 
estimated liability for closing restaurants we continually evaluate the performance of each of our restaurants 
if a restaurant consistently performs poorly  we consider many factors including the demographics of the location and the likelihood of being able to improve the performance of the restaurant 
if we determine that the restaurant will not  within a reasonable period of time  perform to our expectations  we may close the restaurant 
in the event we close a restaurant  we record the liability to cover future lease termination costs using the fair value of these liabilities as estimated in accordance with the fasb guidance on accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this estimate is generally based on the term of the lease and the lease termination fee we expect to pay 
the amount of the estimated liability established is generally the present value of these estimated future minimum lease payments offset by the estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained upon exiting the property 
a significant assumption we use in determining the amount of the estimated liability for closing a restaurant is the amount of the estimated liability for future lease payments on vacant restaurants  determined based on the likelihood of successfully negotiating an early termination of the lease agreement with our landlord or subleasing the property 
if it takes longer than anticipated to terminate or sublease the lease  we may need to record additional estimated liability 
if the lease on the vacant restaurant is not terminated or subleased on the terms we used to estimate the liability  we may be required to record losses in future periods 
conversely  if the lease on the vacant restaurant is terminated or subleased on more favorable terms than we used to estimate the liability  we would reverse all or some portion of the previously established estimated liability  resulting in an increase in operating income 

table of contents results of operations for the fiscal years ended december  and december  revenue we generated  and  of revenue during fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in revenue was primarily the result of an increase in guest traffic of approximately 
fiscal year included six additional restaurant operating weeks compared to the fiscal year comparable restaurant revenue increased from to primarily due to an increase in guest traffic of approximately 
average weekly revenue per comparable restaurant increased  from  in to  in throughout and particularly in the last half of the year  we began a discounting and a marketing program to drive guest traffic back into the restaurants 
although the discounting reduced our average check on a year to date basis  our guest traffic improved in late and in we expect that restaurant revenue will vary from quarter to quarter 
continued seasonal fluctuations in restaurant revenue are due in part to increased outdoor seating and weather conditions 
due to the honeymoon effect that periodically occurs with the opening of a restaurant  we expect the timing of any future restaurant openings to cause fluctuations in restaurant revenue 
additionally  other factors outside of our control  such as timing of holidays  consumer confidence in the economy and changes in consumer preferences may affect our future revenue 
restaurant costs food and beverage our food and beverage costs  as a percentage of revenue  increased to in from in while we experienced slight cost increases  primarily in bottled beer  fish  chicken and dairy  such costs were offset in part by decreases in wine  liquor  tap beer and soft drink costs 
while pricing negotiations with our suppliers have reduced our exposure to commodity price increases  we do expect that our food and beverage costs will continue to vary going forward due to numerous variables  including seasonal changes in food and beverage costs for which we do not have contracted pricing  fluctuations within commodity priced goods and guest preferences 
we periodically create new menu offerings and introduce new craft brewed beers based upon guest preferences 
although such menu modifications may temporarily result in increased food and beverage cost  we believe we are able to offset such increases with our weekly specials which provide variety and value to our guests 
our varieties of craft brewed beer  which we believe we can produce at lower cost than beers we purchase for resale  also enable us to keep our food and beverage costs low while fulfilling guest requests and building customer loyalty 
labor labor expense consists of restaurant management salaries  hourly staff payroll costs  other payroll related items including management bonuses  and non cash stock based compensation expense 
our experience to date has been that staff labor costs associated with a newly opened restaurant  for approximately its first four to six months of operation  are greater than what can be expected after that time  both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue 
our labor costs  as a percentage of revenue  decreased as a percentage of revenue to in from in we have not opened additional restaurants since the first quarter of  and therefore we did not incur additional labor costs typically associated with newly opened restaurants in the additionally  we have trained our managers on a number of operational metrics and initiatives focused on manager accountability and internal development of restaurant level staff to reduce labor costs as a percentage of revenue 

table of contents we expect that labor costs will vary as minimum wage laws  local labor laws and practices  and unemployment rates vary from state to state  as will hiring and training expenses 
we believe that retaining good employees and more experienced staff ensures high quality guest service and may reduce hiring and training costs 
direct restaurant operating operating supplies  repairs and maintenance  utilities  promotions and restaurant level administrative expense represent the majority of our direct restaurant operating expense  a substantial portion of which is fixed or indirectly variable 
our direct restaurant operating expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to in from in decreases in costs of utilities  paper and plastic and uniforms were offset in part by increases in printing  repair and maintenance  and advertising costs as we continued the marketing initiatives we began in we continue to seek ways to reduce our direct operating costs going forward including additional pricing negotiations with suppliers and the elimination of waste 
occupancy our occupancy costs  which include both fixed and variable portions of rent  common area maintenance charges  property insurance and property taxes  increased as a percentage of revenue to in from in our occupancy cost increased significantly in the fourth quarter of as leases at nine of the restaurants we operate were converted from capital leases to operating leases as a result of lease amendments entered into in october as capital leases  a portion of the lease expense is recorded as interest expense and reduction of liability 
as operating leases  all lease expense is recorded as an occupancy cost included in rent expense 
during the second half of and early  lease amendments we entered into with the dunham landlords caused the classification of eight leases to change from operating leases to capital leases 
as a result  we expect our rent expense to decrease and our interest expense to increase 
also included in our rent expense is the difference between our current rent payments and straight line rent expense over the initial lease term 
this non cash rent expense of  and  is included in occupancy costs in and  respectively 
the  decrease in non cash rent expense was due primarily to the changes in terms pursuant to lease amendments 
pre opening pre opening costs  which are expensed as incurred  consist of expenses related to hiring and training the initial restaurant workforce  wages and expenses of a new restaurant opening team during periods of expansion  rental costs incurred during the construction period and certain other direct costs associated with opening new restaurants 
pre opening costs  excluding construction period rent  are primarily incurred in the month of  and two months prior to  restaurant opening 
in  our pre opening costs of  were related to the restaurant we opened in indianapolis  indiana in february we have not opened additional restaurants since that time  and therefore incurred no pre opening costs in general and administrative general and administrative expense includes all salaries and benefits  including non cash stock based compensation  associated with our corporate staff that is responsible for overall restaurant quality  any future expansion into new locations  financial controls and reporting  restaurant management recruiting  management training  excess capacity costs related to our beer production facility  and salaries and expenses of our new restaurant opening team when not dedicated to a 
table of contents particular restaurant opening 
other general and administrative expense includes advertising  professional fees  investor relations  office administration  centralized accounting system costs and travel by our corporate management 
general and administrative expense decreased  to  in from  in as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses decreased in compared to the primary sources of such decrease were expenses related to recruiting  consulting  compensation  travel and occupancy expense 
non cash stock based compensation included in general and administrative expense was  and  in and  respectively 
we continue to seek ways to reduce our general and administrative expenses through additional pricing negotiations with our vendors 
while we have started seeing the effects of previously renegotiated general and administrative costs  we will closely monitor and attempt to further reduce these expenses while seeking to preserve an infrastructure that remains suitable for our current operations 
although we may need to recruit additional personnel to provide continued oversight of operations  we expect our turnover ratios to return to levels more consistent with the industry  allowing us to better manage our employee costs 
to the extent our turnover increases above our expectations  additional costs above our budgeted figures could be incurred in our recruiting and training expenses 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased  to  in from  in  due principally to the reclassification of the leases at nine of the restaurants we operate from capital leases to operating leases in october however  with the reclassification of eight leases from operating to capital in late and early  we expect our depreciation expense will increase in as a percentage of revenue  depreciation expense decreased in compared to exit or disposal activities in august  we closed our rogers  arkansas restaurant 
since opening in october  the restaurant failed to generate positive cash flow and had approximately million of net loss 
we believe the closure of this restaurant has allowed management to focus capital and personnel resources on our other restaurants in order to increase future operating efficiencies and cash flow 
costs incurred in and in connection with this closure include costs to maintain the facility of approximately  and  respectively 
we recorded a non cash lease termination liability of  based on management estimate of the fair value of these obligations 
this required management to estimate the present value of the future minimum lease obligations offset by the estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the property 
amortization of this sublease liability was  and  in and  respectively 
all costs related to the closing of the rogers restaurant  including lease payments  are reflected in our statements of operations as exit or disposal activities 
in fiscal year  we entered into a lease termination agreement with the mall owner of this location which included a cash payment of  and a five year promissory note in the amount of  with annual interest of 
in a lease amendment agreement with dunham  the developer of the property  we are required to pay dunham  per year for years to offset property development costs 
pursuant to the lease termination agreement  we will incur no further costs associated with the property and will relinquish all equipment at the site 
as of the date of the lease termination agreement  our future undiscounted cash payments under the terms of this lease were approximately million 
as part of the master agreement we entered into with the dunham entities in february which was amended in january  we agreed to reimburse dcm for any out of pocket expenses incurred  reduced by net proceeds from the sale of the real estate or lease income associated with the rogers  arkansas site and the site at troy  michigan upon which we decided not to build a restaurant 

table of contents as december   the carrying cost of the land at the troy  michigan site approximated  per month and has been recorded in exit and disposal activities in our statement of operations 
reimbursement of costs related to these sites  including the carrying cost of the related land  generally will be amortized and payable to dcm over a month period commencing may   at a annual interest rate  however  in august  our board of directors agreed to reimburse dcm  of such expenses 
in february  we entered into an agreement with dcm to purchase the troy property  together with all plans  permits and related assets associated  for approximately million  subject to closing the cdp transaction 
if such transaction does not close  our management has concluded that as of december   it is probable that we will need to reimburse dcm approximately  and we have included such amount as accrued exit or disposal activities on our balance sheet 
interest net interest expense consists of interest expense on capital leases and long term debt  net of interest earned from cash on hand 
interest expense decreased  to  in from  in this decrease was due to capital lease reductions from our landlords and equipment financers and the extinguishment of approximately million of equipment lease debt through the issuance of common stock in october additionally  in october  leases at nine of the restaurants we operate were converted from capital leases to operating leases 
as a result  expense related to such leases that was recorded as interest expense in  was recorded as an occupancy cost included in rent in during the second half of and early  lease amendments we entered into with the dunham landlords caused the classification of eight leases to change from operating leases to capital leases 
as a result  we expect our interest expense to decrease and our rent expense to increase 
interest income increased  in over due to the increase in cash on hand 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had  of cash and a working capital deficit of  compared to  of cash and an  working capital deficit at december  during the year ended december   we obtained  net cash from operating activities 
we used  of net cash to purchase equipment and other assets  made payments aggregating  on our debt and capital lease obligations  paid deferred transaction costs of  and used  cash for cost related to the issuance of common stock 
during the year ended december   we obtained  net cash from operating activities and obtained proceeds of  pursuant to capital lease and debt agreements 
we used  of net cash to purchase equipment and other assets primarily related to our new restaurant and our beer production facility  made payments aggregating  on our debt and capital lease obligations and used  cash for costs related to the issuance of common stock to dhw in the debt conversion transaction 
proposed issuance of preferred stock and proposed repurchase of common stock on february   we entered into agreements with cdp and dhw for transactions  subject to obtaining shareholder approval  intended to improve our capital position and provide financing for future growth 
as a part of the transactions  we have entered into a stock purchase agreement with cdp for the sale of  shares of convertible preferred stock for million  each share of which will be convertible into two shares of our common stock  equivalent to a conversion price of per share 
the new preferred stock will carry a dividend rate of per annum through december   which will be paid in cash and in the form of newly issued common stock 
cdp will become our largest shareholder as a result of this transaction 
the sale of the preferred 
table of contents stock is subject to certain conditions  including a requirement that we obtain a million credit facility  we achieve additional rent reductions of at least  and cdp satisfactory completion of due diligence on its investment in our company 
the proceeds of such financing will be used to fund the repurchase of  shares of our common stock from dhw and to repay certain indebtedness 
we have also entered into a stock repurchase agreement with dhw  our current largest shareholder  to repurchase  shares of our outstanding common stock for million 
in addition  we have also entered into separate agreements with dcm  relating to the restructuring of existing leases to provide significant rent reductions and for options to purchase certain restaurant lease interests  and for the purchase of a certain parcel of developable property in troy  michigan at a cost of approximately million  where we have a previous obligation to offset any carrying costs and certain other costs borne by dcm 
our board of directors has called a special meeting  among other purposes  to ask our shareholders to consider and vote upon a proposal to approve the stock purchase agreement and proposed sale of preferred stock to cdp  which would result in a change in control of our company under applicable nasdaq listing rules and require shareholder approval and would result in the issuance of securities convertible into more than of our common stock outstanding prior to the issuance of the preferred stock at a price that may be less than the greater of book or market value of our common stock  which also requires shareholder approval under applicable nasdaq listing rules 
at the special meeting  we will also ask our shareholders to vote on the stock repurchase agreement and the related stock repurchase 
reverse stock split in december  our board of directors approved a one for six share combination of our common stock which became effective january  as a result of this reverse stock split  every six shares of our common stock that were issued and outstanding as of january   were automatically combined into one issued and outstanding share without any change in the par value of such shares  and the number of authorized but unissued shares of our common stock were proportionally reduced 
a proportionate adjustment was also made to our outstanding stock options and warrants 
no fractional shares were issued in connection with this reverse stock split 
shareholders who were entitled to fractional shares received cash in lieu of receiving fractional shares 
all references within this document to loss per share reflect this reverse stock split 
additionally  the number of common shares  stock options and warrants  and the price per common share  stock option and warrant  reflect this reverse stock split 
debt conversion transaction in october  we completed the debt conversion transaction with dhw  our primary source of financing for furniture  fixtures and equipment  as contemplated under the debt conversion agreement between our company and dhw dated september  in the debt conversion transaction  approximately million of our indebtedness to dhw was converted into  shares of our company common stock at a conversion price of approximately per share 
we obtained a waiver under the financial viability exception from nasdaq to its shareholder approval requirements  so the debt conversion transaction was not subject to approval by our shareholders 
the debt conversion transaction was approved  however  by a special committee of our company independent directors  by our board of directors  and by our audit committee under our company related person transaction policy 
as a result  dhw and affiliated parties came to beneficially own a majority of our company common stock  which constituted a change in control of our company 
because of this change in control  our use of federal net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income will be limited 
we recorded approximately million of issuance costs related to the debt conversion transaction 

table of contents in connection with the closing of the debt conversion transaction  the parties entered into a number of ancillary agreements 
amendment no 
to the master agreement  between the dunham entities and our company amends the master agreement entered into in february by such parties 
under the amendment  the parties agreed to provide the agreed upon rent reductions in and agreed to use reasonable commercial efforts to seek rent reductions on real estate leases of up to million in on leases for properties controlled by the dunham landlords and properties not controlled by the dunham landlords  compared to million under the original master agreement 
we intend to repurchase  of the shares we issued to dhw in october at a cost of million pursuant to the above described stock repurchase agreement with dhw  subject to shareholder approval of the agreement and the related transaction with cdp 
in connection with the debt conversion transaction  a master amendment to leases was entered into by and among our company and the dunham landlords

in connection with the debt conversion transaction we also entered into an amendment to the bridge loan agreement with harmony which deferred the october  interest payment  modified the minimum net consolidated revenue covenant for the quarters ending september  and december   and waived any participation rights in the debt conversion transaction 
we also entered into a registration rights agreement with dhw under which we granted dhw certain registration rights with respect to the shares that dhw received in the debt conversion transaction 
pursuant to the registration rights agreement  we agreed to file a registration statement with the sec covering  of dhw shares within days of the closing date  and agreed  upon request by dhw and if dhw has sold the shares previously registered  to file registration statements covering  additional shares each six months thereafter 
under the registration rights agreement  we are not obligated to file a more than six registration statements  b registration statements more frequently than every six months  or c any registration statement more than three years after the closing date 
the first of such resale registration statements became effective in february harmony bridge loan in march  we entered into a bridge loan agreement with harmony to provide million of partially convertible debt financing 
the chairman of our board of directors  eugene e

the transaction was approved by our audit 
table of contents committee as a transaction with a related person 
the bridge loan was funded to the extent of  on march   with the balance of the bridge loan originally to be funded by april  the closing date on the remainder of the amount committed was extended by reason of successive amendments through december  an amendment dated december   provided  among other things  that the amount to be loaned under the bridge loan agreement would be decreased to  from million 
the bridge loan is evidenced by notes bearing interest at per annum  payable pursuant to the amendment as follows a the principal amount outstanding under the loans shall be payable as follows i six installments of  each shall be payable on january   and on the first day of each month thereafter including june   ii the remaining principal amount outstanding shall be payable in equal monthly installments commencing on january  and on the first day of each month thereafter  with the final installment of any unpaid principal due on december  b interest accrued shall be treated as follows i accrued and unpaid interest shall be added to the principal amount outstanding under the loans on july   october  and january   ii accrued interest shall be payable quarterly in arrears on april   july   october  and january   and iii accrued interest shall be payable monthly in arrears commencing on february  and on the first day of each month thereafter  with a final payment of any accrued and unpaid interest due on december  with the final payment of principal 
the notes are secured by a mortgage against the lease  and security agreements against personal property and intangibles  relating to the our sioux falls  south dakota restaurant  including a grant of the rights to use patents  trademarks and other intangibles associated with that restaurant 
the notes may be prepaid upon days prior notice without premium or penalty 
the notes must also be paid if we receive million or more of proceeds from the sale of equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities 
the notes must also be repaid in the event we default under the terms and conditions of the bridge loan  including the financial covenants set forth therein 
such covenants include maintaining minimum operating income before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization from the sioux falls  south dakota restaurant operations  and minimum consolidated revenue of our company  as provided in the bridge loan agreement 
up to of each bridge note may be converted into common stock at a conversion price equal to per share 
in addition  we issued to harmony warrants for the purchase of an aggregate of  shares of common stock exercisable six months after date of issuance at a price of per share  or of the closing price of our stock on march  the notes and the warrants provide customary anti dilution rights to the holders  including weighted average anti dilution provisions for sales at less than the exercise or conversion prices thereof 
we have also agreed that if we propose to issue new securities in excess of of our outstanding shares prior to may   subject to the exceptions noted below  we will give the investors the right to purchase up to that portion of the new securities which equals the proportion of the number of securities purchasable upon conversion of notes and exercise of the warrants relative to our outstanding stock as of march  the participation right is not applicable to certain categories of issuances  such as shares issuable pursuant to public offerings  mergers and acquisitions  and options  warrants and other rights to purchase securities 
we have also granted the investors certain rights to require us to file a registration statement with the sec covering the common stock acquired by them upon conversion of the notes or exercise of the warrants  or include such shares in certain company registrations  at our expense 
we may repay all or part of this indebtedness using proceeds from the above described stock purchase agreement with cdp  subject to shareholder approval of the stock purchase agreement and the related stock issuance 

table of contents rent reduction agreements in february  we entered into a master agreement with the dunham entities to provide rent or other cash flow reductions to our company the master agreement 
the master agreement  which was amended as part of the debt conversion transaction  provided for such reductions in the amount of million for the calendar year and million for calendar year the master agreement provided that the dunham entities would amend and restate applicable leases and subleases to reflect negotiated rent reductions 
we commenced paying reduced rent in january in anticipation of finalizing the master agreement  which reductions are deemed to be part of the negotiated rent reductions 
in consideration of the agreements of the dunham entities provided in the master agreement  we issued to the dunham entities a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  representing of the closing price of our common stock on the trading date prior to the date of signing the master agreement 
the value of these warrants of  is being amortized over a ten year period  which was the term of the majority of the underlying amended lease agreements see liquidity and capital resources debt conversion transaction 
subsequently  we entered into agreements with certain of our other landlords for rent reductions 
such rent reductions are deemed to be part of the above referenced million in aggregate rent reductions sought for and in consideration of such rent reductions  we have issued five year warrants to purchase our common stock to such landlords 
at the time of issuance  the aggregate number of shares underlying such warrants was  and the weighted average exercise price was per share 
the value of these warrants of  is being amortized over the underlying lease terms 
funding operations and expansion during the fiscal year ended december   we operated at a level that allowed us to fund our existing operations 
we believe this same level of sales and margins will allow us to fund our obligations for the foreseeable future 
however  our ability to continue funding our operations and meet our debt service obligations continues to depend upon our operating performance  and more broadly  achieving budgeted revenue and operating margins  both of which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the retail and casual dining industries and other factors  which may be beyond our control 
if revenue or margins  or a combination of both  decrease to levels unsustainable for continuing operations  we will require equity or debt financing to meet ongoing obligations 
the amount of any such required funding would depend upon our ability to generate working capital 
furthermore  we also believe that we will need to begin increasing the number of units we operate to lessen turnover costs as managers and other key personnel may otherwise seek new opportunities with growing restaurant chains 
in anticipation of completing the transaction with cdp  which remains subject to approval by our shareholders  we are evaluating strategies for growth under the assumptions that we will continue to generate positive cash flow from existing operations and that we will have access to a million credit facility  which is a condition to closing the cdp transaction 
under these assumptions  we are looking at a variety of alternatives both to generate new revenue and to invest in technologies to improve our existing business and financial condition 
we expect to generate additional revenue through new store growth within our existing geographic footprint 
we are analyzing potential new restaurant sites and expectations of revenue growth 
we will also seek to generate additional revenue by enhancing our existing store operations through  for example  the addition of private dining rooms for events and regular dining and increasing the square footage of bar areas 
we are evaluating the costs of these potential capital enhancements relative to the projected revenue gains to determine expected return on investment of these potential store modifications 

table of contents we also believe that in pursuing strategies contemplated following completion of the transaction with cdp  we would be able to operate existing and future stores more efficiently through technological improvements in our table management and kitchen operations 
the goal of these improvements would be to increase table turnover  provide a higher level of service to our customers  improve overall dining experience  increase our sales  and improve our financial condition 
the above objectives assume that we continue to generate positive cash flow and that we have available a million credit facility upon closing the cdp transaction 
if we cease generating positive cash flow or the expected credit facility is not available to us  our business could be adversely affected and we may be required to alter or cease our plans for new stores  store modifications and technological improvements 
because our available sources of liquidity are currently insufficient to fund expansion  we would need to raise additional capital through sales of equity securities or debt to fund growth  if we are unable to complete the cdp transaction 
if we are able to complete the cdp transaction and obtain a million credit facility  we expect to commence a program to enhance existing restaurants to increase their revenue potential and develop at least one new restaurant within months following the closing of the cdp transaction 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete the cdp transaction or obtain future financing on favorable terms or at all 
if we raise additional capital in the future through the issuance and sale of equity securities  the securities may be issued at prices below the market price of our stock  and our shareholders may suffer significant dilution 
future debt financing  if available  may involve significant cash payment obligations  covenants and financial ratios that restrict our ability to operate and grow our business  and would cause us to incur additional interest expense and financing costs 
the failure to obtain financing for future growth could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
further  if future debt financing does become available  we may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates will also affect our lease rates and can be expected to adversely impact our operating results 
commitments capital leases property leases as of december   we operated restaurants under capital lease agreements  of which one expires in  three in  five in  two in  three in and seven in  all with renewable options for additional periods 
nineteen of these lease agreements originated with the dunham landlords 
under certain of the leases  we may be required to pay additional contingent rent based upon restaurant sales 
at the inception and the amendment date of each of these leases  we evaluated the fair value of the land and building separately pursuant to the fasb guidance on accounting for leases 
the land portion of these leases is classified as an operating lease while the building portion of these leases is classified as a capital lease because its present value was greater than of the estimated fair value at the beginning or amendment date of the lease and or the lease term represents or more of the expected life of the property 
during the second half of fiscal year  we entered into amendments to of our leases with the dunham landlords  changing the rental amount and extending the term of each lease 
the amended terms caused the classification of six such leases to change from operating leases to capital leases included above and five such leases were  and continue to be  capital leases 
as a result of these amendments  we recorded additional assets and capital lease liabilities of approximately million in the aggregate 
such assets and liabilities were each reduced by a write off of approximately million of deferred gain related to these properties 

table of contents in fiscal year  we entered into amendments to two additional leases 
the amended terms of the lease caused the classification of each to change from operating leases to capital leases 
as a result of these amendments  we will record additional assets and liabilities of approximately million in the aggregate 
additionally  we are in negotiation to purchase the property improvements at two locations 
in december  we entered into a land and building lease agreement for our beer production facility 
this ten year lease  which commenced february   allows us to purchase the facility at any time for plus the unamortized construction costs 
because the construction costs will be fully amortized through payment of rent during the base term  if the option is exercised at or after the end of the initial ten year period  the option price will be 
as such  the lease is classified as a capital lease 
in may  we entered into a year net lease agreement relating to the restaurant we planned to open in troy  michigan 
however  in february  we decided not to build on that site  and as part of an agreement with the dunham entities  we will reimburse dcm for any out of pocket expenses incurred less net proceeds from the sale of the real estate or lease income associated with the site 
subject to closing the cdp transaction  we have agreed to purchase the troy property  together with all plans  permits and related assets associated  from dcm for approximately million 
equipment leases in august  we entered into a master lease agreement with carlton financial corporation carlton pursuant to which we could finance lease up to million of equipment purchases for three restaurant locations 
subsequently  we entered into three lease schedules and amendments to this master lease  pursuant to which we began leasing equipment for an initial lease term ranging from to months 
the value of the equipment financed at each of the three locations ranges from approximately million to million and the annual interest rate on each ranges from to annually 
in february and again in august  we entered into amendments to the three lease schedules of our master lease agreement with carlton consolidating the three schedules into one  reducing the monthly payments and extending the terms of the lease schedules by approximately two years 
pursuant to the amendments  we may purchase carlton interest in all  but not less than all  of the equipment for a purchase price equal to of the original cost of the equipment 
steven j 
wagenheim  our president  chief executive officer and one of our directors  was required to personally guarantee payments to be made to carlton under the lease financing and our board of directors agreed to compensate him for such guarantee 
in june  we entered into a lease for an energy optimization system at our maple grove  minnesota restaurant for approximately  this five year lease commenced june   carries an annual interest rate of approximately and contains a bargain purchase option

under the terms of the agreement  each five year lease with dhw was for equipment costing approximately million per restaurant and the annual interest rate on each lease ranged from to 
payments due dhw had an annual interest rate equal to the dhw bank base rate plus 
as part of the debt conversion transaction entered into in october  the aggregate balance remaining of approximately million was extinguished through the issuance of  shares of our common stock 
operating lease the land portions of the property leases referenced above  lease agreements of which originated with the dunham landlords  are classified as operating leases because the fair value of the 
table of contents land was or more of the leased property at the inception of each lease 
all scheduled rent increases for the land during the initial term of each lease are recognized on a straight line basis 
in addition to such property leases  we have obligations under the following operating leases we operate three restaurants under operating lease agreements with the dunham landlords 
each lease expires in and has renewable options for additional periods 
scheduled rent increases during the initial term are recognized on a straight line basis 
in fiscal year  we entered into amendment to two of these leases with terms that will cause them to be classified as capital leases 
pursuant to the amendments  one such lease will expire in and the other will expire in in january  we entered into a year operating lease for the land upon which we built our fargo  north dakota restaurant 
under the lease terms  we are obligated to annual rent of  plus contingent rent based upon restaurant sales 
in august  we entered into a month lease agreement for office space for our corporate offices 
the lease commenced october  in november and again in december  we entered into amendments to such lease to include additional space and rent reduction 
pursuant to the amended lease  which expires in november  annual rent is  scheduled rent increases have been recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease

personal guaranties our board of directors has agreed to compensate steven j 
wagenheim  our president  chief executive officer and one of our directors  for his personal guaranties of equipment loans entered into in august and january in addition  in august  we entered into a lease agreement with carlton pursuant to which we financed approximately million of equipment 
mr 
wagenheim was required to personally guarantee payments to be made to carlton under this lease financing agreement  for which our board of directors agreed to compensate him 
the amount of annual compensation for each of these guarantees is of the balance of the obligation and is calculated and accrued based on the weighted average daily balance of the obligation at the end of each monthly accounting period 
during fiscal years and  we recorded  and  of such compensation in general and administrative expense  respectively  and paid  and  of such compensation  respectively 
employment agreements we have entered into employment agreements with steven j 
wagenheim  our president and chief executive officer  james g 
gilbertson  our chief financial officer  and darius h 
gilanfar  our chief operating officer  providing for their employment on an at will basis 
each agreement  as amended in october  provides that the executive will have employment for a term of one year following the closing of the debt conversion transaction  and will be entitled to severance benefits that include one year of base compensation if his employment is terminated without cause or for good reason  as defined therein  in addition to the balance of the one year term  if terminated prior to the end of such term 
each employment agreement is automatically extended for a one year term unless either our 
table of contents company or the executive gives at least days notice to the other of an intent not to extend 
the agreements also provide for a base annual salary which may be increased by our board of directors  incentive compensation as determined by our compensation committee from time to time  and participation in our company other employee benefit plans

each executive has also agreed to certain nondisclosure provisions during the term of his employment and any time thereafter  and certain non competition  non recruitment and or non interference provisions during the term of his employment and for a certain period thereafter 
as of february   the current annual base salaries in effect for such executives under the foregoing employment agreements were as follows mr 
wagenheim  mr 
gilbertson  and mr

development agreement in april  we entered into a development agreement with united properties for the development of up to restaurants to be built between and united properties will be responsible for all costs related to the land and building of each restaurant 
the development agreement provides for a cooperative process between united properties and our management for the selection of restaurant sites and the development of restaurants on those sites and scheduling for the development and construction of each restaurant once a location is approved 
the annual lease rate for fee simple land and building developments will be and we will have the right of first offer to purchase these restaurants 
additionally  in the event united properties sells one of the buildings that it develops for us at an amount in excess of the threshold agreed to by the parties in the agreement  then we will share in the profits of that sale 
we assume no liability in the event united properties sells a building at a loss 
we are not bound to authorize the construction of restaurants during that time period  but generally cannot use another developer to develop or own a restaurant as long as the development agreement is in effect 
we can  however  use another developer if united properties declines to build a particular restaurant 
we currently have no sites under development  but we are beginning to review potential locations in anticipation of closing the cdp transaction 
off balance sheet arrangements it is not our business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements 
summary of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our obligations under contractual agreements and the timeframe within which payments on such obligations are due 
this table includes all lease amendments and long term debt agreements executed subsequent to december  this table does not include amounts related to contingent rent as such future amounts are not determinable 
in addition  whether we would incur any additional expense on our employment agreements depends upon the existence of a change in control of the company coupled with a termination of employment or other unforeseeable 
table of contents events 
therefore  neither contingent rent nor severance expense has been included in the following table 
payment due by period contractual obligations total fiscal year fiscal years fiscal years fiscal years thereafter long term debt  principal interest on long term debt capital lease obligations  including interest operating lease obligations  including interest purchase contracts loan guarantee total obligations while we are contractually obligated to make these purchases  we have the contractual right to defer such purchases into later years 
however  if we defer such purchases into later years  we may incur additional charges 
certain amounts do not sum due to rounding 
during the fiscal year ended december   we operated at a level that allowed us to fund our existing operations 
we believe this same level of sales and margins will allow us to fund our obligations for the foreseeable future 
in connection with the above described stock purchase agreement with cdp  we expect to be able to lower our occupancy cost and increase our number of restaurants 
if such transaction is not completed  we would need to obtain equity or debt financing from another source to fund this growth 
we continue to review our capital needs and our ability to raise additional capital 
if  however  we experience a change in our business operations or further declining revenues  we may require further funding for operations during seasonality we expect that our sales and earnings will fluctuate based on seasonal patterns 
we anticipate that our highest sales and earnings will occur in the second and third quarters due to the milder climate and availability of outdoor seating during those quarters in our markets 
inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food  supplies and labor costs 
a large percentage of our restaurant personnel is paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage directly affect our labor costs 
in the past  we have been able to minimize the effect of these increases through menu price increases and other strategies 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on our operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and changes in commodity prices 

table of contents changes in interest rate pursuant to the terms of our long term debt agreement with an independent financial institution  we will have a balloon payment due of approximately million in if it becomes necessary to refinance such balloon balance  we may not be able to secure financing at the same interest rate 
the effect of a higher interest rate would depend upon the negotiated financing terms 
changes in commodity prices many of the food products and other commodities we use in our operations are subject to price volatility due to market supply and demand factors outside of our control 
fluctuations in commodity prices and or long term changes could have an adverse effect on us 
these commodities are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
to manage this risk in part  we have entered into fixed price purchase commitments  with terms typically up to one year  for many of our commodity requirements 
we have entered into contracts through with certain suppliers of raw materials primarily hops for minimum purchases both in terms of quantity and pricing 
as of december   our future obligations under such contracts aggregated approximately million 
although a large national distributor is our primary supplier of food  substantially all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to control commodity price risks 
additionally  we have the ability to increase menu prices  or vary the menu items offered  in response to food product price increases 
if  however  competitive circumstances limit our menu price flexibility  our margins could be negatively impacted 
our company does not enter into derivative contracts either to hedge existing risks or for speculative purposes
