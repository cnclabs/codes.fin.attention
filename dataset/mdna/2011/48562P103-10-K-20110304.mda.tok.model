critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
kapstone believes our critical accounting policies are those described below 
for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership 
sales with terms designated fob free on board shipping point are recognized at the time of shipment 
for sales transactions with terms fob destination  revenue is recorded when the product is delivered to the customer site and when title and risk of loss are transferred 
sales on consignment are recognized in revenue at the earlier of the month that the goods are consumed or after a period of time subsequent to receipt by the customer as specified by contract terms 
incentive rebates are typically paid in cash and are netted against revenue on an accrual basis as qualifying purchases are made by the customer to earn and thereby retain the rebate 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of shaft horsepower  generated by its cogeneration facility  on a gross basis and within net sales 
these sales are included in the unbleached kraft segment 
freight charged to customers is recognized in net sales 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired 
on an annual basis and in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other  the company tests for goodwill impairment using a two step process  unless there is a triggering event  in which case a test would be performed at the time that such triggering event occurs 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
for all periods presented  the company reporting units are consistent with its operating segments 
the estimates of fair value of a reporting unit are determined based on a market approach as well as an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis 
a discounted cash flow analysis requires the company to make various judgmental assumptions  including assumptions about future cash flows  growth rates and discount rates 
the assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on the forecast and long term business plans of the company operating segment 

table of contents discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units 
if necessary  the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
pension and postretirement benefits kapstone provides pension and postretirement benefits to certain employees and accounts for these benefits in accordance with asc  compensation retirement benefits 
for financial reporting purposes  long term assumptions are developed through consultations with actuaries 
such assumptions include the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  discount rates  health care trend rates and mortality rates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the sensitivity of income to changes in interest rates  commodity prices and foreign currency changes 
the company is exposed to the following types of market risk interest rates  commodity prices and foreign currency 
interest rates under kapstone senior secured credit facility  at december   we had outstanding variable based interest rate term loans totaling million 
the facility has two maturity dates  june  for term a and june  for term b 
borrowings under the term loan accrue interest  at our option  at either eurodollar plus percent to percent depending on kapstone total debt to ebitda ratio as defined in the agreement  or the base rate prime rate plus zero percent to percent depending on kapstone total debt to ebitda ratio 
changes in market rates may impact the bank eurodollar rate 
for instance  if the bank eurodollar rates were to increase or decrease by one percentage point  our annual interest expense would change by approximately million based upon our expected future monthly loan balances per our existing repayment schedule 
commodity prices we are exposed to price fluctuations of certain commodities used in production 
key raw materials and energy used in the production process include roundwood and woodchips  fuel oil  electricity and

we purchase these raw materials and energy at market prices  and do not use forward contracts or other financial instruments to hedge our exposure to price risk related to these commodities 
we have two contracts to purchase coal at fixed prices with one expiring on december  and the other on december  we are exposed to price fluctuations in the price of our finished goods 
the prices we charge for our products are primarily based on market conditions

the company used foreign currency forward contracts and foreign exchange forward contracts to manage some of the foreign currency exchange risks associated with foreign sales of its us operations during using such foreign currency forward contracts  the company received or paid the difference between the contracted forward rate and the exchange rate at the settlement date 
these contracts were used to hedge the variability of exchange rates on the company cash flows 
no such contracts were outstanding at december  and
