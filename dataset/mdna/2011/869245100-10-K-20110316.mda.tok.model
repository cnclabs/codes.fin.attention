item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a community bank primarily operating in sussex county  new jersey and orange county  new york that provides diversified financial services to both consumer and business customers 
our primary source of revenues  approximately  is derived from net interest income which represents the difference between the interest the company earns on its assets  principally loans and investment securities  and interest it pays on its deposits and borrowings 
when expressed as a percentage of average interest earning assets  it is referred to as net interest margin margin 
we augment our primary revenue source through non interest income sources that include insurance commissions from our wholly owned subsidiary  tri state insurance agency  service charges on deposits  bank owned life insurance boli income and commissions on mutual funds and annuities 
in addition  we from time to time may recognize income on gains on sales of securities  however  we do not consider this a primary source of income as we no longer have a securities trading portfolio 
over the last two years  the financial services sector has been significantly impacted by the effects of a weakened united states economy and deterioration in real estate market values 
real estate is typically the main form of collateral for community bank lending 
we have has also been affected by the weakened economy and the deterioration in the real estate market which is reflected in the credit quality of our loan portfolio 
we have also experienced a significant increase in credit related costs over the last two years 
for  we made considerable changes in executive and senior management and continue to make strides in controlling and mitigating our credit quality issues 
for  our credit quality metrics have shown some signs of stabilizing  however  we remain cautiously optimistic for continued improving trends 
despite the level of non performing assets and the increased credit quality costs  we reported an increase in earnings from last year with a return on average assets of and earnings of million  which is just below our historical high of million in our net income available to shareholders increased to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  over the same period in we attributed the increase in net income to a increase in net interest income  which was largely due to a stronger net interest margin 
highlights net interest income tax equivalent basis increased million to million in net interest margin tax equivalent basis was for  up from in the improvement was due to a decline in funding costs for provision for loan losses decreased thousand  or  for as compared to the same period last year 
non interest income decreased thousand  or  to million for the decrease was driven by declines in gain on the sales of securities  fixed assets and foreclosed real estate in  which were lower in total by thousand for as compared to in addition  the company recorded an other than temporary impairment charge on equity securities during the second quarter in of thousand and insurance commissions were lower by thousand for due in part to market softness 
non interest expense increased thousand to million for the increase was largely attributed to higher employee related costs resulting from an increase in salary expense of and a increase in benefits costs 
credit quality shows signs of stabilizing o nonperforming assets as a percent of total assets was and at december  and  respectively 
o nonperforming assets decreased by thousand  or  to million at december  o net charge offs for declined million to million for o the allowance for loan losses totaled million at december   or of total loans  as compared to million  or of total loans  at december  return on average assets of for and for capital adequacy at december  the leverage  tier i and total risk based capital ratios for sussex bank were  and  respectively  all in excess of the ratios required to be deemed well capitalized 

index the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained elsewhere in this report 
management strategy our goal is to serve as a community oriented financial institution serving northern new jersey  northeastern pennsylvania and the orange county  new york marketplace 
while offering traditional community bank loan and deposit products and services  we obtain significant non interest income through tri state s insurance brokerage operations and the sale of non deposit products 
we report the operations of tri state as a separate segment from our commercial banking operations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding our two segments 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
since future events and their effect cannot be determined with absolute certainty  actual results may differ from those estimates 
management makes adjustments to its assumptions and judgments when facts and circumstances dictate 
the amounts currently estimated by us are subject to change if different assumptions as to the outcome of future events were made 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management believes the following critical accounting policies encompass the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses charged to operating expense reflects the amount deemed appropriate by management to provide for known and inherent losses in the existing loan portfolio 
management s judgment is based on the evaluation of the past experience of individual loans  the assessment of current economic conditions  and other relevant factors 
loan losses are charged directly against the allowance for loan losses and recoveries on previously charged off loans are added to the allowance 
management uses significant estimates to determine the allowance for loan losses 
consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing these estimates including current economic conditions  diversification of the loan portfolio  delinquency statistics  borrowers perceived financial and managerial strengths  the adequacy of underlying collateral  if collateral dependent  or present value of future cash flows  and other relevant factors 
since the sufficiency of the allowance for loan losses is dependent to a great extent on conditions that may be beyond our control  it is possible that management s estimates of the allowance for loan losses and actual results could differ in the near term 
although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future additions to the allowance may be necessary if certain future events occur that cause actual results to differ from the assumptions used in making the evaluation 
for example  a downturn in the local economy could cause increases in non performing loans 
additionally  a decline in real estate values could cause some of our loans to become inadequately collateralized 
in either case  this may require us to increase our provisions for loan losses  which would negatively impact earnings 
additionally  a large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance  which would negatively impact earnings 
finally  regulatory authorities  as an integral part of their examination  periodically review the allowance for loan losses 
they may require additions to the allowance for loan losses based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of examination 
future increases to our allowance for loan losses  whether due to unexpected changes in economic conditions or otherwise  could adversely affect our future results of operations 
appraisal policy 
we have a detailed policy covering the real estate appraisal process  including the selection of qualified appraisers  review of appraisal reports upon receipt  and complying with the federal regulatory standards that govern the minimum requirements for obtaining appraisals or evaluations 
appraisals and evaluations are considered to be current when the valuation date is within months of a new loan or months of any renewal of an existing loan 
the appraisal is not considered to be current if there has been a substantial change in value  demand  supply or competitive factors 
the following types of transactions require a real estate appraisal non residential transactions when the transaction value exceeds 
index loan transactions in which real estate is used as the primary security for the loan  regardless of the type of loan commercial  installment or mortgage  including new loans  loan modifications  loan extensions and renewals  provided that certain conditions are met 
the purchase  sale  exchange or investment in real property or an interest in real property where the transaction value of the real property interest exceeds  the long term lease of real estate  which is the economic equivalent of a purchase or sale where the transaction value of the real property interest exceeds  purchase of a loan or pool of loans  or participation therein  or of an interest in real property  providing that any individual loan or property interest exceeds  and further provided that a satisfactory appraisal of the property relating to that loan or interest has not been made available to the bank by another party to the transaction 
the need for real estate appraisals applies to initial loan underwriting and subsequently when the value of the real estate collateral might be materially affected by changing market conditions  changes in the occupancy of the property  changes in cash flow generated by the property  changes in the physical conditions of the property or other factors 
these factors include changes in the sales prices of comparable properties  absorption rates  capitalization rates  effective rental rates and current construction costs 
real estate appraisals are not required for the following transactions new loans  loan modifications  loan extensions and renewals with real property interest value of  or less 
purchase  sale  exchange  long term lease or investment in real property where the transaction value of the real property interest does not exceed  renewal or extension of an existing loan in excess of  provided that certain conditions are met 
purchase of a loan or pool of loans  or participation therein  or of an interest in real property where a satisfactory appraisal of the property relating to that loan or interest has been made available to the bank by another federally insured depository institution that is subject to title xi of financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of firrea 
while real estate appraisals are not required for transactions of  or less  we will consider obtaining one if the orderly liquidation of the collateral is the primary source of repayment 
to the extent that an appraisal is not required for a real estate collateralized transaction  we will obtain for its credit files another acceptable form of valuation  ie equalized value with a reasonable market relevance or evaluation 
additionally  real estate appraisals are not required on transactions over  when taking a lien on real property as collateral solely through an abundance of caution  and where the terms of the transaction as a consequence have not been made more favorable than would have been in the absence of the mortgage lien 
in determining whether an appraisal can be waived due to this reason  approval must be obtained from our chief credit officer 
generally  we obtain updated appraisals for real estate loan renewals and modifications or certain classified loans depending on the age of the last appraisal  volatility of the local market  and other factors 
in certain circumstances  if we can support an appraisal that is greater than one year old with an evaluation  utilizing current information such as current comparable sales  independent appraisal consultant data and or tax assessment values  etc  then it may continue to use the existing appraisal 
in developing an evaluation  we may use an index multiplier  provided by our independent appraisal consultant  to adjust the value of an existing outdated appraisal 
the index multiplier uses factors derived from its observation of market trends  including declines in real estate values and increases in marketing time as determined from its inventory of appraisals  appraisal reviews  as well as conversations with local appraisers and real estate brokers 
for classified criticized loans  when it is determined that a deficiency exists utilizing the above evaluation methods  a new appraisal will be ordered 
in determining our allowance for loan losses for classified loans where appraisals are required for valuation  we may make one time or periodic adjustments by utilizing an index multiplier as discussed above as an adjustment to the appraisal value based on its age 

index stock compensation plans 
we currently have several stock plans in place for our employees and directors 
we account for stock based compensation under the accounting guidance of fasb asc  compensation stock compensation  which requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements 
the stock compensation accounting guidance requires that compensation cost for all stock awards be calculated and recognized over predefined vesting periods 
income taxes 
management considers accounting for income taxes as a critical accounting policy due to the subjective nature of certain estimates that are involved in the calculation and evaluation of the timing and recognition of resulting tax assets and liabilities 
management uses the asset liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
deferred tax expense is the result of changes between deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the principal types of differences between assets and liabilities for financial statement and tax return purposes are allowance for loan losses  deferred compensation and securities available for sale 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we have recorded goodwill of million at december  primarily related to the acquisition of tri state in october of fasb asc  intangibles goodwill and others  requires that goodwill is not amortized to expense  but rather that it be tested for impairment at least annually 
we periodically assess whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of goodwill require additional impairment testing 
we perform our annual impairment test on the goodwill of tri state in the fourth quarter of each calendar year 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the book value  no write downs of goodwill are necessary 
if the fair value is less than the book value  an additional test is necessary to assess the proper carrying value of goodwill 
we determined that no impairment write offs were necessary during and business unit valuation is inherently subjective  with a number of factors based on assumptions and management judgments 
among these are future growth rates  discount rates and earnings capitalization rates 
changes in assumptions and results due to economic conditions  industry factors and reporting unit performance could result in different assessments of the fair value and could result in impairment charges in the future 
investment securities impairment evaluation 
management evaluates securities for other than temporary impairment on at least a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation 
consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and if we do not intend to sell the security  and it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis  we will recognize the credit component of an other than temporary impairment of the security in earnings and the remaining portion in other comprehensive income 
for held to maturity securities  the amount of an other than temporary impairment recorded in other comprehensive income for the noncredit portion of a previous other then temporary impairment should be amortized prospectively over the remaining life of the security on the basis of the timing of future estimated cash flows of the security 
no held to maturity securities at december  were deemed to be impaired and we did not have any held for maturity securities in we did recognize an other than temporary impairment charge in of thousand on certain available for sale equity securities and did not have an other than temporary impairment in during the second quarter of  we recognized a thousand pre tax thousand after tax  or per share non cash other than temporary impairment charge related to an equity portfolio fund that had an amortized cost of thousand and a termination date of october  the impairment was recognized because the market value of this security was below our amortized cost for an extended period of time along with credit deterioration in some of the underlying collateral and it was not believed the market value of this security would recover to our amortized cost before its termination in october the fund was comprised of common stocks of bank holding companies 
management executed a redemption in kind provision for this investment prior to its termination date 
we received our pro rata share of the underlying equity securities totaling thousand 
the securities were recorded at market value resulting in an additional thousand pre tax charge related to the exchange 

index comparison of financial condition at year end december  and at december   we had total assets of million compared to total assets of million at december   an increase of million  or 
net loans increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  total deposits increased to million at december  from million at december  cash and cash equivalents 
our cash and cash equivalents decreased million  or  at december  to million from million at december  this decrease was due to the company investing excess liquidity into securities 
trading securities and securities portfolio 
our securities portfolio is designed to provide interest income  including tax exempt income  and also provide a source of liquidity  diversify the earning assets portfolio  allow for management of interest rate risk  and provide collateral for public fund deposits and borrowings 
securities are classified as either trading  available for sale or held to maturity 
the portfolio is composed primarily of obligations of us government agencies and government sponsored entities  including collateralized mortgage obligations issued by such agencies and entities  and tax exempt municipal bonds 
we periodically conduct reviews to evaluate whether unrealized losses on our investment securities portfolio are deemed temporarily impaired or whether an other than temporary impairment has occurred 
various inputs to economic models are used to determine if an unrealized loss is other than temporary 
all of our debt and equity securities have been evaluated as of december  and we do not consider any security other than temporarily impaired 
we evaluated the prospects of the issuers in relation to the severity and the duration of the unrealized losses 
our securities in unrealized loss positions are mostly driven by wider credit spreads and changes in interest rates 
based on that evaluation we do not intend to sell any security in an unrealized loss position  and it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell any of our securities before recovery of its cost basis 
our available for sale securities are stated at fair value while securities held to maturity are stated at cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts 
trading securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value included in earnings 
unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are excluded from results of operations  and are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity net of taxes 
securities classified as available for sale include securities that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates  changes in prepayment risk  the need to increase regulatory capital or other similar requirements 
management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase

the decline in foreclosed real estate was attributed to the sale of our largest foreclosed asset during the third quarter of the decrease was mostly offset by increases in construction and residential non performing loans 
the largest increase in non performing assets was a million increase in non accrual construction loans  which was principally one lending relationship 
our collateral for that lending relationship was comprised of real estate  including completed residential homes  vacant lots and a commercial building 
residential real estate non accrual loans increased thousand to million at year end and were comprised of loans with an average balance of thousand 
we continue to make progress in managing through our asset quality situation despite the current economic environment and high levels of unemployment  which continues to adversely impact our loan portfolio credit quality 
the ratio of non performing assets to total assets decreased to at december  from one year earlier 
management continues to monitor our asset quality and believes that the non accrual loans are adequately collateralized and anticipated material losses have been adequately reserved for in the allowance for loan losses

potential problem loans are defined as loans in which causes management to have serious concerns as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which may cause the loan to be placed on non accrual status 
as of december   the company had loans totaling million that it deemed potential problem loans 
management is actively monitoring these loans 
future increases in the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on the growth of the loan portfolio  the change in composition of the loan portfolio  possible future increases in non performing loans and charge offs  and the impact the deterioration of the real estate and economic environments in our lending region 
although we use the best information available  the level of allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short term change 
see critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance consists of general and allocated components 
the allocated component relates to loans that are classified as impaired 
for those loans that are classified as impaired  an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows  collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan 
the general component covers non classified loans and is based on historical charge off experience and expected losses derived from our internal risk rating process 
other adjustments may be made to the allowance for pools of loans after an assessment of internal or external influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss or risk rating data 
management regularly assesses the appropriateness and adequacy of the loan loss reserve in relation to credit exposure associated with individual borrowers  overall trends in the loan portfolio and other relevant factors  and believes the reserve is reasonable and adequate for each of the periods presented 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  an increase of thousand  or  from million at december  the provision for loan losses was million and there were million in charge offs and thousand in recoveries during the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was at december  compared to on december

index equity 
stockholders equity inclusive of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of income taxes  was million at december   an increase of million from the million at year end stockholders equity increased due to million in net income recorded in comparison of operating results at year end december  and results of operations 
our net income is impacted by five major components and each of them are reviewed in more detail in the following discussion net interest income  or the difference between interest income earned on loans and investments and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds  provision for loan losses  or the amount added to the allowance for loan losses to provide reserves for inherent losses on loans  non interest income  which is made up primarily of certain loan and deposit fees  insurance commissions and gains and losses from sales of securities or other transactions  non interest expense  which consists primarily of salaries  employee benefits  credit collection and write off costs and other operating expenses  and income taxes 
our net income available to shareholders increased to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  over the same period in we attributed the increase in net income to a increase in net interest income  which was largely due to a stronger net interest margin 
net interest income 
net interest income is the most significant component of the company s income from operations 
net interest income is the difference between interest earned on total interest earning assets primarily loans and investment securities  on a fully taxable equivalent basis  where appropriate  and interest paid on total interest bearing liabilities primarily deposits and borrowed funds 
fully taxable equivalent basis represents income on total interest earning assets that is either tax exempt or taxed at a reduced rate  adjusted to give effect to the prevailing incremental federal tax rate  and adjusted for nondeductible carrying costs and state income taxes  where applicable 
yield calculations  where appropriate  include these adjustments 
net interest income depends on the volume and interest rate earned on interest earning assets and the volume and interest rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 

index comparative average balance and average interest rates 
the following table presents  on a fully taxable equivalent basis  a summary of our interest earning assets and their average yields  and interest bearing liabilities and their average costs for each of the years ended december  and the average balances of loans include non accrual loans  and associated yields include loan fees  which are considered adjustment to yields

in addition  total average earning assets increased by million to million from million for the year ended december  interest income 
total interest income  on a fully taxable equivalent basis  decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decline in interest income was largely due to decreases in average rates earned on total earning assets  which decreased basis points to in from for the average rates for both

contributing to the decline in interest income was a decrease in the average balance of securities  which were million lower for as compared to interest income from the loan portfolio decreased by thousand  or  to million for from million for the decline was due to lower average rates earned on loans  which decreased basis points to for the year ended december  from for the same period in the aforementioned decline was partly offset by an increase in the average balance of the loan portfolio  which grew million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  interest expense 
total interest expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the decrease was principally due to a decline in the average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities of basis points to in compared to in the decline in average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities was largely due to a decrease in rates paid on time deposits and savings deposits of basis points and basis points  respectively  for compared to the benefit derived from a decline in average rates more than offset the increase in interest expense associated with the growth of average interest bearing liabilities of million for compared to the prior year

our non performing loans increased thousand  or  to million at december  from million at december  we believe these loans are adequately provided for in our loan loss provision or are sufficiently collateralized at december  the provision for loan losses reflects management s judgment concerning the risks inherent in our existing loan portfolio and the size of the allowance necessary to absorb the risks  as well as the activity in the allowance during the periods 
management reviews the adequacy of its allowance on an ongoing basis and will provide additional provisions  as deemed necessary 
also see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements and allowance for loan losses and credit quality of financing receivables herein for further discussion 
non interest income 
non interest income consists of all income other than interest and dividend income and is principally derived from service charges on deposits  insurance commission income  commissions on sales of annuities and mutual funds  atm and debit card income  boli income and net gains on sale of securities and loans 
we recognize the importance of supplementing net interest income with other sources of income as it continues to explore new opportunities to generate non interest income 
non interest income was million for as compared to million for the decline of thousand  or  was largely due to lower insurance commissions of thousand  a decline in other income of thousand and a non cash other than temporary impairment charge of thousand related to an equity portfolio fund during the second quarter of the decline in other income was attributed to a decrease of thousand in mortgage banking fee income generated from our joint venture with pnc mortgage  inc also contributing to the decrease in non interest income for were declines in gains on the sale of fixed assets  foreclosed assets and securities  which were lower by thousand  thousand  and thousand  respectively  for as compared to the aforementioned decline was partly offset by an increase in boli income of thousand for as compared to non interest expense 
total non interest expense increased thousand  or  to million for as compared to the growth for was largely due to an increase of thousand in salaries and employee benefits and an increase in loan collection costs of thousand  or  as compared to the growth in salaries and employee benefits resulted from increases in salary expense of thousand  or  and higher benefits costs of thousand  or  for as compared to the prior year 
the increase in benefit costs was due in part to higher medical insurance premiums and recruiting costs 
the above mentioned increase was partly offset by a decline in write downs on foreclosed real estate of thousand 
income taxes 
provision for income taxes was thousand and thousand for and  respectively 
the company s effective tax rate was and for and  respectively

operational risk we are exposed to a variety of operational risks that can affect each of its business activities  particularly those involving processing and servicing of loans 
operational risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people or systems from external events 
the risk of loss also includes losses that may arise from potential legal actions that could result from operational deficiencies or noncompliance with contracts  laws or regulations 
we monitor and evaluate operational risk on an ongoing basis through systems of internal control  formal corporate wide policies and procedures  and an internal audit function 
liquidity  capital resources and off balance sheet arrangements liquidity 
a fundamental component of our business strategy is to manage liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient resources to meet all financial obligations and to finance prospective business opportunities 
liquidity management is critical to our stability 
our liquidity position over any given period of time is a product of our operating  financing and investing activities 
the extent of such activities is often shaped by such external factors as competition for deposits and loan demand 
traditionally  financing for our loans and investments is derived primarily from deposits  along with interest and principal payments on loans and investments 
at december   total deposits amounted to million  an increase of million  or  over the prior comparable year 
at december   advances 
index from the federal home loan bank of new york fhlbny and subordinated debentures totaled million and represented of total assets as compared to million and of total assets  at december  loan production continued to be the company principal investing activity 
net loans at december  amounted to million  an increase of million  or  compared to the same period in our most liquid assets are cash and due from banks and federal funds sold 
at december   the total of such assets amounted to million  or  of total assets  compared to million  or  of total assets at year end the decrease in liquid assets was driven by the investment of excess liquidity into securities 
another significant liquidity source is our available for sale securities 
at december   available for sale securities amounted to million compared to million at year end in addition to the aforementioned sources of liquidity  we have available various other sources of liquidity  including federal funds purchased from other banks and the federal reserve discount window 
the bank also has the capacity to borrow an additional million through its membership in the fhlbny and million at atlantic central bankers bank at december  management believes that our sources of funds are sufficient to meet our present funding requirements 
capital resources 
the bank s regulators have classified and defined bank capital as consisting of tier i capital  which includes tangible stockholders equity for common stock and certain preferred stock and other hybrid instruments  and tier ii capital  which includes a portion of the allowance for loan losses  certain qualifying long term debt and preferred stock which does not qualify for tier i capital 
the bank s regulators have implemented risk based guidelines which require banks to maintain certain minimum capital as a percent of such assets and certain off balance sheet items adjusted for predefined credit risk factors risk adjusted assets 
banks are required to maintain tier i capital as a percent of risk adjusted assets of and tier ii capital as of risk adjusted assets of at a minimum 
at december   the bank s tier i and tier ii capital ratios were and  respectively 
we also maintained thousand in cash and cash equivalents which could be contributed to the bank as capital 
in addition to the risk based guidelines discussed above  the bank s regulators require that banks which meet the regulators highest performance and operational standards maintain a minimum leverage ratio tier i capital as a percent of tangible assets of 
for those banks with higher levels of risk or that are experiencing or anticipating growth  the minimum will be proportionately increased 
minimum leverage ratios for each bank and bank holding company are established and updated through the ongoing regulatory examination process 
as of december   the bank had a leverage ratio of 
off balance sheet arrangements 
our financial statements do not reflect off balance sheet arrangements that are made in the normal course of business 
these off balance sheet arrangements consist of unfunded loans and letters of credit made under the same standards as on balance sheet instruments 
these unused commitments  at december  totaled million 
this consisted of million in commitments to grant commercial and residential loans  million in unfunded commitments under lines of credit and million in outstanding letters of credit 
these instruments have fixed maturity dates  and because many of them will expire without being drawn upon  they do not generally present any significant liquidity risk to us 
management believes that any amounts actually drawn upon can be funded in the normal course of operations 
market risk market risk is generally described as the sensitivity of income to adverse changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and other relevant market rates or prices 
market rate sensitive instruments include financial instruments such as investments  loans  mortgage backed securities  deposits  borrowings and other debt obligations  derivative financial instruments  such as futures  forwards  swaps and options  and derivative commodity instruments  such as commodity futures  forwards  swaps and options that are permitted to be settled in cash or another financial instrument 
we do not have any material exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk 
we did not enter into any market rate sensitive instruments for trading purposes nor did we engage in any trading or hedging transactions utilizing derivative financial instruments during our real estate loan portfolio  concentrated largely in northern new jersey  is subject to risks associated with the local and regional economies 
our primary source of market risk exposure arises from changes in market interest rates interest rate risk 

index interest rate risk interest rate risk is generally described as the exposure to potentially adverse changes in current and future net interest income resulting from fluctuations in interest rates  product spreads  and imbalances in the repricing opportunities of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
therefore  managing our interest rate sensitivity is a primary objective of our senior management 
our asset liability committee alco is responsible for managing the exposure to changes in market interest rates 
we manage interest rate risk exposure with the assistance of an independent third party who provides financial modeling and simulation modeling  analysis and reporting 
the reports provided by the third party are used to determine our exposure to market rate changes on net interest income and future economic value of equity 
our objective is to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of risk established by policy 
the techniques utilized for managing exposure to market rate changes involve a variety of interest rate  pricing and volume assumptions 
these assumptions include projections on growth  prepayment and withdrawal levels as well as other embedded options inherently found in financial instruments 
we review and validate these assumptions at least annually or more frequently if economic or other conditions change 
at december   we simulated the effects on net interest income given an instantaneous and parallel shift in the yield curve of up to a basis point rising interest rate environment and an basis point declining interest rate environment 
based on the simulation  it was estimated that net interest income  over a twelve month horizon  would not decrease by more than 
our interest rate risk management policies provide that net interest income should not decrease by more than if interest rates increase from current rates given an instantaneous and parallel shift in the yield curve of a basis point rise in rates or basis point decline in rates  respectively 
policy exceptions  if any  are reported to the board of directors 
at december   we were within policy limits established for changes in net interest income and future economic value of equity 
economic value of equity is defined as the market value of its assets less the market value of its liabilities plus or minus the market value of any off balance sheet positions 
the following table sets forth our interest rate risk profile at december  and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities and the impact on net interest income illustrated in the following table would vary substantially if different assumptions were used or if actual experience differs from that indicated by the assumptions 
down basis points was not presented for december  and due to the extremely low rate environment 
net portfolio value net interest income dollars in thousands change in interest rates estimated estimated increase decrease estimated net interest estimated increase decrease basis points npv amount percent income amount percent december  bp bp december  bp assumes an instantaneous and parallel shift in interest rates at all maturities 
npv  also referred to as economic value of equity  is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
assumes a gradual change in interest rates over a one year period at all maturities 
the simulation described above does not represent forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions  including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  we cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
further  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the simulation  actual results will also differ due to prepayment refinancing levels deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate changes on caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable 
index rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the simulation does not reflect actions that alco might take in response to anticipated changes in interest rates or competitive conditions in the market place 
impact of inflation and changing prices unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  the level of interest rates has a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or change with the same magnitude as the price of goods and services  which are affected by inflation 
accordingly  the liquidity  interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics of our assets and liabilities are more indicative of its ability to maintain acceptable performance levels 
management monitors and seeks to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes by attempting to match the maturities of assets and liabilities  thus seeking to minimize the potential effect of inflation
