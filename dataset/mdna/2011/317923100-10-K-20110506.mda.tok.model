critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates these estimates  including those related to the valuation of inventories  the potential impairment of long lived assets and income taxes 
the company bases the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
costs of sales 
costs of sales include the cost associated with acquiring merchandise from vendors  occupancy costs  provision for inventory shortages  and credits and allowances from our merchandise vendors 
cash consideration received from merchandise vendors after the related merchandise has been sold is recorded as an offset to cost of sales in the period negotiations are finalized 
for cash consideration received on merchandise still in inventory  the allowance is recorded as a reduction to the cost of on hand inventory and recorded as a reduction of our cost of sales at the time of sale 
because the company does not include the costs associated with operating its distribution facility and freight within cost of sales  the company s gross profit may not be comparable to those of other retailers that may include all costs related to their distribution facilities in costs of sales and in the calculation of gross profit 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued valuation of inventories 
merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using a weighted average cost method  which approximates the first in  first out method 
the company s valuation of inventory includes markdown adjustments for merchandise that will be sold below cost and the impact of shrinkage 
markdowns are based upon historical information and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
shrinkage is based on historical information and assumptions as to current shrink trends 
it is possible that changes to the markdowns and shrinkage estimates could be required in future periods due to changes in market conditions 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company reviews its long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company considers historical performance and future estimated results in its evaluation of potential impairment and then compares the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated non discounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by comparing projected individual store discounted cash flows to the asset carrying values 
the estimation of fair value is measured by discounting expected future cash flows at the discount rate the company utilizes to evaluate potential investments 
actual results may differ from these estimates and as a result the estimation of fair values may be adjusted in the future 
operating leases 
the company leases retail stores under operating leases 
many lease agreements contain rent holidays  rent escalation clauses and or contingent rent provisions 
the company recognizes rent expense for minimum lease payments on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  including cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty 
the company uses a time period for its straight line rent expense calculation that equals or exceeds the time period used for depreciation 
in addition  the commencement date of the lease term is the earlier of the date when the company becomes legally obligated for the rent payments or the date when the company takes possession of the leased space for buildout 
contingent rents are determined as a percentage of gross sales in excess of specified levels 
the company records a contingent rent liability in other liabilities and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets and the corresponding rent expense when specified levels have been achieved or when management determines that achieving the specified levels during the fiscal year is probable 
income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
under this method  the amount of taxes currently payable or refundable are accrued and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets are also recognized for realizable loss and tax credit carryforwards 
these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance  which is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in addition  management is required to estimate taxable income for future years by taxing jurisdictions and to consider this when making its judgment to determine whether or not to record a valuation allowance for part or all of a deferred tax asset 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in income tax rates is recognized in our consolidated statements of income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company s income tax returns  like those of most companies  are periodically audited by tax authorities 
these audits include questions regarding the company s tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
at any one time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities 
the company records an accrual for exposures after evaluating the positions associated with its various income tax filings 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which the company has established an accrual is audited and fully resolved or clarified 
the company adjusts its accrual for uncertain tax positions and income tax provision in the period in which matters 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from its established accrual  the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 
accruals of uncertain tax positions require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of tax audits 
actual results could vary from these estimates

recently issued accounting pronouncements did not  or are not believed by management to  have a material effect on the company s present or future consolidated financial statements
