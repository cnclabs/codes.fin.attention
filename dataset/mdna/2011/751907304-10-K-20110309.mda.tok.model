item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other financial data included elsewhere herein 
certain statements under this caption constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  and  as such  are based on current expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements for reasons including those risks discussed under part i item a risk factors  elsewhere in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  forward looking statements may be identified by the use of forward looking words or phrases such as will  may  believe  expect  intend  anticipate  could  should  plan  estimate  and potential  or other similar words 
critical accounting policies and estimates significant estimates 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to bad debts and sales returns and allowances  inventories  long lived assets  intangible assets  income taxes  accrued expenses  stock compensation accruals  and other contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience  market trends  financial forecasts and projections and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  and apply them on a consistent basis 
any factual errors or errors in these estimates and judgments may have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results 
recognition of revenue 
revenue from product sales to direct customers and distributors is recognized upon shipment as we generally do not have any post shipment obligations and allow limited rights of return to certain customers 
in the event a situation occurs to create a post shipment obligation  we would defer revenue recognition until the specific obligation was satisfied 
we defer recognition of sales to distributors when we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of product returns due to insufficient historical product return information 
the revenue recorded is dependent upon estimates of expected customer returns and sales discounts based upon both historical data and management estimates 
revenue from licensing programs is recognized over the period we are required to provide services under the terms of the agreement 
revenue from research and development activities that are funded by customers is recognized as the services are performed 
revenue from royalties is recognized upon the notification to us of shipment of product from our technology license partners to direct customers 
inventory valuation scrap 
we write down our inventory  with a resulting increase in our scrap expense  for estimated obsolescence or lack of marketability for the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts and returns 
we seek to maintain a stringent credit approval process although our management must make significant judgments in assessing our customers ability to pay at the time of shipment 
despite this assessment  from time to time  customers are unable to meet their payment obligations 
if we are aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record an allowance to reduce the receivable to the amount we believe we will be able to collect from the customer 
for all other customers  we record an allowance based upon the amount of time the receivables are past due and collection attempts 
if actual accounts receivable collections differ from these estimates  an adjustment to the allowance may be necessary with a resulting effect on operating expense 
we continue to monitor customers credit worthiness  and use judgment in establishing the estimated amounts of customer receivables which will ultimately not be collected 

table of contents an allowance for sales returns is established based on historical and current trends in product returns and customer rebates 
our distributors have a right to return products under certain conditions 
we recognize revenue on shipments to distributors at the time of shipment  along with a reserve for estimated returns based on historical data and future estimates 
also  certain distributors are granted rebates if specific end customers purchase our products 
at december  and  the company s reserve for sales returns was  and  respectively 
the increase in allowance from december  is primarily due to a new rebate program in our asia pacific region 
deferred income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we are required to estimate our income taxes on a consolidated basis 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements  and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
realization of the recorded deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in future years to obtain benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences and from tax credit and operating loss carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided to the extent that management deems it more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment up or down in future periods if estimates of future taxable income are changed 
future adjustments could materially affect our financial results as reported in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and  among other effects  could cause us not to achieve our projected results 
in assessing the potential to realize our deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences 
the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
long lived assets 
we review the carrying values of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable 
under current standards  the assets must be carried at historical cost if the projected cash flows from their use will recover their carrying amounts on an undiscounted basis and without considering interest 
however  if projected cash flows are less than their carrying value  the long lived assets must be reduced to their estimated fair value 
considerable judgment is required to project such cash flows and  if required  estimate the fair value of the impaired long lived asset 
the estimated future cash flows are based upon  among other things  assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows 
there can be no assurance that future long lived asset impairments will not occur 
share based payment assumptions 
we estimate volatility  forfeitures  and expected term of our options granted based upon historical data 
all of these variables have an effect on the estimated fair value of our share based awards 
results of operations overview our total revenue for the year ended december  was million 
in  of our revenue was derived from sales of our products and of our revenue was derived from customer sponsored research and development programs  royalties and other income

financial outlook the following statements are based on the company s financial targets for the first six months and full year these statements are forward looking  and actual results may differ materially from those set forth in these statements 
ramtron intends to continue its policy of not updating forward looking statements other than in publicly available documents  even if experience or future changes show that anticipated results or events will not be realized 
as a result of continuing high demand ahead of our ability to produce commercial f ram devices at our newest manufacturing line at ibm  we are presently experiencing product supply shortages and have begun placing customers on allocation 
the product supply shortages are expected to cause our revenue to decline from the level we experienced during the first half due to the delays in manufacturing at our new foundry  we have designed new products that will be built on our established manufacturing line at texas instruments 
we believe that once we have successfully reached full production of the new devices at our established foundry  our revenue will accelerate during the second half of for the first six months of  management currently anticipates total revenue of approximately million with a gross product margin of approximately

we do not expect a similar increase in as these unpackaged chip sales were custom built products and we no longer sell this product to the customer that ordered such custom built products 
product revenue was million  which was an increase of million from this increase was due primarily to increased unit demand from our customers combined with higher asps 
other revenue  consisting of license and development fees and royalty income  was  which was a decrease of million from the primary reason for the decrease was due to the recognition of non recurring other revenue in relating to a dram litigation settlement

liquidity and capital resources cash flow summary our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended december  and  are summarized as follows in thousands cash provided by used for operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
table of contents cash flow from operating activities the net amount of cash provided by operating activities during was million 
this was due primarily to earnings from operations after adjusting for non cash items and increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities during this was offset in part by an increase in accounts receivable 
the net amount of cash provided by operating activities during was million 
this was due primarily to earnings from operations after adjusting for non cash items primarily our non cash impairment charge and reduction in inventory and accounts receivable from the prior year end 
this was offset in part by a decrease in account payable and accrued liabilities 
cash flow used for investing activities the net amount of cash used for investing activities during was million  which was related primarily to million of capital purchases associated with our new foundry initiative 
we currently have approximately million of foundry related assets in construction in process at december  at the time we begin recognizing revenue related to the foundry production parts  we will begin depreciating this machinery on a straight line basis over ten years 
the net amount of cash used for investing activities during was million  which was primarily related to capital purchases associated with our new foundry initiative 
cash flow from used for financing activities the net amount of cash provided by financing activities during was million 
the primary source of cash was million of proceeds from our term loan obtained in june  partially offset by million of payments on our outstanding debt 
the net amount of cash used by financing activities during was  the primary use of cash for financing activities was for principal payments on our outstanding debt 
liquidity we had million in cash and cash equivalents at december   which included million in our money market account 
our future liquidity depends on revenue growth  steady gross margins  our foundry becoming operational  and control of operating expenses 
in addition to operating cash flow from product sales  we currently have approximately million available to us under a million secured line of credit facility 
this secured line of credit facility expires on august  we plan to renew our secured line of credit facility if acceptable terms are negotiated 
as of december   no balance was outstanding on the secured line of credit facility 
we have experienced delays in our new foundry project 
we have also almost depleted our supply of fujitsu supplied inventory and now depend on texas instruments to supply our f ram memory products 
as a result  our f ram product supply will be limited during the first half of and we do not expect to meet our fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under the svb credit facility for the first quarter of and possibly the second quarter of svb has waived compliance with this covenant along with our adjusted quick ratio for the first two quarters of they have replaced these covenants with a minimum liquidity ratio measured monthly and minimum ebitda measured on a quarterly basis 
we expect to meet these covenants 
due to the waiver and revised covenants  we are required to pay a  fee and our interest rate will increase  beginning march   from to  and revert back to on june  if the company cannot maintain compliance with its debt covenants  there is no assurance we would be able to negotiate further amendment relief or waivers of covenant compliance with svb 
failure to comply with our debt covenants and failure to negotiate a favorable amendment or waivers of covenant compliance could result in the acceleration of the maturity of our term loan  which would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity position and ability to continue operations unless alternative funding sources could be obtained 

table of contents our largest direct customer in of total sales in  compared to in has an overdue balance of  outstanding at december  this balance is of our total accounts receivable at december  
we have negotiated a payment schedule with this customer 
we believe the customer is financially solvent  but due to their overdue balance we cannot include it in our borrowing base 
ramtron is no longer selling to this customer 
we believe we have sufficient resources from cash on hand  funds from operations and availability under our secured line of credit facility to fund current operations through the end of if the new foundry project is further delayed  the company may be required to seek additional debt or equity capital to fund operations for mid and beyond 
we have contracted with ibm to provide us with facility design and fit up  tool installation and tool qualification services in support of ibm s manufacture of our f ram products 
we have provided certain tools  peripheral equipment  technology and specifications for ibm s manufacture of our products 
we have also provided our f ram technology and engineering expertise to ibm to assist in the integration and process development of our f ram products 
expenditures relating to capital and engineering support expenses for our new foundry project incurred from inception to date have been approximately million  and we estimate an additional  of capital expenditures and million of expenses for full year if we do not generate enough cash from our operations or have sufficient available borrowings under our secured line of credit facility  or if actual expenditures for capital and engineering support for our new foundry project are higher than estimated  the new foundry project could be further delayed and could be at risk of being cancelled 
if net cash flow is not sufficient to meet our cash requirements  we may use our line of credit facility mentioned earlier or any other credit facility we may obtain 
we are required to obtain approval from silicon valley bank for any additional debt financing  per the terms of our existing term loan agreement 
any issuance of common or preferred stock or convertible securities to obtain additional funding would result in dilution of our existing stockholders interests 
debt instruments on august   we executed an amended and restated loan and security agreement amended loan agreement with silicon valley bank svb 
the amended loan agreement provides for a million working capital line of credit with a million sublimit for exim advances  a million sublimit for foreign accounts receivable  and a sublimit of million for letters of credit and foreign exchange exposure and cash management services

the related borrowing base is comprised of the company s trade receivables 
we plan to draw upon our loan facility for working capital purposes as required 
the net availability under our secured line of credit facility as of december  was million
