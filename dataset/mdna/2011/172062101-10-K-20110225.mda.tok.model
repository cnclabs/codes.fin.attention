item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  which begins on page commercial lines property casualty insurance segment the commercial lines property casualty insurance segment contributed net earned premiums of billion to consolidated total revenues  or percent of that total  and reported a gain before income taxes of million in commercial lines net earned premiums declined percent in  percent in and percent in approximately percent of our commercial lines premiums are written to provide accounts with coverages from more than one of our business lines 
as a result  we believe that our commercial lines business is best measured and evaluated on a segment basis 
however  we provide line of business data to summarize growth and profitability trends separately for our business lines 
the seven commercial business lines are commercial casualty provides coverage to businesses against third party liability from accidents occurring on their premises or arising out of their operations  including liability coverage for injuries sustained from products sold as well as coverage for professional services  such as dentistry 
specialized casualty policies may include liability coverage for employment practices liability epli  which protects businesses against claims by employees that their legal rights as employees of the company have been violated  and against other acts or failures to act under specified circumstances  and excess insurance and umbrella liability  including personal umbrella liability written as an endorsement to commercial umbrella coverages 
the commercial casualty business line includes liability coverage written on both a discounted and nondiscounted basis as part of commercial package policies 
commercial property provides coverage for loss or damage to buildings  inventory and equipment caused by covered causes of loss such as fire  wind  hail  water  theft and vandalism  as well as business interruption resulting from a covered loss 
commercial property also includes crime insurance  which provides coverage for losses such as embezzlement or misappropriation of funds by an employee  among others  and inland marine insurance  which provides coverage for a variety of mobile equipment  such as contractor s equipment  builder s risk  cargo and electronic data processing equipment 
various property coverages can be written as stand alone policies or can be added to a package policy 
the commercial property business line includes property coverage written on both a nondiscounted and discounted basis as part of commercial package policies 
commercial auto protects businesses against liability to others for both bodily injury and property damage  medical payments to insureds and occupants of their vehicles  physical damage to an insured s own vehicle from collision and various other perils  and damages caused by uninsured motorists 
workers compensation protects employers against specified benefits payable under state or federal law for workplace injuries to employees 
we write workers compensation coverage in all of our active states except north dakota  ohio and washington  where coverage is provided solely by the state instead of by private insurers 
specialty packages includes coverages for property  liability and business interruption tailored to meet the needs of specific industry classes such as artisan contractors  dentists  garage operators  financial institutions  metalworkers  printers  religious institutions  or smaller main street businesses 
businessowners policies  which combine property  liability and business interruption coverages for small businesses  are included in specialty packages 
surety and executive risk this business line includes o contract and commercial surety bonds  which guarantee a payment or reimbursement for financial losses resulting from dishonesty  failure to perform and other acts 
o fidelity bonds  which cover losses that policyholders incur as a result of fraudulent acts by specified individuals or dishonest acts by employees 
o director and officer liability insurance  which covers liability for actual or alleged errors in judgment  breaches of duty or other wrongful acts related to activities of for profit or nonprofit organizations 
approximately percent of new policies and almost percent of director and officer new business premiums written in were for nonprofit entities 
our director and officer liability policy can optionally include epli coverage 
machinery and equipment specialized coverage provides protection for loss or damage to boilers and machinery  including production and computer equipment  from sudden and accidental mechanical breakdown  steam explosion or artificially generated electrical current 
our emphasis is on products that agents can market to small to midsized businesses in their communities 
of our  reporting agency locations  market only our surety and executive risk products and market only our personal lines products 
the remaining  locations  located in all states in which we actively market  offer some or all of our standard market commercial insurance products 
in  our highest volume commercial lines states generated percent of our earned premiums compared with percent in the prior year as we continued efforts to geographically diversify our property casualty risks 
earned premiums in the highest volume states decreased percent in and increased percent in the remaining states 
the number of reporting agency locations in our highest volume states increased to in from in commercial lines earned premiums by state dollars in millions earned premiums of total earned agency locations average premium per location year ended december  ohio illinois pennsylvania indiana north carolina virginia michigan georgia wisconsin tennessee year ended december  ohio illinois pennsylvania indiana north carolina michigan virginia georgia wisconsin iowa for new commercial lines business  case by case underwriting and pricing is coordinated by our locally based field marketing representatives 
our agents and our field marketing  claims  loss control  premium audit  bond and machinery and equipment representatives get to know the people and businesses in their communities and can make informed decisions about each risk 
these field marketing representatives also are responsible for selecting new independent agencies  coordinating field teams of specialized company representatives and promoting all of the company s products within the agencies they serve 
commercial lines policy renewals are managed by headquarters underwriters who are assigned to specific agencies and consult with local field staff as needed 
as part of our team approach  the headquarters underwriter also helps oversee agency growth and profitability 
they are responsible for formal issuance of all new business and renewal policies as well as policy endorsements 
further  the headquarters underwriters provide day to day customer service to agencies and marketing representatives by offering product training  answering underwriting questions  helping to determine underwriting eligibility and assisting with the mechanics of premium determination 
our emphasis on small to midsized businesses is reflected in the mix of our commercial lines premium volume by policy size 
nearly percent of our commercial in force policies have annual premiums of  or less  accounting in total for approximately one third of our commercial lines premium volume 
the remainder for policies with annual premiums greater than  includes in force policies with annual premiums greater than  that account for slightly less than percent of our commercial lines premium volume 
our commercial lines packages are typically offered on a three year policy term for most insurance coverages  a key competitive advantage 
in our experience  multi year packages appeal to the quality conscious insurance buyers who we believe are typical clients of our independent agents 
customized insurance programs on a three year term complement the long term relationships these policyholders typically have with their agents and with the company 
by reducing annual administrative efforts  multi year policies lower expenses for our company and for our agents 
the commitment we make to policyholders encourages long term relationships and reduces their need to annually re evaluate their insurance carrier or agency 
we believe that the advantages of three year policies in terms of improved policyholder convenience  increased account retention and reduced administrative costs outweigh the potential disadvantage of these policies  even in periods of rising rates 
although we offer three year policy terms  premiums for some coverages within those policies are adjustable at anniversary for the next annual period  and policies may be canceled at any time at the discretion of the policyholder 
contract terms often provide that rates for property  general liability  inland marine and crime coverages  as well as policy terms and conditions  are fixed for the term of the policy 
the general liability exposure basis may be audited annually 
commercial auto  workers compensation  professional liability and most umbrella liability coverages within multi year packages are rated at each of the policy annual anniversaries for the next one year period 
the annual pricing could incorporate rate changes approved by state insurance regulatory authorities between the date the policy was written and its annual anniversary date  as well as changes in risk exposures and premium credits or debits relating to loss experience and other underwriting judgment factors 
we estimate that approximately percent of commercial premiums were subject to annual rating or were written on a one year policy term 
staying abreast of evolving market conditions is a critical function  accomplished in both an informal and a formal manner 
informally  our field marketing representatives  underwriters and target markets department associates are in constant receipt of market intelligence from the agencies with which they work 
formally  our commercial lines product management group and field marketing associates conduct periodic surveys to obtain competitive intelligence 
this market information helps identify the top competitors by line of business or specialty program and also identifies our market strengths and weaknesses 
the analysis encompasses pricing  breadth of coverage and underwriting eligibility issues 
in addition to reviewing our competitive position  our product management group and our underwriting audit group review compliance with our underwriting standards as well as the pricing adequacy of our commercial insurance programs and coverages 
further  our target markets department analyzes opportunities and develops new products and services  new coverage options and improvements to existing insurance products 
we support our commercial lines operations with a variety of technology tools 
e clas cpp for commercial package and auto coverages now has rolled out to all of our appointed agencies in states 
it is being developed for additional coverages and states that will be deployed over time 
since the initial deployment of e clas in late  approximately one third of our non workers compensation commercial lines policies in force at the end of have been processed through e clas 
due to the three year policy term for much of our commercial lines business  some policies will not be due for renewal processing in e clas until in addition to increasing efficiency for our associates  the system allows our agencies to quote and print commercial package policies in their offices  increasing their ease of doing business with us 
the e clas platform also makes use of our real time agency interface  cincibridge  which allows the automated movement of key underwriting data from an agency s management system to e clas 
this reduces agents data entry tasks and allows seamless quoting  rating and issuance capability 
personal lines property casualty insurance segment the personal lines property casualty insurance segment contributed net earned premiums of million to consolidated total revenues  or percent of the total  and reported a loss before income taxes of million in personal lines net earned premiums grew percent in  after declining less than percent in and percent in we prefer to write personal lines coverage in accounts that include both auto and homeowner coverages as well as coverages that are part of our other personal business line 
as a result  we believe that our personal lines business is best measured and evaluated on a segment basis 
however  we provide line of business data to summarize growth and profitability trends separately for three business lines personal auto protects against liability to others for both bodily injury and property damage  medical payments to insureds and occupants of their vehicle  physical damage to an insured s own vehicle from collision and various other perils  and damages caused by uninsured motorists 
in addition  many states require policies to provide first party personal injury protection  frequently referred to as no fault coverage 
homeowners protects against losses to dwellings and contents from a wide variety of perils  as well as liability arising out of personal activities both on and off the covered premises 
the company also offers coverage for condominium unit owners and renters 
other personal lines this includes the variety of other types of insurance products we offer to individuals such as dwelling fire  inland marine  personal umbrella liability and watercraft coverages 
at year end  we marketed personal lines insurance products through  or approximately percent of our  reporting agency locations 
the  personal lines agency locations are in of the states in which we offer standard market commercial lines insurance and represent nearly percent of the reporting agency locations in the states 
during  we largely completed an initiative that began in to appoint for personal lines existing agencies marketing only our commercial lines insurance products 
we continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our marketing of personal lines to other states 
primary factors considered in the evaluation of a potential new state include weather related catastrophe history and the legal climate 
the number of reporting agency locations in our highest volume states increased percent to in from in in  our highest volume personal lines states generated percent of our earned premiums compared with percent in the prior year 
earned premiums in the highest volume states increased percent in while increasing percent in the remaining states  reflecting progress toward our long term objective of geographic diversification through new states for our personal lines operation

each agency selects personal lines business primarily from within the geographic territory that it serves  based on the agent s knowledge of the risks in those communities or familiarity with the policyholder 
personal lines activities are supported by headquarters associates assigned to individual agencies 
at year end  we had seven full time personal lines marketing representatives who have underwriting authority and visit agencies on a regular basis 
they focus primarily on key states targeted for growth  reinforcing the advantages of our personal lines products and offering training in the use of our processing system 
competitive advantages of our personal lines operation include broad coverage forms  flexible underwriting  superior claims service  generous credit structure and customizable endorsements for both the personal auto and homeowner policies 
our personal lines products are processed through diamond  our web based real time personal lines policy processing system that supports and allows streamlined processing 
diamond incorporates features frequently requested by our agencies such as pre filling of selected data for improved efficiency  easy to use screens  local and headquarters policy printing options  data transfer to and from popular agency management systems and real time integration with third party data such as insurance scores  motor vehicle reports and address verification 
excess and surplus lines property casualty insurance segment the excess and surplus lines property casualty segment contributed net earned premiums of million to consolidated total revenues  or percent of the total  and reported a loss before income taxes of million in  its third year of operation 
excess and surplus lines net earned premium increased percent in net earned premiums increased percent to million in our excess and surplus lines policies typically cover business risks with unique characteristics  such as the nature of the business or its claim history  that are difficult to profitably insure in the standard commercial lines market 
excess and surplus lines insurers have more flexibility in coverage terms and rates compared with standard lines companies  generally resulting in policies with higher rates and terms and conditions customized for specific risks  including restricted coverage where appropriate 
we target small to midsized risks  seeking to avoid those we consider exotic in nature 
our average excess and surplus lines policy size is approximately  in annual premiums  and policyholders in many cases also have standard market insurance with one of the cincinnati insurance companies 
approximately percent of our premium volume for the excess and surplus lines segment provided commercial casualty coverages and about percent provided commercial property coverages 
those coverages are described below 
commercial casualty covers businesses for third party liability from accidents occurring on their premises or arising out of their operations  including products and completed operations 
the majority of these policies have coverage limits of million or less 
miscellaneous errors and omissions and professional coverage for liability from actual or alleged errors in judgment  breaches of duty or other wrongful acts related to activities of insured businesses is also available  as is excess liability coverage that adds another layer of protection to other liability insurance policies 
typical businesses covered include contractors  consultants  bars or taverns  and manufacturers 
policies covering liability at special events are also available 
commercial property insures loss or damage to buildings  inventory  equipment and business income from causes of loss such as fire  wind  hail  water  theft and vandalism 
examples of property we commonly insure with excess and surplus lines policies include temporarily vacant buildings  restaurants and relatively higher hazard manufacturing classes 
at the end of  we marketed excess and surplus lines insurance products in of the states in which we offer standard market commercial lines insurance 
offering excess and surplus lines helps agencies representing the cincinnati insurance companies meet the insurance needs of their clients when coverage is unavailable in the standard market 
by providing outstanding service  we can help agencies grow and prosper while also profitably growing our property casualty business 
in  our highest volume excess and surplus lines states generated percent of our earned premiums compared with percent in the prior year 
excess and surplus lines earned premiums by state dollars in millions earned premiums of total earned year ended december  ohio indiana illinois georgia missouri michigan pennsylvania north carolina texas kentucky year ended december  ohio indiana illinois georgia michigan north carolina missouri wisconsin minnesota virginia agencies representing the cincinnati insurance companies write over billion in annual premiums for excess and surplus lines business for all carriers in total that they represent 
we estimate that approximately half of that premium volume matches the targeted business types and coverages we offer through our excess and surplus lines segment 
we structured the operations of this segment to meet the needs of these agencies and market exclusively through them 
agencies have access to the cincinnati specialty underwriters insurance company s product line through csu producer resources  the wholly owned insurance brokerage subsidiary of parent company cincinnati financial corporation 
csu producer resources has binding authority on all classes of business written through the cincinnati specialty underwriters insurance company and maintains appropriate agent and surplus lines licenses to process non admitted business 
we seek to earn a share of each agency s best excess and surplus lines accounts by offering several unique benefits 
agency producers have direct access through csu producer resources to a group of our underwriters who focus exclusively on excess and surplus lines business 
those underwriters can tap into agencies broader cincinnati relationships to bring their policyholders services such as experienced and responsive loss control and claims handling 
csu producer resources gives extra support to our producers by remitting surplus lines taxes and stamping fees and retaining admitted market diligent search affidavits  where required 
agencies marketing through csu producer resources generally receive a higher commission because use of our internal brokerage subsidiary eliminates some of the intermediary costs 
this business is also factored in their profit sharing agreement with the cincinnati insurance companies 
we use a web based excess and surplus lines policy administration system to quote  bind  issue and deliver policies electronically to agents 
this system also provides integration to existing document management and data management systems  allowing for real time processing of policies and billing 
it provides a specimen policy detailing coverages when a policy is quoted and delivers electronic copies of policies to producers within minutes of underwriting approval and policy issue 
in  more than percent of policies were issued within hours of a request to bind a policy 
also in  we received the celent model insurer award  recognizing our efficient use of technology 
we successfully leveraged our policy administration system to quickly enter a new market  developing our miscellaneous errors and omissions product in only three months and then issuing the first policies within two weeks 
life insurance segment the life insurance segment contributed million of net earned premiums  representing percent of consolidated total revenues  and million of income before income taxes in life insurance segment profitability is discussed in detail in item  life insurance results of operations  page life insurance net earned premiums grew percent in  percent in and less than percent in the cincinnati life insurance company supports our agency centered business model 
cincinnati life helps meet the needs of our agencies  including increasing and diversifying agency revenues

at year end  almost percent of our  property casualty reporting agency locations offered cincinnati life s products to their clients 
we also develop life business from approximately other independent life insurance agencies 
we are careful to solicit business from these other agencies in a manner that does not conflict with or compete with the marketing and sales efforts of our property casualty agencies 
when marketing through our property casualty agencies  we have specific competitive advantages because our property casualty operations are held in high regard  property casualty agency management is predisposed to consider selling our life products 
marketing efforts for both our property casualty and life insurance businesses are directed by our field marketing department  which assures consistency of communication and operations 
life field marketing representatives are available to meet face to face with agency personnel and their clients as well 
our life headquarters underwriters and other associates are available to the agents and field team to assist in the placement of business 
fewer and fewer of our competitors provide direct  personal support between the agent and the insurance carrier 
we continue to emphasize the cross serving opportunities of our life insurance  including term and worksite products  for the property casualty agency s personal and commercial accounts 
in both the property casualty and independent life agency distribution systems  we enjoy the advantages of offering competitive  up to date products  providing close personal attention in combination with financial strength and stability

our investment department operates under guidelines set forth in our investment policy statement along with oversight of the investment committee of our board of directors 
these guidelines set parameters for risk tolerances governing  among other items  the allocation of the portfolio as well as security and sector concentrations 
these parameters are part of an integrated corporate risk management program 
the fair value of our investment portfolio was billion and billion at year end and  respectively 
the overall portfolio remained in an unrealized gain position as strong returns in the equity and corporate bond markets more than offset a decline in the municipal bond market
