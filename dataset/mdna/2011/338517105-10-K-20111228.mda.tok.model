without giving effect to the above non recurring item  our net income attributable to stockholders for our fiscal year would have decreased  or to  new limited partnership restaurants during our fiscal years and  we did not have a new restaurant location in the development stage and did not recognize any pre opening costs 
while we currently have no new restaurants under development  if we are to open new restaurants  our income from operations will be adversely affected due to our obligation to fund pre opening costs  including but not limited to pre opening rent for the new locations 
we believe that our current cash on hand  together with our expected cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 

table of contents trends during the next twelve months  we expect that our gross profit for restaurant food and bar sales will increase due primarily to an increase in menu prices instituted during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  offset by a general increase in food costs  including an increase in our cost of ribs during calendar year we expect package store sales to remain stable  although we expect the gross profit margin for package store sales to decrease due to our inability to purchase close out and inventory reduction merchandise from wholesalers 
we expect higher food costs and higher overall expenses to adversely affect our net income 
we also increased our advertising to attract and retain our customers against increased competition 
with these menu price increases  we plan to limit further menu price increases as long as possible  but continue to face increased competition and expect higher food costs and higher overall expenses  which will adversely affect our net income 
we may be required to raise menu prices wherever competitively possible 
although we have no new restaurant in development  we continue to search for new locations to open restaurants and thereby expand our business  but we are now looking for locations that will not require an extensive and costly renovation 
any new locations will likely be opened using our limited partnership ownership model 
we are not actively searching for locations for the operation of new package liquor stores  but if an appropriate location for a package liquor store becomes available  we will consider it 
liquidity and capital resources we fund our operations through our cash on hand and positive cash flow from operations 
as of october   we had cash of approximately  a decrease of  from our cash balance of  as of october  the decrease in cash as of october  was primarily due to i our expending approximately  for the cash portion of the purchase price required to close on the purchase of the real property and building where our combination restaurant and package liquor store located at biscayne boulevard  north miami  florida  store operates  offset by  we borrowed from a related third party at the end of the first quarter  which loan is secured by a mortgage on the real property and building  and ii our expending approximately  for renovations to one existing company owned restaurant 
management believes that the company s current cash availability from its cash on hand and the expected cash from operations will be sufficient to fund operations and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of the end of our fiscal year or our fiscal year critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements located in item of this annual report on form k 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies are subject to estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements estimated useful lives of property and equipment the estimates of useful lives for property and equipment are significant estimates 
expenditures for the leasehold improvements and equipment when a restaurant is first constructed are material 
in addition  periodic refurbishing takes place and those expenditures can be material 
we estimate the useful life of those assets by considering  among other things  expected use  life of the lease on the building  and warranty period  if applicable 
the assets are then depreciated using a straight line method over those estimated lives 
these estimated lives are reviewed periodically and adjusted if necessary 
any necessary adjustment to depreciation expense is made in the income statement of the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary 
consolidation of limited partnerships as of october   we operate eight restaurants as general partner of the limited partnerships that own the operations of these restaurants 
additionally  we expect that any expansion which takes place in opening new restaurants will also result in us operating the restaurants as general partner 
in addition to the general partnership interest we also purchase limited partnership units ranging from to of the total units outstanding 
as a result of these controlling interests  we consolidate the operations of these limited partnerships with ours despite the fact that we do not own in excess of of the equity interests 
all intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation 
the minority interests in the earnings of these limited partnerships are removed from net income and are not included in the calculation of earnings per share

for discussion regarding our carryforwards refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year other matters impact of inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food  beverage and labor costs 
a large number of restaurant personnel are paid at rates based upon applicable minimum wage and increases in minimum wage directly affect labor costs
