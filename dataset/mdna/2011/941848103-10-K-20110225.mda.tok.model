the company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  past transaction history with the customer  the credit worthiness of the customer  industry trends and the macro economic environment 
historically  the company has not experienced significant bad debt losses 
sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue 
material differences may 
table of contents result in the amount and timing of revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates for sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts 
the company s accounts receivable balance at december  was million  net of allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns of million 
the company values all of its inventories at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out basis fifo 
the company estimates revisions to its inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence  historical demand  projections of future demand  including that in the company s current backlog of orders  and industry and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
the company s inventory balance at december  was million  net of write downs to net realizable value of million 
long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors the company considers important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  and  significant changes or developments in strategic technological collaborations or legal matters which affect the company s capitalized patents  trademarks and intellectual properties  such as licenses 
when the company determines that the carrying value of an individual intangible asset  long lived asset or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators  an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that intangible asset  long lived asset or goodwill  including its eventual residual value  is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists 
in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
net intangible assets  long lived assets and goodwill amounted to million  million and million  respectively  as of december  the company performs annual impairment reviews of its goodwill on january of each year 
for goodwill impairment review purposes  the company has two reporting units  the waters division and ta 
the company currently does not expect to record an impairment charge in the foreseeable future  however  there can be no assurance that  at the time future reviews are completed  a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
the factors that could cause a material goodwill impairment charge in the future include  but are not limited to  the following a significant decline in the company s projected revenue  earnings or cash flows  a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate  a significant decline in the company s stock price or the stock price of comparable companies  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  and  unanticipated competition 
warranty product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments 
while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure

at december   the company s warranty liability was million 

table of contents income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves the company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing changes in temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  amortization and inventory reserves  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods  the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 
the accounting standard for income taxes requires that a company continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  depending on whether it is more likely than not that actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods 
in addition  the company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting positions in accordance with the income taxes accounting standard  which requires financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions  as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances  but it prohibits any discounting of any of the related tax effects for the time value of money 
at december   the company had unrecognized tax benefits of million 
litigation as described in item  legal proceedings  of part i of this form k  the company is a party to various pending litigation matters 
with respect to each pending claim  management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and  if so  the probable range of that loss 
if and when management has determined  with respect to a particular claim  both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss  the company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss 
the company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable interpretation 
with respect to the claims referenced in item  management of the company to date has been able to make this determination and thus has recorded charges with respect to the claims described in item as developments occur in these matters and additional information becomes available  management of the company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their range  which may result in its recording charges or additional charges which could materially impact the company s results of operations or financial position 
pension and other retirement benefits assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company s pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management 
changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data 
critical assumptions  such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  are evaluated and updated annually 
the company has assumed that the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be for its us benefit plans and for its us benefit plans 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled 
the company determined the discount rate based on the analysis of the mercer and citigroup pension discount curves for high quality investments and the moody s aa interest rate as of december  that best matched the timing of the plan s future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits 
once the interest rates were determined  the plan s cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date 
at december   the company determined the weighted average discount rate to be for the us benefit plans and for the us benefits plans 
a one quarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the company s net periodic benefit cost for the waters retirement plan by less than million 
a one quarter percentage point increase in the assumed long term rate of return would decrease the company s net periodic benefit cost for the waters retirement plan by less than million 

table of contents stock based compensation the accounting standard for stock based compensation requires that all share based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values 
the company has used the black scholes model to determine the fair value of its stock option awards 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and the company s results of operations could be materially impacted 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest  the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
this accounting standard requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of this accounting standard  the compensation expense that the company records in future periods may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period 
the company adopted the modified prospective transition method permitted under the stock based compensation accounting standard and  consequently  has not adjusted results from prior years 
under the modified transition method  compensation costs now include expense relating to the remaining unvested awards granted prior to december  and the expense related to any awards issued subsequent to december  the company recognizes the expense using the straight line attribution method 
as of december   unrecognized compensation costs and related weighted average lives over which the costs will be amortized were as follows in millions unrecognized compensation weighted average costs life in years stock options restricted stock units restricted stock total recent accounting standard changes and developments recently adopted accounting standards in june  a new accounting standard was issued relating to the consolidation of variable interest entities 
this statement addresses the effects on certain provisions of existing accounting standards as a result of the elimination of the qualifying special purpose entity concept and constituent concerns about the application of certain key provisions of existing accounting standards  including those in which the accounting and disclosures under existing accounting standards do not always provide timely and useful information about an enterprise s involvement in a variable interest entity 
this standard is effective for periods beginning after november  the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in january  the company adopted a newly issued accounting standard which requires additional disclosure about the amounts of and reasons for significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements 
this standard also clarifies existing disclosure requirements related to the level of disaggregation of fair value measurements for each class of assets and liabilities and disclosure about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring level and level measurements 
as this newly issued accounting standard only requires enhanced disclosure  the adoption of this standard did not impact the company s financial position or results of operations 
in addition  effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   this standard will require additional disclosure and require an entity to present disaggregated information about activity in level fair value measurements on a gross basis  rather than as one net amount 

table of contents recently issued accounting standards in october  a new accounting consensus was issued for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this consensus amends existing revenue recognition accounting standards 
this consensus provides accounting principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangement should be separated and the consideration allocated 
this guidance eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
previously  the existing accounting consensus required that the fair value of the undelivered item be the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when the item is sold separately by the vendor 
under the existing accounting consensus  if the fair value of all of the elements in the arrangement was not determinable  then revenue was deferred until all of the items were delivered or fair value was determined 
this new approach is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  the adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
also in october  a new accounting consensus was issued for certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
this consensus amends the existing accounting guidance for revenue arrangements that contain tangible products and software 
this consensus requires that tangible products which contain software components and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible products essential functionality are no longer within the scope of the software revenue guidance 
this new approach is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  the adoption of this standard will not have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings  cash flows and stockholders equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company attempts to minimize its exposures by using certain financial instruments  for purposes other than trading  in accordance with the company s overall risk management guidelines 
the company is primarily exposed to currency exchange rate risk with respect to certain inter company balances  forecasted transactions and cash flow  and net assets denominated in euro  japanese yen  british pound and singapore dollar 
the company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis  which allows the company to analyze exposures globally and take into account offsetting exposures in certain balances 
in addition  the company utilizes derivative and non derivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to currency fluctuations 
the company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates 
the company s policy is to manage interest costs by using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt that management believes is appropriate 
at times  to manage this mix in a cost efficient manner  the company has periodically entered into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional amount 
hedge transactions the company records its hedge transactions in accordance with the accounting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes the accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
all derivatives  whether designated in hedging relationships or not  are required to be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value as either assets or liabilities 
if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings 
if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings  ineffective portions of changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
in addition  disclosures required for 
table of contents derivative instruments and hedging activities include the company s objectives for using derivative instruments  the level of derivative activity the company engages in  as well as how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect the company s financial position and performance 
the company currently uses derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency and interest rate risks 
the company s objectives for holding derivatives are to minimize foreign currency and interest rate risk using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impact of foreign currency and interest rate exposures 
the company documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items and links all derivatives designated as fair value  cash flow or net investment hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets or to specific forecasted transactions 
in addition  the company considers the impact of its counterparties credit risk on the fair value of the contracts as well as the ability of each party to execute under the contracts 
the company also assesses and documents  both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows associated with the hedged items 
cash flow hedges the company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates related to outstanding us dollar floating rate debt 
in august  the company entered into two floating to fixed rate interest rate swaps  each with a notional amount of million and maturity dates of april and october  to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan facility of its outstanding debt 
at both december  and  the company had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements 
for the year ended december   the company recorded a change of million in accumulated other comprehensive income on the interest rate agreements 
for the year ended december   the company recorded a cumulative net pre tax unrealized loss of million in accumulated other comprehensive income on the interest rate agreements 
for the years ended december  and  the company recorded additional interest expense of million and million  respectively 
other the company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts  principally to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on certain inter company balances and short term assets and liabilities 
principal hedged currencies include the euro  japanese yen  british pound and singapore dollar 
the periods of these forward contracts typically range from one to three months and have varying notional amounts  which are intended to be consistent with changes in the underlying exposures 
gains and losses on these forward contracts are recorded in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
at december   and  the company held forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling million  million and million  respectively 
at both december  and  the company had assets of less than million in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets related to the foreign currency exchange contracts

for the year ended december   the company recorded cumulative net pre tax losses of million  which consist of realized losses of million relating to the closed forward contracts and million of unrealized losses relating to the open forward contracts 
assuming a hypothetical adverse change of in year end exchange rates a strengthening of the us dollar  the fair market value of the forward contracts outstanding as of december  would decrease pre tax earnings by approximately million
