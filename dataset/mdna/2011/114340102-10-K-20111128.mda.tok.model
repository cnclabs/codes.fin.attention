overview we are a leading provider of automation  vacuum and instrumentation solutions for multiple markets and are a valued business partner to original equipment manufacturers oems and equipment users throughout the world 
we serve markets where equipment productivity and availability is a critical factor for our customers success  typically in demanding temperature and or pressure environments 
our largest served market is the semiconductor capital equipment industry  which represented approximately and of our consolidated revenues for fiscal years and  respectively 
we have targeted certain non semiconductor revenue opportunities and made recent acquisitions and a divestiture which has led to an increase in the non semiconductor portion of our revenues 
for the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the semiconductor capital equipment portion of our revenues declined to 
the non semiconductor markets served by us include life sciences  industrial capital equipment  and other adjacent markets which includes clean energy 
the demand for semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment is cyclical  resulting in periodic expansions and contractions 
demand for our products has been impacted by these cyclical industry conditions 
we expect the semiconductor equipment market will continue to be a key end market for our products  however  we intend to acquire and develop technologies that will create opportunities outside of the semiconductor equipment market 
on april   we acquired rts life sciences rts  a united kingdom based provider of automation solutions to the life sciences markets 
the purchase price was approximately million  net of cash on hand 
on july   we acquired nexus biosystems  inc nexus  a us based provider of automation solutions and consumables to the life sciences markets  specifically biobanking and compound sample management 
the company paid  in cash  an aggregate merger consideration of million  net of cash on hand to acquire nexus 
on april   we entered into an agreement with affiliates of celestica inc the buyers to sell the assets of our extended factory contract manufacturing business the business 
the buyers also agreed to assume certain liabilities related to the business the asset sale 
the asset sale was completed on june  the closing 
at the closing  the buyers paid brooks a total purchase price of million in cash  plus million as consideration for cash acquired in the asset sale 
an additional million of proceeds was paid during our fourth quarter of  which represents a working capital normalizing adjustment 
brooks and the buyers also entered into certain commercial supply and license agreements at the closing which will govern the ongoing relationship between the buyers and brooks 
pursuant to those agreements  brooks will supply the buyers with certain products and has licensed to the buyers certain intellectual property needed to run the business and the buyers will supply certain products to brooks 
effective as of the beginning of our third quarter of fiscal year  we implemented a financial reporting structure that included three segments brooks product solutions  brooks global services and contract manufacturing 
this structure was implemented in response to changes in our management structure and in anticipation of the sale of our contract manufacturing segment 
effective as of the beginning of our fourth quarter of fiscal year 
table of contents  we added a fourth segment  brooks life science systems  which includes the operations of the businesses acquired from rts and nexus  which have been consolidated into one operating segment 
historic results included in this annual report have been reclassified where applicable to conform to this new operating segment structure 
the brooks product solutions segment provides a variety of products critical to technology equipment productivity and availability 
those products include atmospheric and vacuum tool automation systems  atmospheric and vacuum robots and robotic modules and cryogenic vacuum pumping  thermal management and vacuum measurement solutions used to create  measure and control critical process vacuum applications 
the brooks global services segment provides an extensive range of support services including on and off site repair services  on and off site diagnostic support services  and installation services to enable our customers to maximize process tool uptime and productivity 
this segment also provides end user customers with spare part support services to maximize customer tool productivity 
the brooks life science systems segment provides automated sample management systems including automated sample storage  automated blood fractionation equipment  sample preparation and handling equipment  consumables  parts and support services to wide range of life science customers including pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  biobanks  national laboratories  research institutes and research universities 
the contract manufacturing segment provided services to build equipment front end modules and other subassemblies which enable our customers to effectively develop and source high quality and high reliability process tools for semiconductor and adjacent market applications 
we sold this segment in the asset sale which closed on june  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  goodwill  income taxes  warranty obligations  pensions and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  including current and anticipated worldwide economic conditions both in general and specifically in relation to the semiconductor industry  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
as discussed in the year over year comparisons below  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenues product revenues are associated with the sale of hardware systems  components and spare parts as well as product license revenue 
service revenues are associated with service contracts  repairs  upgrades and field service 
shipping and handling fees  if any  billed to customers are recognized as revenue 
the related shipping and handling costs are recognized in cost of sales 
revenue from product sales that does not include significant customization is recorded upon delivery and transfer of risk of loss to the customer provided there is evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and  if applicable  customer acceptance criteria have been successfully demonstrated 
customer acceptance provisions include final testing and acceptance carried out prior to shipment 
these pre shipment testing and acceptance procedures ensure that the product meets the published specification requirements before the product is shipped 
when significant on site customer acceptance provisions are present in the arrangement  revenue is recognized upon completion of customer acceptance testing 
revenue from product sales that does include significant customization  which primarily include life science automation systems  is recorded using the percentage of completion method whereby revenue is recorded as work progresses based on a percentage that incurred costs to date bear to total estimated costs 
in addition  contracts are 
table of contents reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether a loss exists 
a loss will be accrued in the period in which estimated contract revenue is less than the current estimate of total contract costs 
revenue associated with service agreements is generally recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
revenue from repair services or upgrades of customer owned equipment is recognized upon completion of the repair effort and upon the shipment of the repaired item back to the customer 
in instances where the repair or upgrade includes installation  revenue is recognized when the installation is completed 
intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets as a result of our acquisitions  we have identified intangible assets other than goodwill and generated significant goodwill 
general intangible assets other than goodwill are valued based on estimates of future cash flows and amortized over their estimated useful life 
goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing as well as testing upon the occurrence of any event that indicates a potential impairment 
general intangible assets other than goodwill and other long lived assets are subject to an impairment test if there is an indicator of impairment 
we conduct our annual goodwill impairment test as of our fiscal year end  or september th 
under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the testing of goodwill for impairment is to be performed at a level referred to as a reporting unit 
a reporting unit is either the operating segment level or one level below  which is referred to as a component 
the level at which the impairment test is performed requires an assessment as to whether the operations below the operating segment constitute a self sustaining business  testing is generally required to be performed at this level 
we currently have three reporting units that have goodwill  including two reporting units that are part of our brooks product solutions operating segment and the sole reporting unit included in our brooks life science systems operating segment 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach  specifically the discounted cash flow method dcf method 
the dcf method includes five year future cash flow projections  which are discounted to present value  and an estimate of terminal values  which are also discounted to present value 
terminal values represent the present value an investor would pay today for the rights to the cash flows of the business for the years subsequent to the discrete cash flow projection period 
we consider the dcf method to be the most appropriate valuation indicator as the dcf analyses are based on management s long term financial projections 
goodwill impairment testing is a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its respective carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired 
if the reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds the fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be completed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying value of goodwill 
the implied fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  the excess of the fair value over amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill determined in this step is compared to the carrying value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference 
we recorded goodwill impairment charges of million in the three month period ended march  the details of this goodwill impairment charge are discussed further under the impairment charges caption in our comparison of fiscal year and results 
our tests of goodwill as of september   and indicated that we did not have any further impairment to goodwill 
under gaap  we are required to test long lived assets  which exclude goodwill and intangible assets that are not amortized  when indicators of impairment are present 
for purposes of this test  long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
when we determine that indicators of potential impairment exist  the next step of the impairment test requires that the potentially impaired long lived asset group is tested for recoverability 
the test for recoverability compares the undiscounted future cash flows of the long lived asset group to its carrying value 
if the carrying values of the long lived asset group exceed the future cash flows  the assets are considered to be potentially impaired 
the next step in the impairment process is to determine the fair value of the individual net 
table of contents assets within the long lived asset group 
if the aggregate fair values of the individual net assets of the group are less than the carrying values  an impairment charge is recorded equal to the excess of the aggregate carrying value of the group over the aggregate fair value 
the loss is allocated to each asset within the group based on their relative carrying values  with no asset reduced below its fair value 
we recorded impairment charges of million related to certain long lived assets in the year ended september   which we discuss in further detail under the impairment charges caption 
we have not tested long lived assets other than goodwill since  since no events have occurred that would require an impairment assessment 
accounts receivable we record trade accounts receivable at the invoiced amount 
trade accounts receivables do not bear interest 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we determine the allowance based on historical write off experience 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly 
past due balances are reviewed individually for collectibility 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when we feel it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is estimated by assessing product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and may result in additional benefits or charges to operations 
inventory we provide reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we fully reserve for inventories and noncancelable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete 
we perform periodic reviews of all inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on hand balances to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand  based upon sales and marketing inputs through our planning systems 
if estimates of demand diminish further or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in excess of their net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we subsequently determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
management has considered the weight of all available evidence in determining whether a valuation allowance continues to be required against its deferred tax assets 
we continued to provide a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets at september   as we believe it is more likely than not that the future tax benefits from accumulated net operating losses and other temporary differences will not be realized 
we will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance in future periods 
if we continue to generate profits in most of our jurisdictions  it is reasonably possible that there will be a significant reduction in the valuation allowance in the next twelve months 
reduction of the valuation allowance  in whole or in part  would result in a non cash income tax benefit during the period of reduction 

table of contents pension plans we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan in the us and two non us defined benefit pension plans 
the cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working  the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease 
major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels 
assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third party actuaries  and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date 
net periodic pension costs for our pension plans totaled million for fiscal year our unfunded benefit obligation totaled million at september   as compared to million at september  should any of our assumptions change  they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation 
we expect to contribute approximately million to our defined benefit pension plans during fiscal year stock based compensation we measure compensation cost for all employee stock awards at fair value on date of grant and recognize compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of restricted stock is determined based on the number of shares granted and the excess of the quoted price of our common stock over the exercise price of the restricted stock on the date of grant  if any  and the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
such value is recognized as expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires significant judgment 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
in addition  for stock based awards where vesting is dependent upon achieving certain operating performance goals  we estimate the likelihood of achieving the performance goals 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ from our current estimates 
restricted stock with market based vesting criteria is valued using a lattice model 
year ended september   compared to year ended september  revenues we reported revenues of million for fiscal year  compared to million in the previous year  a increase 
the total increase in revenues of million is the result of increased demand for our products and services which resulted in million of increased revenues from our brooks product solutions segment and million of higher revenues from our brooks global services segment 
in addition  the acquisitions of rts and nexus provided million of increased revenues from our brooks life science systems segment 
these increases were partially offset by an million decrease in contract manufacturing revenues  due to the sale of that segment at the end of our third fiscal quarter 
recent order rates from semiconductor companies have moderated and we anticipate that revenues for our first quarter of fiscal year will be to lower than those achieved for the fourth quarter of fiscal year our brooks product solutions segment reported revenues of million for fiscal year  an increase of from million in the prior year 
these increases are primarily attributable to higher volumes of shipments to semiconductor capital equipment customers  which increased million for fiscal year as compared to the prior year  and an increase of million from non semiconductor customers for fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
our brooks global services segment reported revenues of million for fiscal year  a increase from million in the prior year 
the increase includes a million increase in product revenues  which are comprised mostly of spare part sales to end users  and a million increase in revenues from services 
these increases are primarily attributable to increased demand from our semiconductor customers 
our brooks life science systems segment reported revenues of million for fiscal year this segment includes revenues for rts  which was acquired on april  and for nexus  which was acquired on july  revenues from these newly acquired entities are included in our operating results from their 
table of contents respective acquisition dates through the end of our fiscal year 
revenue from this segment includes million for the sale of product  including automation systems and consumables  and includes million of service revenue for the support of deployed automation systems 
our contract manufacturing segment reported revenues of million for fiscal year  a decrease from million in the prior year 
this decrease is due to the sale of this segment at the end of our third fiscal quarter 
through the first nine months of fiscal year  contract manufacturing revenues increased as compared to the same prior year period 
revenues from the brooks product solutions segment for the fiscal years and include intercompany sales of million and million  respectively  from this segment to the contract manufacturing segment 
these intercompany revenues have been eliminated from the revenues of contract manufacturing 
revenues for the contract manufacturing segment for the fiscal years and exclude intercompany sales of million and million  respectively  from this segment to the brooks product solutions segment 
revenues outside the united states were million  or of total revenues  and million  or of total revenues  for fiscal years and  respectively 
we expect that foreign revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of total revenues 
gross margin gross margin dollars increased to million for fiscal year as compared to million in the prior year 
this increase was attributable to higher revenues of million and the acquisitions of rts and nexus which increased gross margin by million 
these increases were partially offset by reduced benefits from the sale of previously reserved excess and obsolete inventory 
the net benefit in the prior period exceeded the net charge in the current period by million 
gross margin was reduced by million of amortization expense for completed technology intangible assets  as compared to million in the prior year period 
this increase in amortization expense is primarily due to the acquisitions of rts and nexus 
gross margin percentage increased to for fiscal year  compared to for the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributable to higher absorption of indirect factory overhead on higher revenues 
further  the sale of our contract manufacturing segment  which earned lower gross margins than our other operating segments  favorably impacted our gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter of fiscal year we estimate that the impact of the sale of contract manufacturing will increase our annual gross margin percentage by approximately as compared to historical levels that included the operations of the business 
these increases in gross margin percentage were partially offset by reduced benefits from the sale of previously reserved excess and obsolete inventory 
the increase in the net charge for excess and obsolete inventory in fiscal year as compared to the prior year decreased gross margin percentage by 
gross margin of our brooks product solutions segment increased to million for fiscal year as compared to million for the prior year 
this increase was attributable to higher revenues of million for fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
this increase was offset by reduced benefits from the sale of previously reserved excess and obsolete inventory 
the net benefit in the prior period exceeded the net charge in the current period by million 
gross margin for this segment was reduced by amortization of completed technology intangible assets of million for both fiscal year and gross margin percentage for this segment was for fiscal year as compared to in the prior year 
this increase is primarily the result of higher absorption of indirect factory overhead on higher revenues 
this increase was partially offset by increased net charges for excess and obsolete inventory which reduced gross margin percentage by as compared to the prior year 
gross margin of our brooks global services segment increased to million for fiscal year as compared to million in the prior year 
the increase was attributable to higher revenues of million for fiscal year as compared to the prior year and million of reduced charges for excess and obsolete inventory as compared to the prior year 
gross margin was reduced by million for amortization of completed technology intangible assets for fiscal years and gross margin percentage was for fiscal year as compared to in the prior year 
the increase in gross margin percentage was attributable to higher absorption 
table of contents of indirect service overhead on higher revenues 
in addition  decreased charges for excess and obsolete inventory led to an increase in gross margin percentage of for fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
gross margin for our brooks life science systems segment was million for fiscal year  and includes only those amounts earned since the acquisition date of rts and nexus 
gross margin has been reduced by million for the impact of the valuation of inventory and deferred revenue obligations as of the purchase date for both rts and nexus 
gross margin has also been reduced by million for charges for excess and obsolete inventory related to nexus  based on a review of inventories performed by us after the acquisition date 
gross margin was reduced by million for amortization of completed technology intangible assets 
gross margin percentage was for fiscal year  and has been reduced for the impact of the valuation of deferred revenue obligations and the step up in value of acquired inventory 
gross margin percentage was also decreased by for charges for excess and obsolete inventories 
gross margin was further reduced by for amortization of completed technology intangible assets 
gross margin of our contract manufacturing segment decreased slightly to million for fiscal year as compared to million for the prior year 
this decrease is due to an million decrease in revenues  caused by the sale of this segment at the end of our third quarter 
for the first nine months of fiscal year  revenues for contract manufacturing had increased over the same prior year period 
this increase in revenues led to higher absorption of indirect factory overhead and resulted in a higher gross margin percentage 
gross margin percentage was for fiscal year as compared to in the prior year 
research and development research and development  or r d  expenses for fiscal year were million  an increase of million  compared to million in the previous year 
this increase includes million of r d costs incurred by rts and nexus since their respective acquisition dates 
the balance of the increase is the result of our increased pace of spending for r d throughout fiscal year as we support enhancements to our current product offerings and our strategy to grow longer term revenues outside of the semiconductor market 
we expect the rate of growth in r d spending to moderate in the near term from the levels incurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses were million for fiscal year  an increase of million compared to million in the prior year 
the increase is partly attributable to higher labor related costs of million as a result of increased accruals for incentive based compensation due to our improved financial performance  combined with a increase in sg a headcount 
we have included the results of rts and nexus in our results since their respective acquisition dates  which increased our sg a costs by million  which includes a million increase in amortization of intangible assets 
other increases in sg a costs include outside strategic consulting costs of million  professional fees associated with the acquisition of nexus of million  higher commissions to independent sales representatives of million due to higher revenues and million of increased legal fees associated with our intellectual property portfolio as we increase our investments in r d 
restructuring charges we recorded a restructuring charge of million for fiscal year these charges include severance related costs of million  which are comprised of million of severance for the elimination of employees  including employees in the brooks life science systems segment resulting from the consolidation of certain functions as the operations of rts and nexus are combined into one operating segment  and million of adjustments for contingent severance arrangements for corporate management positions eliminated in prior periods 
we also incurred million of facility related costs for facilities exited in previous years 
we have reached the end 
table of contents of the lease period for all of our exited leased facilities as of september   and do not expect further restructuring costs related to these facilities 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million for fiscal year these charges include severance related costs of million  and facility related costs of million 
the severance costs primarily include adjustments for contingent severance arrangements for corporate management positions eliminated in prior periods 
the facility costs include million to amortize the deferred discount on multi year facility restructuring liabilities 
in addition  we revised the present value discounting of multi year facility related restructuring liabilities during the first quarter of fiscal year when certain accounting errors were identified in our prior period financial statements that  individually and in aggregate  are not material to our financial statements taken as a whole for any related prior periods  and recorded a charge of million in the first quarter of fiscal year interest income interest income was million for fiscal year as compared to million for the prior year 
the increase is primarily related to higher balances available for investing 
sale of intellectual property rights during fiscal year  we sold certain patents and patents pending related to a legacy product line and recorded a gain of million 
the terms of the sale permit us to continue to use these patents to support our ongoing service and spare parts business included within our brooks global services segment 
sale of contract manufacturing business we closed the sale of our extended factory contract manufacturing business on june  with affiliates of celestica inc the buyers 
the gross proceeds on this transaction were million  of which million was received on the closing 
the balance of million represents a working capital normalizing adjustment  and was received during our fourth quarter of the gross proceeds include the reimbursement of million of cash on hand at the closing offset by million of transaction expenses 
the pre tax gain on the sale was million 
our income tax provision includes million of incremental taxes on this gain 
we also entered into certain commercial supply and license agreements with the buyers which will govern the ongoing relationship between the buyers and us 
pursuant to those agreements we will supply the buyers with certain products and have licensed to the buyers certain intellectual property needed to run the business and the buyers will supply certain products to us 
due to the significance of these ongoing commercial arrangements  the sale did not qualify for discontinued operations treatment 
therefore  historical financial results of the divested business will not be segregated within our consolidated financial statements for the historical periods in which this business was part of us 
loss on investment during fiscal year  we recorded a charge of million for the sale of our minority equity investment in a closely held swiss public company 
we no longer have an equity investment in this entity 
other income other income  net of million for fiscal year consists primarily of joint venture management fee income of million and million from a litigation settlement 
other income  net of million for fiscal year consists of joint venture management fee income of million which has been partially offset by foreign exchange losses of million 
income tax provision we recorded an income tax provision of million for fiscal year  which includes million of foreign and us state income taxes  and an additional million of income taxes relating to the sale of our contract manufacturing segment 
these provisions have been reduced by net favorable adjustments of million 
table of contents to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits  primarily due to the expiration of certain statutes and a favorable audit outcome 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million for fiscal year this benefit includes a million refund from the carryback of alternative minimum tax losses as a result of the worker  home ownership and business assistance act of which provides for previously of certain net operating loss carrybacks against alternative minimum taxable income 
the tax benefit for fiscal year was partially offset by us state income taxes and foreign taxes 
we continued to provide a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets at september   as we believe it is more likely than not that the future tax benefits from accumulated net operating losses and other temporary differences will not be realized 
we will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance in future periods 
if we continue to generate profits in most of our jurisdictions  it is reasonably possible that there will be a significant reduction in the valuation allowance in the next twelve months 
reduction of the valuation allowance  in whole or in part  would result in a non cash income tax benefit during the period of reduction 
of the unrecognized tax benefits of million at september   we currently anticipate that the statute of limitations is expected to lapse on various uncertain tax positions in the next twelve months and accordingly it is reasonably possible that this will result in a potential decrease of million to our unrecognized tax benefits all of which will impact net income 
equity in earnings of joint ventures income associated with our interest in ulvac cryogenics  inc  a joint venture with ulvac corporation of japan  was million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year income associated with our interest in yaskawa brooks automation  inc  a joint venture with yaskawa electric corporation of japan was million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year year ended september   compared to year ended september  revenues we reported revenues of million for fiscal year  compared to million in the previous year  a increase 
the total increase in revenues of million arose in all of our operating segments 
our brooks product solutions segment revenues increased by million  our brooks global services segment revenues increased by million and our contract manufacturing segment revenues increased by million 
these increases were primarily the result of increased volume of shipments in response to increasing demand for semiconductor capital equipment 
our brooks product solutions segment reported revenues of million for fiscal year  an increase of from million in the prior year 
these increases are primarily attributable to higher volumes of shipments to semiconductor capital equipment customers  which increased for fiscal year as compared to the prior year  and an increase of million from non semiconductor customers for fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
our brooks global services segment reported revenues of million for fiscal year  a increase from million in the prior year 
the increase includes a million increase in product revenues  which are comprised mostly of spare part sales to end users  and a million increase in revenues from services 
these increases are primarily attributable to increased demand from our semiconductor customers 
all service revenues included in our consolidated statements of operations  which include service contract and repair services  are related to our brooks global services segment 
our contract manufacturing segment reported revenues of million for fiscal year  a increase from million in the prior year 
this increase is related to increased volume of shipments in response to increased demand for semiconductor capital equipment 
revenues from the brooks product solutions segment for the fiscal years and include intercompany sales of million and million  respectively  from this segment to the contract manufacturing segment 
these intercompany revenues have been eliminated from the revenues of contract manufacturing 

table of contents revenues for the contract manufacturing segment for the fiscal years and exclude intercompany sales of million and million  respectively  from this segment to the brooks product solutions segment 
revenues outside the united states were million  or of total revenues  and million  or of total revenues  for fiscal years and  respectively 
gross margin gross margin dollars increased to million for fiscal year as compared to a loss of million in the prior year 
this increase was attributable to higher revenues of million  an asset impairment charge primarily related to intangible assets of million which reduced the prior year gross profit  a million reduction in charges for excess and obsolete inventory and million of reduced amortization expense for completed technology intangible assets 
the decrease in amortization expense is primarily the result of the impairment of these assets recorded in the second quarter of fiscal year gross margin percentage increased to for fiscal year  compared to for the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributable to higher absorption of indirect factory overhead on higher revenues 
other factors that increased gross margin percentage include decreased charges for excess and obsolete inventory which increased gross margin percentage by for fiscal year as compared to the prior year and reduced amortization expense for completed technology intangible assets which increased gross margin percentage by for fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
further  the prior year gross margin percentage was adversely impacted by asset impairment charges which reduced gross margin percentage by in fiscal year the increases in the current year gross margin percentage were partially offset by a less favorable product mix from the growth of our contract manufacturing segment  which earns margins that are below those earned by our other operating segments 
gross margin of our brooks product solutions segment increased to million for fiscal year as compared to million for the prior year 
this increase was attributable to higher revenues of million for fiscal year as compared to the prior year  reduced charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million for fiscal year as compared to the prior year and reduced amortization expense for completed technology intangible assets of million for fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
gross margin percentage for this segment was for fiscal year as compared to in the prior year 
this increase is primarily the result of higher absorption of indirect factory overhead on higher revenues

gross margin percentage for this segment increased to for fiscal year as compared to in the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to higher absorption of indirect factory overhead on higher revenues 
in addition  
table of contents decreased charges for excess and obsolete inventory led to an increase in gross margin percentage of for fiscal year as compared to the prior year and decreased amortization expense for completed technology intangible assets led to an increase in gross margin of for fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
gross margin for fiscal year was reduced by million for the impairment of certain long lived assets  including a million charge for completed technology intangible assets and million charge for property and equipment 
we did not incur any impairment charges for long lived assets in fiscal year the details of our impairment charges are discussed in greater detail under the impairment charges caption 
research and development research and development  or r d  expenses for fiscal year were million  a decrease of million  compared to million in the previous year 
this decrease is primarily related to lower labor related costs associated with headcount reductions initiated in fiscal years and our r d investments increased for each fiscal quarter throughout fiscal year  including million of r d expenses for the fourth quarter of fiscal year  as we increased our investments in certain new product programs 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses were million for fiscal year  a decrease of million compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease is primarily attributable to lower litigation costs of million 
we settled our litigation matters with the sec during fiscal  however  we continued to incur substantial litigation costs  net of insurance reimbursements  throughout fiscal year as we indemnified costs incurred by a former executive 
we did not incur substantial litigation costs in fiscal year other cost decreases in sg a include million of reduced amortization of intangible assets primarily due to the impairment of those assets recorded in the second quarter of fiscal year these costs decreases were partially offset by million of increased depreciation expense for the implementation of the oracle erp system during the latter half of fiscal year  with the balance related primarily to higher labor costs 
during fiscal year  we capitalized approximately million of internal labor costs in connection with the oracle erp system implementation 
after the implementation was complete  the labor costs for the employees previously assigned to the oracle implementation was expensed as incurred 
this decrease in capitalized labor is the primary cause of the increased labor costs in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year impairment charges we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at least annually 
we conduct this test as of september th of each fiscal year 
our test of goodwill at september  and indicated that goodwill was not impaired 
we have not tested other intangible assets since the end of the second quarter of fiscal  since no events have occurred that would require an impairment assessment 
we experienced a weakness in demand for our products from the fourth quarter of fiscal year through the second quarter of fiscal year in response to this downturn  we restructured our business  which resulted in a change to our reporting units and operating segments 
we reallocated goodwill to each of our newly formed reporting units as of march   based on such factors as the relative fair values of each reporting unit 
we reallocated goodwill to five of our seven reporting units as of march  this reallocation  in conjunction with the continued downturn in the semiconductor markets indicated that a potential impairment may exist 
as such  we tested our goodwill and other long lived assets for impairment at march  we determined the fair value of each reporting unit as of march  using the income approach  specifically the dcf method 
the material assumptions used in the dcf method include discount rates and revenue forecasts 
discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital wacc  which represents the average rate a business must pay its providers of debt and equity capital 
the wacc used to test goodwill is derived from a group of comparable companies 
the average wacc used in the march  reallocation of goodwill was 
management determines revenue forecasts based on its best estimate of near term revenue expectations which are corroborated by communications with customers  and longer term projection trends  which are validated by published independent industry analyst reports 
revenue forecasts materially impact the amount of cash flow 
table of contents generated during the five year discrete cash flow period  and also impact the terminal value as that value is derived from projected revenue 
the revenue forecasts used in the reallocation and assessment of goodwill as of march  were decreased from previously forecasted levels due to further market deterioration 
for three of the five reporting units containing goodwill at march   we determined that the carrying amount of their net assets exceeded their respective fair values  indicating that a potential impairment existed for each of those three reporting units 
after completing the required steps of the goodwill impairment test  we recorded a goodwill impairment of million as of march  under gaap  we are required to test certain long lived assets when indicators of impairment are present 
we determined that impairment indicators were present for certain of our long lived assets as of march  we tested the long lived assets in question for recoverability by comparing the sum of the undiscounted cash flows attributable to each respective asset group to their carrying amounts  and determined that the carrying amounts were not recoverable 
we then evaluated the fair values of each long lived asset of the potentially impaired long lived asset group to determine the amount of the impairment  if any 
the fair value of each intangible asset was based primarily on an income approach  which is a present value technique used to measure the fair value of future cash flows produced by the asset 
we estimated future cash flows over the remaining useful life of each intangible asset  which ranged from approximately to years  and used a discount rate of approximately 
as a result of this analysis  we determined that we had incurred an impairment loss of million as of march   and we allocated that loss among the long lived assets of the impaired asset group based on the carrying value of each asset  with no asset reduced below its respective fair value 
the impairment charge was allocated as follows million related to completed technology intangible assets  million to trade name intangible assets  million to customer relationship intangible assets and million to property  plant and equipment 
further  during the three months ended june  we recorded an additional impairment charge of million for property  plant and equipment related to the closure and outsourcing of a small manufacturing operation located in the united states 
the total impairment charges related to long lived assets for fiscal are summarized as follows in thousands year ended september  reported as cost of sales completed technology intangible asset impairment property  plant and equipment impairment subtotal  reported as cost of sales reported as operating expense trade name intangible asset impairment customer relationship intangible asset impairment subtotal  reported as operating expense restructuring charges we recorded a restructuring charge of million for fiscal year these charges include severance related costs of million  and facility related costs of million 
the severance costs primarily include adjustments for contingent severance arrangements for corporate management positions eliminated in prior periods 
the facility costs include million to amortize the deferred discount on multi year facility restructuring liabilities 
in addition  we revised the present value discounting of multi year facility related restructuring liabilities during the first quarter of fiscal year when certain accounting errors were identified in our prior period financial statements that  individually and in aggregate  are not material to our financial statements taken as a whole for any related prior periods  and recorded a charge of million in the first quarter of fiscal year we recorded charges of million for fiscal year in connection with our fiscal year restructuring plan 
these charges consisted of million of severance costs associated with workforce reductions of approximately employees in operations  service and administrative functions across all the main geographies 
table of contents in which we operate  facility closure costs of million related primarily to the closure of one manufacturing operation located in the united states  and other restructuring costs of million 
the restructuring charges by segment for fiscal were brooks product solutions million  brooks global services million and contract manufacturing million 
in addition  we incurred million of restructuring charges for fiscal that were related to general corporate functions that support all of our segments 
interest income and expense interest income was million for fiscal year as compared to million for the prior year 
the decrease is mostly due to lower interest rates on our investments 
interest expense decreased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year gain on sale of intellectual property rights during fiscal year  we sold certain patents and patents pending related to a legacy product line 
we recorded a gain of million for this sale during the second quarter of the terms of the sale permit us to continue to use these patents to support our ongoing service and spare parts business included within our brooks global services segment 
loss on investment during fiscal year  we recorded a charge of million for the sale of our minority equity investment in a closely held swiss public company 
during fiscal year  we recorded a charge of million to write down this investment to its market value 
as of september   we no longer have an equity investment in this entity 
other income other income  net of million for fiscal year consists of joint venture management fee income of million which has been partially offset by foreign exchange losses of million 
other income  net of million for fiscal year consists of management fee income of million which has been fully offset by foreign exchange losses 
income tax provision we recorded an income tax benefit of million for fiscal year this benefit includes a million refund from the carryback of alternative minimum tax losses as a result of the worker  home ownership and business assistance act of which provides for previously of certain net operating loss carrybacks against alternative minimum taxable income 
in addition  we can carryforward our remaining fiscal year alternative minimum tax net operating loss to future years to offset previously of alternative minimum taxes 
the tax benefit for fiscal year was partially offset by us state income taxes and foreign taxes 
we recorded a tax provision of million for fiscal year which was principally attributable to foreign income and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits 
we continued to provide a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets at september  and  as we believe it is more likely than not that the future tax benefits from accumulated net operating losses and deferred taxes will not be realized 
equity in earnings of joint ventures income associated with our interest in ulvac cryogenics  inc  a joint venture with ulvac corporation of japan  was million for fiscal year and the income loss associated with our interest in yaskawa brooks automation  inc  a joint venture with yaskawa electric corporation of japan was million for fiscal year as compared to million in the prior year

this cyclicality makes estimates of future revenues  results of operations and net cash flows inherently uncertain 
at september   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities aggregating million 
this amount was comprised of million of cash and cash equivalents  million of investments in short term marketable securities and million of investments in long term marketable securities 
our marketable securities are generally readily convertible to cash without an adverse impact 
cash and cash equivalents were million at september   a decrease of million from september  the significant uses of cash during fiscal year included the acquisitions of rts and nexus  which cost million  net of cash acquired  net investments in marketable securities of million  capital expenditures of million and the payment of million in dividends 
the significant sources of cash include million of cash provided by operations and million of cash generated from the sale of our contract manufacturing segment 
cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal year  and was comprised of net income of million  which includes million of non cash related charges such as million of depreciation and amortization and million of stock based compensation 
cash provided by operations was partially offset by million of increases in working capital 
increases in inventory levels were the primary contributor to increased working capital 
increases in inventory were driven by reductions in demand from our semiconductor equipment customers during our fourth quarter  along with million of increased service inventories to improve delivery and service responsiveness 
in addition  the gain of million from the sale of our contract manufacturing segment  which is included in our net income  has been removed from cash provided by operating activities since the cash flow from this transaction is considered to be an investing activity 
cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal year and was attributable to the acquisitions of rts and nexus  which cost million  net investments in marketable securities of million  capital expenditures of million and a million increase in restricted cash to support certain international letters of credit 
these uses of cash were partially offset by million of net proceeds from the sale of our contract manufacturing segment and million from the sale of other assets 
cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal year and includes million for our first quarterly cash dividend paid during the fourth quarter  which was partially offset by million of cash generated from our employee stock purchase plans 
we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future  however  the amount and timing of these dividends may be impacted by the cyclical nature of the semiconductor capital equipment market 
we may reduce  delay or cancel a quarterly cash dividend based on the severity of a cyclical downturn 
at september   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities aggregating million 
this amount was comprised of million of cash and cash equivalents  million of investments in short term marketable securities and million of investments in long term marketable securities 
cash and cash equivalents were million at september   a decrease of million from september  this decrease was primarily due to million of net purchases of marketable securities  capital expenditures of million and purchases of intangible assets of million 
these decreases were partially offset by million of cash provided by operating activities  proceeds from the sale of intellectual property of million  proceeds from the sale of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan of million and other cash items of million 
cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal year  and was comprised of net income of million  which includes million of net non cash related charges such as million of depreciation and amortization  million of stock based compensation and million of amortization of premiums paid on marketable security purchases which were partially offset by million from our gain on sale of intellectual property rights 
further  cash provided by operations was reduced by net increases in working capital of million  consisting primarily of million of increases in accounts receivable  million of increases in inventory and million of payments related to our restructuring programs implemented in prior years 
the increases in accounts receivable and inventory were caused by a increase in revenues for fiscal year as 
table of contents compared to the prior year 
these increases in working capital were partially offset by million of increases in accounts payable  million of increases in accrued warranty and retrofit costs and million of higher deferred revenues 
the increases in these liabilities are the result of increased business activities 
cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal year and was attributable to net purchases of marketable securities of million  capital expenditures of million and intangible assets of million 
these uses of cash were partially offset by million of proceeds from the sale of intellectual property rights and million of proceeds from the sale of a minority interest in a closely held swiss public company 
cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year was million  and is comprised entirely of proceeds from the sale of common stock to employees through our employee stock purchase plan 
at september   we had approximately million of letters of credit outstanding 
our contractual obligations consist of the following at september  in thousands less than one to four to total one year three years five years thereafter contractual obligations operating leases pension funding purchase commitments and other total contractual obligations as of september   the total amount of net unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and the accrual for the related interest was million  of which million represents a potential future cash outlay 
we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of the cash settlement for this liability since the timing of future tax examinations by various tax jurisdictions and the related resolution is uncertain 
in connection with our acquisition of helix technology corporation in october  we assumed the responsibility for the helix employees pension plan the helix plan 
we froze the benefit accruals and future participation in the helix plan as of october  we currently have a liability of million recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at september  related to the helix plan 
the timing of payments we make for the helix plan is impacted by a number of estimates including earnings on plan assets and the timing of future distributions 
actual results may differ from these estimates  which may materially impact the timing of future payments 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we made a voluntary contribution of million to this plan  which was in addition to the million of required minimum contributions made throughout fiscal year during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we made a voluntary contribution of million to this plan  which was in addition to the million of required minimum contributions made throughout fiscal year in connection with our acquisition of nexus  we assumed responsibility for the nexus biosystems ag pension plan the nexus plan 
the timing of payments we make for the nexus plan is impacted by a number of estimates including earnings on plan assets and the timing of future distributions 
actual results may differ from these estimates  which may materially impact the timing of future payments 
nexus prepaid contributions to the investment manager of this plan prior to the closing of the acquisition 
the investment manager draws on these prepaid contributions to fund contributions to the plan  as required 
as of september   we had million on deposit for this plan which is expected to cover contribution requirements in the near term 
in addition  we are a guarantor on a lease in mexico that expires in january the remaining payments under this lease at september  are approximately million 
on june   we filed a registration statement on form s with the sec to sell up to million of securities  before any fees or expenses of the offering

the total dividend of approximately million was paid on september  to shareholders of record at the close of business on september  on november   our board of directors approved a cash dividend of per share of the company s common stock 
the total dividend of approximately million will be paid on december  to shareholders of record at the close of business on december  dividends are declared at the discretion of our board of directors and depend on actual cash from operations  our financial condition and capital requirements and any other factors our board of directors may consider relevant 
future dividend declarations  as well as the record and payment dates for such dividends  will be determined by our board of directors on a quarterly basis 
we believe that we have adequate resources to fund our currently planned working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
the cyclical nature of our served markets and uncertainty with the current global economic environment makes it difficult for us to predict longer term liquidity requirements with certainty 
we may be unable to obtain any required additional financing on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to successfully develop or enhance products  respond to competitive pressure or take advantage of acquisition opportunities  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
other key indicators of financial condition and operating performance ebitda and adjusted ebitda presented below are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by  or presented in accordance with gaap 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measurements of our financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap 
ebitda represents net income loss before interest income  income tax provision benefit  depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda further adjusted to give effect to certain non recurring and or non cash items and other adjustments 
we believe that the inclusion of ebitda and adjusted ebitda in this form k is appropriate because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties 
we use adjusted ebitda internally as a critical measurement of operating effectiveness 
we believe ebitda and adjusted ebitda facilitates operating performance comparison from period to period and company to company by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital structures  tax positions such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment affecting relative depreciation expense 
in determining adjusted ebitda  we eliminate the impact of a number of items 
for the reasons indicated herein  you are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and whether you consider it appropriate 
in addition  in evaluating adjusted ebitda  you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the presentation of adjusted ebitda 
our presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non recurring items 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations as analytical tools  and you should not consider them in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are they do not reflect our cash expenditures for capital expenditure or contractual commitments  they do not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital requirements  other companies  including other companies in our industry  may calculate these measures differently than we do  limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of these limitations  ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business 
for these purposes  we rely on our gaap results

the increase in ebitda from fiscal to fiscal is primarily related to million increase in revenues  combined with reduced levels of operating expenses as a result of restructuring actions taken during fiscal years and based on a review of nexus inventory values performed shortly after the closing of the acquisition  we recorded a charge of million for excess and obsolete inventories 
in connection with our restructuring programs implemented in fiscal  we took a million charge for excess and obsolete inventories 
in connection with the acquisitions of rts and nexus  we allocated the purchase price to the net assets acquired based on the fair value of each asset and liability 
as part of this allocation  we valued certain inventory and deferred revenue balances above and below their pre acquisition carrying values  respectively

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable interest entities vies  which requires a qualitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in a vie  and requires ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a vie and whether an interest in a vie makes the holder the primary beneficiary of the vie 
on october  we adopted this standard  which had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting requirements of goodwill  which requires a qualitative approach to considering impairment for a reporting unit with zero or negative carrying value 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting requirements of business combinations  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity for the current and comparable reporting periods 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued updated accounting guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures that result in common fair value measurements and disclosures between gaap and international financial reporting standards 
this guidance includes amendments that clarify the intent about the application of existing fair value measurements and disclosures  and change a principle or requirement for fair value measurements or disclosures 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we do not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

under the amended guidance  a company may present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this authoritative guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholder s equity 
the amendment is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  other than a change in presentation  we do not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued new guidance intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing 
entities will be allowed to perform a qualitative assessment on goodwill impairment to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary 
this new guidance is effective for goodwill impairment tests performed in interim and annual periods beginning after december  we do not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate exposure as our cash and cash equivalents consist principally of money market securities  which are short term in nature  our exposure to market risk related to interest rate fluctuations for these investments is not significant 
our short term and long term investments consist mostly of highly rated corporate debt securities  and as such  market risk to these investments is not significant 
at september   the unrealized loss position on marketable securities was  which is included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets 
we did not have any realized losses on marketable securities for the year ended september  a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates would result in an annual change of approximately million in interest income earned 

table of contents currency rate exposure we have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros  sterling and a variety of asian currencies 
sales in currencies other than the us dollar were of our total sales for the year ended september  these foreign sales were made primarily by our foreign subsidiaries  which have cost structures that substantially align with the currency of sale 
in the normal course of our business  we have short term advances between our legal entities that are subject to foreign currency exposure 
these short term advances were approximately million at september   and relate to the euro and a variety of asian currencies 
a majority of our foreign currency loss of million for fiscal year relates to the currency fluctuation on these advances between the time the transaction occurs and the ultimate settlement of the transaction 
a hypothetical change in foreign exchange rates at september  would result in a million change in our net income loss 
we mitigate the impact of potential currency translation losses on these short term inter company advances by the timely settlement of each transaction  generally within days
