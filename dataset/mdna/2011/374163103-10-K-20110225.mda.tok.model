item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations research and development expense 
patents and proprietary technology a broad intellectual property portfolio of issued patents and pending patent applications supports our internal product development  collaborations and licensing relationships 
it is also the asset on which our out licensing activities are based 
as of december   we own or have licensed issued or allowed united states patents  granted or accepted foreign patents and patent applications that are pending around the world 
our policy is to seek appropriate patent protection for inventions in our principal technology platforms telomerase and human embryonic stem cells as well as ancillary technologies that support these platforms or otherwise provide a competitive advantage or commercial benefit to us 
we achieve this by filing patent applications for discoveries made by our scientists  as well as those that we make in conjunction with our scientific collaborators and strategic partners 
typically  although not always  we file patent applications in the united states and in major markets around the world 
we determine the jurisdictions in which to file a particular patent family based on factors including the technology involved  projected market opportunity for our products  and other relevant commercial activities in the jurisdiction in question 
a typical patent application family includes applications in the united states  canada  europe  japan  china  india  australia and south korea 
in addition  where appropriate  we obtain licenses from other organizations to patent filings that may be useful in advancing our scientific and product development programs or proprietary position in a technology 
the jurisdictions in which those in licensed patents are filed may have already been selected by the licensing organization from which we obtain the rights  often they are filed in fewer countries than our internal filings 
the development of biotechnology products  including ours  typically includes the early development of a platform technology base  followed by rounds of increasingly focused innovation around a product opportunity  including identification and definition of a specific product candidate  manufacturing processes  product formulation and administration methods 
the result of this is that biotechnology products are often protected by several families of patent filings that are filed at different times during product development and cover different aspects of the product 
consequently  earlier filed  broad technology platform patents will usually expire ahead of patents covering later developments such as product formulations  so that patent expirations on a product may span several years 
patent coverage may also vary from country to country based on the scope of available patent protection 
there are also limited opportunities to obtain extension of patent coverage for a product in certain countries  which add further complexity to the determination of patent life 
with the foregoing in mind  below we provide an overview of the patent protection for our major programs 
it is important to note that all of our product candidates are still under development  so further innovation and associated patent filings may provide additional patent coverage 
furthermore  the patent expiration ranges given are for the us only and only for patent families where patents have already issued ie  they do not account for recently filed patent families where the expiration date of patents yet to issue may be after the last expiration date given here 
the stated expiration dates also do not account for potential patent extensions that may be available 
we endeavor to monitor worldwide patent filings by third parties that are relevant to our business 
based on this monitoring  we may determine that an action is appropriate to protect our business interests 
such actions may include negotiating patent licenses where appropriate  filing oppositions or reexaminations against a patent  or filing a request for the declaration of an interference with a us patent application or issued patent 
similarly  third parties may take similar actions against our patents 
by way of example  in we were involved in interference proceedings that we had initiated at the us patent and trademark office involving patents and patent applications for nuclear transfer technology  judgments in those actions were entered in our favor 
in  we initiated a patent interference proceeding involving patent rights relating to the production of endoderm cells from hescs  and that proceeding is currently ongoing 
we are currently also involved in patent opposition proceedings before the european patent office and the australian patent office both as the party holding the opposed patent  and in opposition to patents granted or proposed to be granted to another entity 
the information provided here should be reviewed in the context of the section entitled risks related to protecting our intellectual property that begins on page telomerase our telomerase platform is the mainstay of our oncology program and serves as the basis for other product opportunities 
the table on page describes the telomerase products currently in development by geron and our partners 
as of december   our telomerase patent portfolio includes issued or allowed united states patents  granted or accepted foreign patents and patent applications pending worldwide relating to our telomerase based product opportunities 
these include patents covering the cloned genes that encode the rna component htr and the catalytic protein component htert of human telomerase 
related issued and pending patents cover cells that are immortalized by expression of recombinant htert  cancer diagnostics based on detecting the expression of telomerase in cancer cells  and telomerase inhibitors for use as cancer therapeutics 
we also own patents covering novel amidate oligonucleotide chemistry that we employ in our telomerase inhibitor program  and methods of manufacturing these oligonucleotides 
imetelstat grnl our patent rights relevant to imetelstat include those covering the nucleic acid sequence of htr on which imetelstat is based  amidate oligonucleotide chemistry employed in imetelstat  and manufacturing processes for the drug 
these patents are wholly owned by geron 
the expiration dates on these patents range from to grnvac our patent rights relevant to grnvac include those covering htert  rna pulsed dendritic cells  and the lamp sequence 
we co own the htert patents with the university of colorado and hold an exclusive license to the colorado rights 
the patents covering the rna pulsed dendritic cell technology are owned by duke university  and we hold co exclusive license right to those patents from argos  inc the patents covering the lamp sequence are owned by johns hopkins university and we hold an exclusive license under those patents to use the lamp sequence in conjunction with telomerase from immunomic therapeutics  inc the expiration dates on these patents range from to human embryonic stem cells our human embryonic stem cell hesc platform serves as the basis for the development of product candidates that are listed in the table on page as of december   our hesc patent portfolio includes issued or allowed united states patents  granted or accepted foreign patents and patent applications pending worldwide relating to our hesc based product opportunities 
this portfolio includes foundational hesc patents licensed to us exclusively and non exclusively  varying by field of use from the wisconsin alumni research foundation  or warf  and patent families exclusively licensed to us by the university of california  the university of oxford  the university of edinburgh  and the robarts research institute of the university of western ontario 
however  the majority of patent filings in this portfolio is owned by geron and covers technologies that we have developed to enable scalable manufacturing of various cell types from hescs 
by way of example  our hesc portfolio includes patents and patent applications covering technologies that we believe will facilitate the commercial scale production of hescs  such as methods for growing the cells without the need for cell feeder layers  and novel synthetic growth surfaces that we are developing in conjunction with corning life sciences 
we also own or have licensed patent rights covering cell types that can be made from hescs  including hepatocytes liver cells  cardiomyocytes heart muscle cells  neural cells nerve cells  including dopaminergic neurons and oligodendrocytes  chondrocytes cartilage cells  pancreatic islet cells  osteoblasts bone cells  hematopoietic cells blood forming cells and dendritic cells 
grnopc our patent rights relevant to grnopc include rights licensed from warf and the university of california both licensed exclusively for this product candidate  and various geron owned patent families covering the growth of hescs and their differentiation into neural cells 
the expiration dates on these patents range from to grncm our patent rights relevant to grncm include rights licensed from warf licensed exclusively for this product candidate  and various geron owned patent families covering the growth of hescs and their differentiation into cardiomyocytes 
the expiration dates on these patents range from to grnic our patent rights relevant to grnic include rights licensed from warf licensed exclusively for this product candidate  and various geron owned patent families covering the growth of hescs and their differentiation into pancreatic islet cells 
the expiration dates on these patents range from to grnchnd our patent rights relevant to grnchnd include rights licensed from warf licensed non exclusively for this product candidate and the university of edinburgh licensed exclusively  and various geron owned patent families covering the growth of hescs and their differentiation into chondrocytes 
grnvac our patent rights relevant to grnvac include rights licensed from warf licensed non exclusively for this product candidate and the university of oxford  the robarts research institute of the university of western ontario and the university of colorado all licensed exclusively for this product candidate  as well as various geron owned patent families covering the growth of hescs and their differentiation into dendritic cells 
the expiration dates on these patents range from to ge healthcare product candidates various our alliance agreement with ge healthcare includes a license grant from geron to ge healthcare under geron s hesc patents to commercialize any hesc derived cell type for drug discovery applications 
ge healthcare is focusing its product development efforts on hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes 
our patents on these particular cell types expire in the ranges of to and to  respectively 
receptor targeting peptide technology grn our patent rights relevant to grn are based on rights exclusively licensed from angiochem  inc in december as of december   these in licensed patent rights include two issued or allowed united states patents  four granted or accepted foreign patents and patent applications pending worldwide 
these patent rights cover proprietary peptides facilitating transport of therapeutic payloads across the bbb as well as patent claims to specific therapeutic compounds that employ these peptides  including grn one us patent has issued so far out of this patent group  with an expiration date of nuclear transfer viagen  inc a third technology platform  nuclear transfer  is protected by the patent rights that we purchased in with the acquisition of the uk company roslin bio med  which we now operate as geron bio med 
we license these rights to viagen  inc  in which we hold a equity stake  for use in non human animal cloning applications 
as of december   united states patents have now been issued or been allowed  and foreign patents have been granted or accepted 
in addition  we have pending patent applications worldwide relating to nuclear transfer 
the expiration dates of these patents are in competition the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive 
other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and research organizations currently engage in or have in the past engaged in efforts related to the biological mechanisms that are the focus of our programs in oncology and human embryonic stem cell therapies  including the study of telomeres  telomerase  receptor targeting peptides crossing the bbb and hescs 
we believe that the quality and breadth of our technology platforms  the skills of our employees and our ability to recruit and retain skilled employees  our patent portfolio and our capabilities for research and development are competitive strengths 
however  many large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have significantly larger intellectual property estates than we do  more substantial capital resources than we have  and greater capabilities and experience than we do in preclinical and clinical development  sales  marketing  manufacturing and regulatory affairs 
smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies 
academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research  seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research  clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours 
these companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs 
we believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend on  among other things efficacy  safety and reliability of our product candidates  timing and scope of regulatory approval  the speed at which we develop product candidates  our ability to complete preclinical testing and clinical development and obtaining regulatory approvals for product candidates  our ability to manufacture and sell commercial quantities of a product to the market  the availability of reimbursement for product use in approved indications  product acceptance by physicians and other health care providers  quality and breadth of our technology  skills of our employees and our ability to recruit and retain skilled employees  protection of our intellectual property  and availability of substantial capital resources to fund development and commercialization activities 
government regulation regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries is a significant factor in the development  manufacture and marketing of our proposed products and in our ongoing research and product development activities 
the nature and extent to which such regulation applies to us will vary depending on the nature of any products which may be developed by us 
we anticipate that many  if not all  of our proposed products will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization 
in particular  human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other approval procedures of the fda and similar regulatory authorities in european and other countries 
various governmental statutes and regulations also govern or influence testing  manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage and recordkeeping related to such products and their marketing 
the process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and money  and there can be no guarantee that approvals will be granted 
fda approval process prior to commencement of clinical studies involving humans  preclinical testing of new pharmaceutical products is generally conducted on animals in the laboratory to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product candidate 
the results of these studies are submitted to the fda as part of an ind application  which must become effective before clinical testing in humans can begin 
typically  human clinical evaluation involves a time consuming and costly three phase process 
in phase  clinical trials are conducted with a small number of people to assess safety and to evaluate the pattern of drug distribution and metabolism within the body 
in phase  clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy  optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety 
in some cases  an initial trial is conducted in diseased patients to assess both preliminary efficacy and preliminary safety and patterns of drug metabolism and distribution  in which case it is referred to as a phase trial 
in phase  large scale  multi center  comparative trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the fda 
the fda closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical testing and may  at its discretion  re evaluate  alter  suspend  or terminate the testing based upon the data which have been accumulated to that point and its assessment of the risk benefit ratio to the patient 
all adverse events must be reported to the fda 
monitoring of all aspects of the study to minimize risks is a continuing process 
the results of the preclinical and clinical testing on non biologic drugs and certain diagnostic drugs are submitted to the fda in the form of a new drug application nda for approval prior to commencement of commercial sales 
in the case of vaccines or gene and cell therapies  the results of clinical trials are submitted as a biologics license application bla 
in responding to an nda bla submission  the fda may grant marketing approval  may request additional information  may deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval  and may also refuse to review an application that has been submitted if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for filing and review 
there can be no assurance that approvals will be granted on a timely basis  if at all  for any of our proposed products 
european and other regulatory approval whether or not fda approval has been obtained  approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities in europe and other countries will be necessary prior to commencement of marketing the product in such countries 
the regulatory authorities in each country may impose their own requirements and may refuse to grant an approval  or may require additional data before granting it  even though the relevant product has been approved by the fda or another authority 
as with the fda  the regulatory authorities in the european union eu and other developed countries have lengthy approval processes for pharmaceutical products 
the process for gaining approval in particular countries varies  but generally follows a similar sequence to that described for fda approval 
in europe  the european committee for proprietary medicinal products provides a mechanism for eu member states to exchange information on all aspects of product licensing 
the eu has established a european agency for the evaluation of medical products  with both a centralized community procedure and a decentralized procedure  the latter being based on the principle of licensing within one member country followed by mutual recognition by the other member countries 
other regulations we are also subject to various us federal  state  local and international laws  regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances  including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents  used in connection with our business 
we cannot accurately predict the extent of government regulation which might result from future legislation or administrative action 
scientific consultants we have consulting agreements with a number of leading academic scientists and clinicians 
these individuals serve as key consultants or as members of clinical focus group panels with respect to our product development programs and strategies 
we use consultants to provide us with expert advice and consultation on our scientific programs and strategies  as well as on the ethical aspects of our work 
they also serve as important contacts for us throughout the broader scientific community 
they are distinguished scientists and clinicians with expertise in numerous scientific and medical fields  including embryonic stem cells  nuclear transfer and telomere and telomerase biology  developmental biology  cellular biology  molecular biology  oncology  spinal cord injury  heart disease and diabetes 
we retain each consultant according to the terms of a consulting agreement 
under such agreements  we pay them a consulting fee and reimburse them for out of pocket expenses incurred in performing their services for us 
in addition  some consultants hold options to purchase our common stock and restricted stock awards  subject to the vesting requirements contained in the consulting agreements 
our consultants may be employed by institutions other than ours  and therefore may have commitments to  or consulting or advisory agreements with  other entities or academic institutions that may limit their availability to us

we consider relations with our employees to be good 
item a 
risk factors our business is subject to various risks  including those described below 
you should carefully consider these risk factors  together with all of the other information included in this form k 
any of these risks could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
risks related to our business our business is at an early stage of development 
our business is at an early stage of development  in that we do not yet have product candidates in late stage clinical trials or on the market 
we have sponsored six phase or trials of our lead anti cancer drug candidate  imetelstat  in patients with chronic lymphoproliferative diseases  solid tumor malignancies  non small cell lung cancer  breast cancer and multiple myeloma and all of those trials have now completed patient enrollment 
we are advancing imetelstat through phase trials in four different malignancies and each of these trials is currently open for patient enrollment 
patient enrollment for the trial of our telomerase cancer vaccine  grnvac  in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia is now complete 
in october  the first patient was enrolled into the phase multi center trial that is designed to establish the safety of grnopc in patients with complete american spinal injury association asia grade a subacute thoracic spinal cord injuries 
on december   we entered into an exclusive license agreement with angiochem  inc angiochem with respect to angiochem s proprietary peptide technology that facilitates the transfer of anti cancer compounds across the blood brain barrier bbb to enable the treatment of primary brain cancers and cancers that have metastasized to the brain 
the exclusive license agreement covers angiochem s proprietary receptor targeting peptides conjugated to tubulin disassembly inhibitors  including ang now grn  a novel taxane derivative 
our ability to develop product candidates that progress to and through clinical trials is subject to our ability to  among other things succeed in our research and development efforts  select therapeutic compounds or cell therapies for development  obtain required regulatory approvals  finance  or obtain additional financing for  our clinical trials  manufacture product candidates  and collaborate successfully with clinical trial sites  academic institutions  physician investigators  clinical research organizations and other third parties 
potential lead drug compounds or other product candidates and technologies require significant preclinical and clinical testing prior to regulatory approval in the united states and other countries 
our product candidates may prove to have undesirable and unintended side effects or other characteristics adversely affecting their safety  efficacy or cost effectiveness that could prevent or limit their commercial use 
in addition  our product candidates may not prove to be more effective for treating disease or injury than current therapies 
accordingly  we may have to delay or abandon efforts to research  develop or obtain regulatory approvals to market our product candidates 
in addition  we will need to determine whether any of our potential products can be manufactured in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost 
our research and development efforts may not result in a product that can be or will be approved by regulators or marketed successfully 
competitors may have proprietary rights which prevent us from developing and marketing our products or they may sell similar  superior or lower cost products 
because of the significant scientific  regulatory and commercial milestones that must be reached for any of our development programs or product candidates to be successful  any program or product candidate may be abandoned  even after we have expended significant resources  such as our investments or prospective investments in telomerase technology  receptor targeting peptide technology to cross the bbb  hescs  imetelstat  grn formerly ang  grnvac and grnopc  which could adversely affect our business and materially and adversely affect our stock price 
the science and technology of telomere biology  telomerase  receptor targeting peptides that cross the bbb and hescs are relatively new 
further  the information we have related to the ability of grn formerly ang to penetrate brain tissue and its anti tumor activity is preliminary and based on phase clinical studies 
there is no precedent for the successful commercialization of therapeutic product candidates based on these technologies 
therefore  our development programs are particularly risky and uncertain 
in addition  we  our licensees or our collaborators must undertake significant research and development activities to develop product candidates based on these technologies  which will require additional funding and may take years to accomplish  if ever 
restrictions on the use of hescs  political commentary and the ethical and social implications of research involving hescs could prevent us from developing or gaining acceptance for commercially viable products based upon such stem cells and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
some of our most important programs involve the use of stem cells that are derived from human embryos 
the use of hescs gives rise to ethical and social issues regarding the appropriate use of these cells 
our research related to hescs may become the subject of adverse commentary or publicity  which could significantly harm the market price of our common stock 
some political and religious groups have voiced opposition to our technology and practices 
we use stem cells derived from human embryos that had been created for in vitro fertilization procedures but were no longer desired or suitable for that use and were donated with appropriate informed consent 
many research institutions  including some of our scientific collaborators  have adopted policies regarding the ethical use of human embryonic tissue 
these policies may have the effect of limiting the scope of research conducted using hescs  thereby impairing our ability to conduct research in this field 
government imposed restrictions with respect to use of embryos or hescs in research and development could have a material effect on our business  including harming our ability to establish critical partnerships and collaborations  delaying or preventing progress in our research  product development or clinical testing  and preventing commercialization of therapies derived from hescs 
these potential effects and others may result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock 
changes in governmental regulations relating to funding of stem cell research may also materially impact our product development programs and result in an increase to the volatility of the market price of our common stock 
for example  in march president obama issued executive order  entitled removing barriers to responsible scientific research involving human stem cells 
as a result  the secretary of health and human services  through the director of the national institutes of health nih  issued new guidelines relating to human stem cell research to allow federal funding for research using hescs derived from embryos created by in vitro fertilization for reproductive purposes  but are no longer needed for that purpose 
however  in august the federal district court for the district of columbia issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting federal funding for hesc research 
in september  a federal appeals court lifted the injunction 
a final ruling is expected in meanwhile  certain states are considering enacting  or already have enacted  legislation relating to stem cell research  including california  whose voters approved proposition to provide state funds for stem cell research in november in the united kingdom and other countries  the use of embryonic or fetal tissue in research including the derivation of hescs is regulated by the government  whether or not the research involves government funding 
risks related to our financial position and need for additional financing we have a history of losses and anticipate future losses  and continued losses could impair our ability to sustain operations 
we have incurred operating losses every year since our operations began in as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with our research and development activities and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
we expect to incur additional operating losses and  as our development efforts and clinical testing activities continue  our operating losses may increase in size 
substantially all of our revenues to date have been research support payments under collaboration agreements and revenues from our licensing arrangements 
we may be unsuccessful in entering into any new corporate collaboration or license agreements that result in revenues 
we do not expect that the revenues generated from these arrangements will be sufficient alone to continue or expand our research or development activities and otherwise sustain our operations 
while we receive royalty revenue from licenses  we do not currently expect to receive sufficient royalty revenues from these licenses to independently sustain our operations 
our ability to continue or expand our research and development activities and otherwise sustain our operations is dependent on our ability  alone or with others  to  among other things  manufacture and market therapeutic products 
we also expect to experience negative cash flow for the foreseeable future as we fund our operating losses and capital expenditures 
this will result in decreases in our working capital  total assets and stockholders equity  which may not be offset by future financings 
we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability 
we may not be able to generate these revenues  and we may never achieve profitability 
our failure to achieve profitability could negatively impact the market price of our common stock 
even if we do become profitable  we cannot assure you that we would be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we will need additional capital to conduct our operations and develop our product candidates  and our ability to obtain the necessary funding is uncertain 
we will require substantial capital resources in order to conduct our operations and develop our product candidates  and we cannot assure you that our existing capital resources  interest income and equipment financing arrangement will be sufficient to fund future planned operations 
the timing and degree of any future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the accuracy of the assumptions underlying our estimates for our capital needs for the fiscal year and beyond  the magnitude and scope of our research and development programs  the progress we make in our research and development programs  preclinical development and clinical trials  our ability to establish  enforce and maintain strategic arrangements for research  development  clinical testing  manufacturing and marketing  the number and type of product candidates that we pursue  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals and clearances  and the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims 
we do not have any committed sources of capital  other than our equipment financing facility 
additional financing through strategic collaborations  public or private equity financings  capital lease transactions or other financing sources may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
the receptivity of the public and private equity markets to proposed financings is substantially affected by the general economic  market and political climate and by other factors which are unpredictable and over which we have no control 
additional equity financings  if we obtain them  could result in significant dilution to our stockholders 
further  in the event that additional funds are obtained through arrangements with collaborative partners  these arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies  product candidates or proposed products that we would otherwise seek to develop and commercialize ourselves 
if sufficient capital is not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our programs  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
risks related to clinical and commercialization activities delays in the commencement of clinical testing of our current and potential product candidates could result in increased costs to us and delay our ability to generate revenues 
the commencement of clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons  including delays in demonstrating sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain regulatory clearance to commence a clinical trial  manufacturing sufficient quantities or producing drugs meeting our quality standards of a product candidate  obtaining approval of an ind application or proposed trial design from the fda  reaching agreement on acceptable terms with our collaborators on all aspects of the clinical trial  including the contract research organizations cros and the trial sites  and obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site 
in addition  clinical trials may be delayed due to insufficient patient enrollment  which is a function of many factors  including the size and nature of the patient population  the nature of the protocol  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease  and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial 
delays in commencing clinical testing of our product candidates could prevent or delay us from obtaining approval for our product candidates 
we do not have experience as a company in conducting large scale clinical trials  or in other areas required for the successful commercialization and marketing of our product candidates 
we have no experience as a company in conducting large scale  late stage clinical trials 
we cannot be certain that planned clinical trials will begin or be completed on time  if at all 
large scale trials would require either additional financial and management resources  or reliance on third party clinical investigators  cros or consultants 
relying on third party clinical investigators or cros may force us to encounter delays that are outside of our control 
any such delays could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we also do not currently have marketing and distribution capabilities for our product candidates 
developing an internal sales and distribution capability would be an expensive and time consuming process 
we may enter into agreements with third parties that would be responsible for marketing and distribution 
however  these third parties may not be capable of successfully selling any of our product candidates 
the inability to commercialize and market our product candidates could materially adversely affect our business 
obtaining regulatory approvals to market our product candidates in the united states and other countries is a costly and lengthy process and we cannot predict whether or when we will be permitted to commercialize our product candidates 
federal  state and local governments in the united states and governments in other countries have significant regulations in place that govern many of our activities and may prevent us from creating commercially viable products from our discoveries 
the regulatory process  particularly for biopharmaceutical product candidates like ours  is uncertain  can take many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
our potential product candidates will require extensive preclinical and clinical testing prior to submission of any regulatory application to commence commercial sales 
in particular  human pharmaceutical therapeutic product candidates are subject to rigorous requirements of the fda in the united states and similar health authorities in other countries in order to demonstrate safety and efficacy 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities is susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory agency approvals 
in addition  delays or rejections may be encountered as a result of changes in regulatory agency policy during the period of product development and or the period of review of any application for regulatory agency approval for a product candidate 
any product candidate that we or our collaborators develop must receive all relevant regulatory agency approvals before it may be marketed in the united states or other countries 
obtaining regulatory approval is a lengthy  expensive and uncertain process 
because certain of our product candidates involve the application of new technologies or are based upon a new therapeutic approach  they may be subject to substantial additional review by various government regulatory authorities  and  as a result  the process of obtaining regulatory approvals for them may proceed more slowly than for product candidates based upon more conventional technologies 
delays in obtaining regulatory agency approvals could significantly harm the marketing of any products that we or our collaborators develop  impose costly procedures upon our activities or the activities of our collaborators  diminish any competitive advantages that we or our collaborators may attain  or adversely affect our ability to receive royalties and generate revenues and profits 
even if we commit the necessary time and resources  the required regulatory agency approvals may not be obtained for any product candidates developed by us or in collaboration with us 
if we obtain regulatory agency approval for a new product  this approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it can be marketed that could limit the potential commercial use of the product 
failure to achieve continued compliance with government regulation over approved products could delay or halt commercialization of our products 
approved products and their manufacturers are subject to continual review  and discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or its manufacturer may result in restrictions on the product or manufacturer  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
the future sale by us or our collaborators of any commercially viable product will be subject to government regulation from several standpoints  including the processes of manufacturing  advertising and promoting  selling and marketing  labeling  and distribution 
if  and to the extent that  we are unable to comply with these regulations  our ability to earn revenues will be materially and negatively impacted 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements can result in severe civil and criminal penalties  including but not limited to recall or seizure of products  injunction against the manufacture  distribution and sales and marketing of products  and criminal prosecution 
the imposition of any of these penalties or other commercial limitations could significantly impair our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to protecting our intellectual property impairment of our intellectual property rights may adversely affect the value of our technologies and product candidates and limit our ability to pursue their development 
protection of our proprietary technology is critically important to our business 
our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and enforce our patents and maintain trade secrets  both in the united states and in other countries 
further  our patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and our patent rights may not provide proprietary protection or competitive advantages to us 
in the event that we are unsuccessful in obtaining and enforcing patents  we may not be able to further develop or commercialize our product candidates and our business would be negatively impacted 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies  including ours  are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and technical questions 
in particular  legal principles for biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents in the united states and in other countries are evolving  and the extent to which we will be able to obtain patent coverage to protect our technology  or enforce issued patents  is uncertain 
in the united states  recent court decisions in patent cases as well as proposed legislative changes to the patent system only exacerbate this uncertainty 
furthermore  significant amendments to the regulations governing the process of obtaining patents were proposed in a new rule package by the united states patent and trademark office the patent office in the proposed new rules were widely regarded as detrimental to the interests of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies 
the implementation of the rule package was blocked by a court injunction requested by a pharmaceutical company 
the patent office challenged the court decision through an appeal to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit cafc  but the appeal was dismissed in november  after the patent office changed course and rescinded the proposed new rules 
at this point we do not know whether the patent office will attempt to introduce new rules to replace those that were recently withdrawn or whether any such new rules would also be challenged 
in europe  the european patent convention prohibits the granting of european patents for inventions that concern uses of human embryos for industrial or commercial purposes 
the european patent office epo was earlier interpreting this prohibition broadly  and applying it to reject claims in any patent application that pertained to hescs 
an early patent application filed by the wisconsin alumni research foundation warf with claims covering the original isolation of hescs was appealed as a test case  and examination of other hesc patent applications was suspended while that case was heard 
in november  the epo enlarged board of appeals held that the claims in the warf application were unpatentable 
geron holds a worldwide license under this patent family  and since the decision is not subject to further appeal  this warf patent family will not afford protection to geron s hesc based product candidates in europe 
however  the reason given by the epo for the decision was narrowly focused the epo found the claims objectionable on the basis that at the time that warf filed the patent application it was necessary to use a human embryo to obtain hescs since no cell lines were available 
in contrast  the hescs that we use  and which we employed in the technologies claimed in our own european patent applications  were sourced from established hesc lines 
consequently  the decision in the warf case does not directly address the patentability of the subject matter in our filings 
the epo has recently restarted examination of hesc patent applications  but its application of the warf decision to these later filed cases is still developing 
at this time  we do not know whether or to what extent we will be able to obtain patent protection for our hesc technologies in europe 
if we are unable to protect our inventions related to hescs in europe  our business would be negatively impacted 
challenges to our patent rights can result in costly and time consuming legal proceedings that may prevent or limit development of our product candidates 
publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by at least several months and sometimes several years 
therefore  the persons or entities that we or our licensors name as inventors in our patents and patent applications may not have been the first to invent the inventions disclosed in the patent applications or patents  or the first to file patent applications for these inventions 
as a result  we may not be able to obtain patents for discoveries that we otherwise would consider patentable and that we consider to be extremely significant to our future success 
where more than one party seeks us patent protection for the same technology  the patent office may declare an interference proceeding in order to ascertain the party to which the patent should be issued 
patent interferences are typically complex  highly contested legal proceedings  subject to appeal 
they are usually expensive and prolonged  and can cause significant delay in the issuance of patents 
moreover  parties that receive an adverse decision in an interference can lose important patent rights 
our pending patent applications  or our issued patents  may be drawn into interference proceedings which may delay or prevent the issuance of patents  or result in the loss of issued patent rights 
by way of example  we are currently a party to an interference proceeding that involves patent filings for making endoderm cells from hescs 
we requested that the patent office declare this interference after novocell inc recently renamed viacyte  inc 
viacyte was granted patent claims that conflict with subject matter we filed in an earlier patent application 
a number of outcomes are possible i the claims may be awarded to viacyte  ii the claims may be awarded to geron  or iii neither party might be found to be entitled to the claims 
the decision from the patent office may also be subject to appeal 
since the interference is still ongoing  we cannot predict what the outcome will be 
outside of the united states  certain jurisdictions  such as europe  new zealand and australia  permit oppositions to be filed against the granting of patents 
because our intent is to commercialize products internationally  securing both proprietary protection and freedom to operate outside of the united states is important to our business 
we are involved in both opposing the grant of patents to others through such opposition proceedings and in defending our patent applications against oppositions filed by others 
for example  we have been involved in two patent oppositions before the epo with a danish company  pharmexa 
pharmexa which acquired the norwegian company gemvax in is developing a cancer vaccine that employs a short telomerase peptide to induce an immune response against telomerase and is conducting a phase clinical trial 
pharmexa obtained a european patent with broad claims to the use of telomerase vaccines for the treatment of cancer  and geron opposed that patent in in  the opposition division od of the epo revoked the claims originally granted to pharmexa  but permitted pharmexa to add new  narrower claims limited to five specific small peptide fragments of telomerase 
the decision was appealed to the technical board of appeals tba 
in august  the tba ruled  consistent with the decision of the od  that pharmexa was not entitled to the originally granted broad claims but was only entitled to the narrow claims limited to the five small peptides 
in late  pharmexa reported that it sold its telomerase vaccine program to a korean company  kael co 
ltd  and the continuing company now operates under the name kael gemvax 
kael gemvax was recently granted a further related european patent covering its telomerase peptide vaccine against which we have filed an opposition 
that opposition is ongoing and we cannot predict the outcome 
in parallel  pharmexa opposed a european patent held by geron  the claims of which cover many facets of human telomerase  including the use of telomerase peptides in cancer vaccines 
in june  the od of the epo revoked three of the granted claims in geron s patent  specifically the three claims covering telomerase peptide cancer vaccines 
we have appealed that decision to the tba  and that appeal is still pending 
because this appeal is ongoing  the outcome cannot be determined at this time 
we have recently been awarded a second european patent with claims to telomerase peptides  and this patent has also been opposed by kael gemvax 
we cannot predict the outcome of this opposition or any subsequent appeal of the decision in the opposition 
european opposition and appeal proceedings can take several years to reach final decision 
the oppositions discussed above reflect the complexity of the patent landscape in which we operate  and illustrate the risks and uncertainties 
we are also currently involved in other patent opposition proceedings in europe and australia 
patent opposition proceedings are not currently available in the us patent system 
legislation was previously proposed to introduce them  but so far has not been enacted into law 
however  issued us patents can be reexamined by the patent office at the request of a third party 
patents owned or licensed by geron may therefore be subject to reexamination 
as in any legal proceeding  the outcome of patent reexaminations is uncertain  and a decision adverse to our interests could result in the loss of valuable patent rights 
in july  requests were filed on behalf of the foundation for taxpayer and consumer rights now renamed as consumer watchdog for reexamination of three issued us patents owned by warf and relating to hescs 
these three patents us patent nos 
  and  which are the us equivalents of the european warf case discussed above  are licensed to geron pursuant to a january license agreement with warf 
the license agreement conveys exclusive rights to geron under the warf patents for the development and commercialization of therapeutics based on neural cells  cardiomyocytes and pancreatic islet cells  derived from hescs  as well as non exclusive rights for other product opportunities 
in october  the patent office initiated the reexamination proceedings 
after initially rejecting the patent claims  the patent office issued decisions in all three cases upholding the patentability of the claims as amended 
the decisions to uphold the  and  patents are final and not subject to further appeal 
consumer watchdog appealed the decision on the  patent 
in april  the board of patent appeals and interferences reversed the earlier decision of the patent office on the  patent 
warf will now have the opportunity to present amended claims for further examination at the patent office 
we cooperated with warf in these reexamination actions and expect that warf will continue to vigorously defend its patent position 
the final outcome of these or of any future reexamination proceedings cannot be determined at this time 
reduction or loss of claim scope in these warf embryonic stem cell patents could negatively impact geron s proprietary position in this technology 
as more groups become engaged in scientific research and product development in the areas of telomerase biology  receptor targeting peptides that cross the bbb and embryonic stem cells  the risk of our patents being challenged through patent interferences  oppositions  reexaminations  litigation or other means will likely increase 
challenges to our patents through these procedures can be extremely expensive and time consuming  even if the outcome is favorable to us 
an adverse outcome in a patent dispute could severely harm our business by causing us to lose patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction s  subjecting us to litigation  or otherwise preventing us from commercializing potential products in the relevant jurisdiction s  requiring us to obtain licenses to the disputed patents  forcing us to cease using the disputed technology  or requiring us to develop or obtain alternative technologies 
furthermore  if such challenges to our patent rights are not resolved promptly in our favor  our existing business relationships may be jeopardized and we could be delayed or prevented from entering into new collaborations or from commercializing certain products  which could materially harm our business 
if we fail to meet our obligations under license agreements  we may lose our rights to key technologies on which our business depends 
our business depends on several critical technologies that are based in part on patents licensed from third parties  including the rights we licensed from angiochem in connection with our exclusive worldwide license we entered into in december those third party license agreements impose obligations on us  such as payment obligations and obligations to diligently pursue development of commercial products under the licensed patents 
if a licensor believes that we have failed to meet our obligations under a license agreement  the licensor could seek to limit or terminate our license rights  which could lead to costly and time consuming litigation and  potentially  a loss of the licensed rights 
during the period of any such litigation our ability to carry out the development and commercialization of potential products could be significantly and negatively affected 
if our license rights were restricted or ultimately lost  our ability to continue our business based on the affected technology would be severely adversely affected 
we may be subject to litigation that will be costly to defend or pursue and uncertain in its outcome 
our business may bring us into conflict with our licensees  licensors  or others with whom we have contractual or other business relationships  or with our competitors or others whose interests differ from ours 
if we are unable to resolve those conflicts on terms that are satisfactory to all parties  we may become involved in litigation brought by or against us 
that litigation is likely to be expensive and may require a significant amount of management s time and attention  at the expense of other aspects of our business 
the outcome of litigation is always uncertain  and in some cases could include judgments against us that require us to pay damages  enjoin us from certain activities  or otherwise affect our legal or contractual rights  which could have a significant adverse effect on our business 
we may be subject to infringement claims that are costly to defend  and which may limit our ability to use disputed technologies and prevent us from pursuing research and development or commercialization of potential products 
our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing patents and the proprietary rights of others 
our technologies may infringe the patents or proprietary rights of others 
in addition  we may become aware of discoveries and technology controlled by third parties that are advantageous to our programs 
in the event our technologies infringe the rights of others or we require the use of discoveries and technology controlled by third parties  we may be prevented from pursuing research  development or commercialization of potential products or may be required to obtain licenses to those patents or other proprietary rights or develop or obtain alternative technologies 
we have obtained licenses from several universities and companies for technologies that we anticipate incorporating into our potential products  and we initiate negotiation for licenses to other technologies as the need or opportunity arises 
we may not be able to obtain a license to patented technology on commercially favorable terms  or at all 
if we do not obtain a necessary license  we may need to redesign our technologies or obtain rights to alternate technologies  the research and adoption of which could cause delays in product development 
in cases where we are unable to license necessary technologies  we could be prevented from developing certain potential products 
our failure to obtain alternative technologies or a license to any technology that we may require to research  develop or commercialize our product candidates would significantly and negatively affect our business 
much of the information and know how that is critical to our business is not patentable and we may not be able to prevent others from obtaining this information and establishing competitive enterprises 
we sometimes rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary technology  especially in circumstances in which we believe patent protection is not appropriate or available 
we attempt to protect our proprietary technology in part by confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  collaborators and contractors 
we cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached  that we would have adequate remedies for any breach  or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors  any of which would harm our business significantly 
risks related to our relationships with third parties we depend on other parties to help us develop  manufacture and test our product candidates  and our ability to develop and commercialize potential products may be impaired or delayed if collaborations are unsuccessful 
our strategy for the development  clinical testing and commercialization of our product candidates requires that we enter into collaborations with corporate partners  licensors  licensees and others 
we are dependent upon the subsequent success of these other parties in performing their respective responsibilities and the continued cooperation of our partners 
by way of examples merck is developing cancer vaccines targeted to telomerase other than dendritic cell based vaccines  sienna is developing cancer diagnostics using our telomerase technology  and ge healthcare uk limited is developing cell based assays using cells derived from our hescs 
our collaborators may not cooperate with us or perform their obligations under our agreements with them 
we cannot control the amount and timing of our collaborators resources that will be devoted to activities related to our collaborative agreements with them 
our collaborators may choose to pursue existing or alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us 
under agreements with other parties  we may rely significantly on them to  among other activities conduct research and development activities in conjunction with us  design and conduct advanced clinical trials in the event that we reach clinical trials  fund research and development activities with us  manage and license certain patent rights  pay us fees upon the achievement of milestones  and market with us any commercial products that result from our collaborations 
the development and commercialization of potential products will be delayed if collaborators or other partners fail to conduct these activities in a timely manner or at all 
in addition  our collaborators could terminate their agreements with us and we may not receive any development or milestone payments 
if we do not achieve milestones set forth in the agreements  or if our collaborators breach or terminate their collaborative agreements with us  our business may be materially harmed 
we also rely on other companies for certain process development  manufacturing or other technical scientific work  especially with respect to our imetelstat  grn formerly ang  grnvac  grnopc and grncm programs 
we have contracts with these companies that specify the work to be done and results to be achieved  but we do not have direct control over their personnel or operations 
if these companies do not perform the work which they were assigned  our ability to develop or manufacture our product candidates could be significantly harmed 
our reliance on the activities of our consultants  research institutions  and scientific contractors  whose activities are not wholly within our control  may lead to delays in development of our product candidates 
we rely extensively upon and have relationships with scientific consultants at academic and other institutions  some of whom conduct research at our request  and other consultants who assist us in formulating our research and development and clinical strategy or other matters 
these consultants are not our employees and may have commitments to  or consulting or advisory contracts with  other entities that may limit their availability to us 
we have limited control over the activities of these consultants and  except as otherwise required by our collaboration and consulting agreements  can expect only limited amounts of their time to be dedicated to our activities 
in addition  we have formed research collaborations with many academic and other research institutions throughout the world 
these research facilities may have commitments to other commercial and noncommercial entities 
we have limited control over the operations of these laboratories and can expect only limited amounts of their time to be dedicated to our research goals 
if any of these third parties are unable or refuse to contribute to projects on which we need their help  our ability to generate advances in our technologies and develop our product candidates could be significantly harmed 
risks related to competitive factors the loss of key personnel could slow our ability to conduct research and develop product candidates 
our future success depends to a significant extent on the skills  experience and efforts of our executive officers and key members of our scientific staff 
we face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical  biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  as well as academic and other research institutions 
we may be unable to retain our current personnel or attract or assimilate other highly qualified management and scientific personnel in the future on acceptable terms 
the loss of any or all of these individuals could harm our business and might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of research  development or business objectives 
our product candidates are likely to be expensive to manufacture  and they may not be profitable if we are unable to significantly reduce the costs to manufacture them 
our telomerase inhibitor compound  imetelstat  our telomerase cancer vaccine  grnvac  and our hesc based products are likely to be more expensive to manufacture than most other treatments currently on the market today  and the same is likely to be true of peptide products able to cross the bbb  including grn formerly ang 
oligonucleotides are relatively large molecules with complex chemistry  and the cost of manufacturing an oligonucleotide like imetelstat is greater than the cost of making most small molecule drugs 
our present manufacturing processes are conducted at a modest scale and we hope to substantially reduce manufacturing costs through process improvements  as well as through scale increases 
if we are not able to do so  however  and  depending on the pricing of the potential product  the profit margin on the telomerase inhibitor may be significantly less than that of most drugs on the market today 
grnvac is an autologous therapy that is produced from a patient s blood using a unique process that generates highly activated dendritic cells that contain rna coding for the protein component of telomerase 
if we are unable to scalably produce dendritic cells at a lower manufacturing cost  the cost of grnvac may reduce the affordability of the therapy for patients and reduce our potential profitability 
grn formerly ang is a novel taxane derivative that is designed to cross the bbb by receptor mediated transcytosis 
the present manufacturing processes for grn formerly ang are conducted at a small scale and we hope to substantially reduce manufacturing costs through process improvements  as well as through scale increases 
if we are not able to do so  however  and  depending on the pricing of the potential product  the profit margin on grn formerly ang may be significantly less than that of most drugs on the market today 
our manufacturing processes for differentiated cells from hescs are conducted at a small scale and at a high cost per unit measure 
the cell based therapies we are developing based on hescs will probably require large quantities of cells 
we continue to develop processes to scale up production of the cells in a cost effective way 
we may not be able to charge a high enough price for any cell therapy product we develop  even if it is safe and effective  to make a profit 
if we are unable to realize significant profits from our potential product candidates  our business would be materially harmed 
some of our competitors may develop technologies that are superior to or more cost effective than ours  which may impact the commercial viability of our technologies and which may significantly damage our ability to sustain operations 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive 
other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and research organizations currently engage in or have in the past engaged in efforts related to the biological mechanisms that are the focus of our programs in oncology and human embryonic stem cell therapies  including the study of telomeres  telomerase  receptor targeting peptides crossing the bbb and hescs 
in addition  other products and therapies that could compete directly with the product candidates that we are seeking to develop and market currently exist or are being developed by pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies and by academic and other research organizations 
many companies are developing alternative therapies to treat cancer and  in this regard  are competitors of ours 
according to public data from the fda and nih  there are more than approved anti cancer products on the market in the united states  and several thousand in clinical development 
many of the pharmaceutical companies developing and marketing these competing products including glaxosmithkline  bristol myers squibb company and novartis ag  among others have significantly greater financial resources and expertise than we do in research and development  manufacturing  preclinical and clinical testing  obtaining regulatory approvals  and marketing and distribution 
smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies 
academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research  seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research  clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours 
these companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs 
in addition to the above factors  we expect to face competition in the following areas product efficacy and safety  the timing and scope of regulatory consents  availability of resources  reimbursement coverage  price  and patent position  including potentially dominant patent positions of others 
as a result of the foregoing  our competitors may develop more effective or more affordable products  or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do 
most significantly  competitive products may render any product candidates that we develop obsolete  which would negatively impact our business and ability to sustain operations 
to be successful  our product candidates must be accepted by the health care community  which can be very slow to adopt or unreceptive to new technologies and products 
our product candidates and those developed by our collaborators  if approved for marketing  may not achieve market acceptance since hospitals  physicians  patients or the medical community in general may decide not to accept and utilize these products 
the product candidates that we are attempting to develop represent substantial departures from established treatment methods and will compete with a number of conventional drugs and therapies manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical companies 
the degree of market acceptance of any of our developed potential products will depend on a number of factors  including our establishment and demonstration to the medical community of the clinical efficacy and safety of our product candidates  our ability to create products that are superior to alternatives currently on the market  our ability to establish in the medical community the potential advantage of our treatments over alternative treatment methods  and reimbursement policies of government and third party payors 
if the health care community does not accept our potential products for any of the foregoing reasons  or for any other reason  our business would be materially harmed 
if we fail to obtain acceptable prices or adequate reimbursement for our product candidates  the use of our potential products could be severely limited 
our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates will depend significantly on our ability to obtain acceptable prices and the availability of reimbursement to the patient from third party payors 
in march  president obama signed the patient protection and affordability care act  as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively  the ppaca into law 
focused on expanding healthcare coverage to millions of uninsured americans and reducing the rate of increase in healthcare costs  the ppaca contains numerous initiatives that impact the pharmaceutical industry 
these include  among other things increasing existing price rebates in federally funded health care programs  expanding rebates  or other pharmaceutical company discounts  into new programs  imposing a new non deductible excise tax on sales of certain prescription pharmaceutical products by prescription drug manufacturers and importers  reducing incentives for employer sponsored health care  creating an independent commission to propose changes to medicare with a particular focus on the cost of biopharmaceuticals in medicare part d  providing a government run public option with biopharmaceutical price setting capabilities  allowing the secretary of health and human services to negotiate drug prices within medicare part d directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers  reducing the number of years of data exclusivity for innovative biological products potentially leading to earlier biosimilar competition  and increasing oversight by the fda of pharmaceutical research and development processes and commercialization tactics 
while the ppaca may increase the number of patients who have insurance coverage for our product candidates  its cost containment measures could also adversely affect reimbursement for our potential products 
cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any product candidate we may develop in the future 
if our potential products are not considered cost effective or if we fail to generate adequate third party reimbursement for the users of our potential products and treatments  then we may be unable to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment for potential products currently in development  which could have an adverse impact on our business 
risks related to environmental and product liability our activities involve hazardous materials  and improper handling of these materials by our employees or agents could expose us to significant legal and financial penalties 
our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals and various radioactive compounds 
as a consequence  we are subject to numerous environmental and safety laws and regulations  including those governing laboratory procedures  exposure to blood borne pathogens and the handling of biohazardous materials 
we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations and may be adversely affected by the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations 
although we believe that our safety procedures for using  handling  storing and disposing of hazardous materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated 
in the event of such an accident  state or federal authorities could curtail our use of these materials and we could be liable for any civil damages that result  the cost of which could be substantial 
further  any failure by us to control the use  disposal  removal or storage  or to adequately restrict the discharge  or assist in the clean up  of hazardous chemicals or hazardous  infectious or toxic substances could subject us to significant liabilities  including joint and several liability under certain statutes 
any such liability could exceed our resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  an accident could damage our research and manufacturing facilities and operations 
additional federal  state and local laws and regulations affecting us may be adopted in the future 
we may incur substantial costs to comply with these laws and regulations and substantial fines or penalties if we violate any of these laws or regulations  which would adversely affect our business 
we may not be able to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance on commercially reasonable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities in order to protect ourselves against product liability claims 
our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the testing  manufacturing and marketing of human therapeutic and diagnostic products 
we may become subject to product liability claims if the use of our potential products is alleged to have injured subjects or patients 
this risk exists for product candidates tested in human clinical trials as well as potential products that are sold commercially 
we currently have limited clinical trial liability insurance and we may not be able to maintain this type of insurance for any of our clinical trials 
in addition  product liability insurance is becoming increasingly expensive 
being unable to obtain or maintain product liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business 
risks related to our common stock and financial reporting our stock price has historically been very volatile 
stock prices and trading volumes for many biopharmaceutical companies fluctuate widely for a number of reasons  including factors which may be unrelated to their businesses or results of operations such as media coverage  legislative and regulatory measures and the activities of various interest groups or organizations 
this market volatility  as well as general domestic or international economic  market and political conditions  could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the return on your investment 
historically  our stock price has been extremely volatile 
between january  and december   our stock has traded as high as per share and as low as per share 
between january  and december   the price has ranged between a high of per share and a low of per share 
the significant market price fluctuations of our common stock are due to a variety of factors  including the demand in the market for our common stock  the experimental nature of our product candidates  fluctuations in our operating results  market conditions relating to the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries  announcements of technological innovations  new commercial products  or clinical progress or lack thereof by us  our collaborative partners or our competitors  announcements concerning regulatory developments  developments with respect to proprietary rights and our collaborations  comments by securities analysts  general market conditions  political developments related to hesc research  public concern with respect to our product candidates  and the issuance of common stock to partners  vendors or to investors to raise additional capital 
in addition  the stock market is subject to other factors outside our control that can cause extreme price and volume fluctuations 
in the third and fourth quarters of  as well as during  broad distress in the financial markets and the economy have resulted in greatly increased market uncertainty and instability in both us and international capital and credit markets 
these conditions  combined with volatile oil prices  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment have recently contributed to substantial market volatility  and if such market conditions persist  the price of our common stock may fluctuate or decline 
securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies  including many biotechnology companies  which experience volatility in the market price of their securities 
litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could adversely affect our business 
we were named a defendant in a purported securities class action lawsuit 
this  and potential similar or related litigation  could result in substantial damages  divert management s time and attention from our business  and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
on december   a purported securities class action complaint was filed in the us district court for the northern district of california  naming us and one of our executive officers as defendants 
the lawsuit alleged that the defendants made materially false or misleading public statements regarding our financial condition in violation of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the plaintiff sought to represent a class of investors who purchased our common stock between july  and december  and sought damages  attorney s fees and other relief 
the case was voluntarily dismissed  without prejudice  on february   which dismissal was so ordered by the court on february  as is typical in this type of litigation  it is possible that similar lawsuits may yet be filed in the same or other courts that name the same or additional defendants 
on january   a purported shareholder derivative complaint against the members of our board of directors and one of our executive officers was filed in the superior court of california for the county of san mateo 
the company is named as a nominal defendant 
the complaint  which is based on the same factual background as the dismissed class action  generally alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by misrepresenting and or failing to disclose material information regarding the company s financial condition  and seeks unspecified monetary damages and other relief 
the action was removed to the us district court for the northern district of california 
another similar derivative action was filed on february  in the superior court of california for the county of san mateo 
while a derivative action is purportedly brought on behalf of the company  such litigation  as well as similar class or derivative lawsuits that may be filed  are subject to inherent uncertainties  and will cause the company to incur costs which will depend upon many unknown factors 
monitoring and defending against legal actions is time consuming for our management and may detract from our ability to fully focus our internal resources on our business activities 
in addition  despite the availability of insurance we may incur substantial legal fees and costs in connection with the litigation 
we are not currently able to estimate the possible cost to us from these matters  as the lawsuits are currently at an early stage and we cannot be certain of how long it may take to resolve the matters 
such class and derivative litigations may be filed in the future and any decision adverse to our interests in any such lawsuit  or in similar or related litigation  could result in the payment of substantial damages by us  and could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow  results of operations and financial position 
in addition  the inherent uncertainty of the currently pending litigation could lead to more volatility in our stock price 
the sale of a substantial number of shares may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales could occur  could significantly and negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
as of december   we had  shares of common stock authorized for issuance and  shares of common stock outstanding 
in addition  as of december   we have reserved for future issuance approximately  shares of common stock for our stock plans  potential milestone payments and outstanding warrants 
in addition  we have issued common stock to certain parties  such as vendors and service providers  as payment for products and services 
under these arrangements  we typically agree to register the shares for resale soon after their issuance 
we may continue to pay for certain goods and services in this manner  which would dilute your interest in us 
also  sales of the shares issued in this manner could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
on december   we obtained a worldwide exclusive license from angiochem  inc angiochem  with the right to grant sublicenses  to angiochem s proprietary peptide technology that facilitates the transfer of anti cancer compounds across the bbb to be used with tubulin disassembly inhibitors to enable the treatment of primary brain cancers and cancers that have metastasized to the brain 
as partial consideration for the license rights  we agreed to issue to angiochem million of shares of our common stock  subject to a maximum of  shares  on or about january  based on the five day volume weighted average closing price of our common stock immediately preceding the issuance date  we issued to angiochem  shares of common stock angiochem shares on january  on january   we filed a registration statement on form s angiochem s with the securities and exchange commission covering the shares issued to angiochem which was declared effective on january  the angiochem shares were initially subject to a lock up agreement with us that expired on february  any sales by angiochem of the angiochem shares are subject to certain monthly volume restrictions 
sales of the angiochem shares could negatively impact the market price of our common stock in the future 
our undesignated preferred stock may inhibit potential acquisition bids  this may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting rights of holders of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation provides our board of directors with the authority to issue up to  shares of undesignated preferred stock and to determine or alter the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions granted to or imported upon these shares without further vote or action by our stockholders 
as of the date of this form k   shares of preferred stock have been designated series a junior participating preferred stock and the board of directors still has authority to designate and issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more classes or series 
the issuance of shares of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control transaction without further action by our stockholders 
as a result  the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected 
in addition  if we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation  dissolution or winding up  or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock  the rights of holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected 
provisions in our share purchase rights plan  charter and bylaws  and provisions of delaware law  may inhibit potential acquisition bids for us  which may prevent holders of our common stock from benefiting from what they believe may be the positive aspects of acquisitions and takeovers 
our board of directors has adopted a share purchase rights plan  commonly referred to as a poison pill 
this plan entitles existing stockholders to rights  including the right to purchase shares of common stock  in the event of an acquisition of or more of our outstanding common stock 
our share purchase rights plan could prevent stockholders from profiting from an increase in the market value of their shares as a result of a change of control of us by delaying or preventing a change of control 
in addition  our board of directors has the authority  without further action by our stockholders  to issue additional shares of common stock  and to fix the rights and preferences of one or more series of preferred stock 
in addition to our share purchase rights plan and the undesignated preferred stock  provisions of our charter documents and bylaws may make it substantially more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us and may prevent changes in our management  including provisions that prevent stockholders from taking actions by written consent  divide the board of directors into separate classes with terms of office that are structured to prevent all of the directors from being elected in any one year  and set forth procedures for nominating directors and submitting proposals for consideration at stockholders meetings 
provisions of delaware law may also inhibit potential acquisition bids for us or prevent us from engaging in business combinations 
in addition  we have severance agreements with several employees and a change of control severance plan which could require an acquiror to pay a higher price 
either collectively or individually  these provisions may prevent holders of our common stock from benefiting from what they may believe are the positive aspects of acquisitions and takeovers  including the potential realization of a higher rate of return on their investment from these types of transactions 
we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
any payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition  results of operations  capital requirements and other factors and will be at the discretion of the board of directors 
furthermore  we may incur additional indebtedness that may severely restrict or prohibit the payment of dividends 
failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act requires that we establish and maintain an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting 
our annual report on form k must contain an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that we have identified 
in addition  our independent registered public accounting firm must annually provide an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act are ongoing and also apply to future years 
we expect that our internal control over financial reporting will continue to evolve as our business develops 
although we are committed to continue to improve our internal control processes and we will continue to diligently and vigorously review our internal control over financial reporting in order to ensure compliance with section requirements  any control system  regardless of how well designed  operated and evaluated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that its objectives will be met 
therefore  we cannot be certain that in the future material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not exist or otherwise be discovered 
if material weaknesses or other significant deficiencies occur  these weaknesses or deficiencies could result in misstatements of our results of operations  restatements of our consolidated financial statements  a decline in our stock price  or other material adverse effects on our business  reputation  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity

item legal proceedings on december   a purported securities class action complaint was filed in the us district court for the northern district of california  naming us and one of our executive officers as defendants 
the lawsuit alleged that the defendants made materially false or misleading public statements regarding our financial condition in violation of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the plaintiff sought to represent a class of investors who purchased our common stock between july  and december  and sought damages  attorney s fees and other relief 
the case was voluntarily dismissed  without prejudice  on february   which dismissal was so ordered by the court on february  as is typical in this type of litigation  it is possible that similar lawsuits may yet be filed in the same or other courts that name the same or additional defendants 
on january   a purported shareholder derivative complaint against the members of our board of directors and one of our executive officers was filed in the superior court of california for the county of san mateo 
the company is named as a nominal defendant 
the complaint  which is based on the same factual background as the dismissed class action  generally alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by misrepresenting and or failing to disclose material information regarding the company s financial condition  and seeks unspecified monetary damages and other relief 
the action was removed to the us district court for the northern district of california 
another similar derivative action was filed on february  in the superior court of california for the county of san mateo 
while a derivative action is purportedly brought on behalf of the company  such litigation  as well as similar class or derivative lawsuits that may be filed  are subject to inherent uncertainties  and will cause the company to incur costs which will depend upon many unknown factors 
monitoring and defending against legal actions is time consuming for our management and may detract from our ability to fully focus our internal resources on our business activities 
in addition  despite the availability of insurance we may incur substantial legal fees and costs in connection with the litigation 
we are not currently able to estimate the possible cost to us from these matters  as the lawsuits are currently at an early stage and we cannot be certain of how long it may take to resolve the matters 
such class and derivative litigations may be filed in the future and any decision adverse to our interests in any such lawsuit  or in similar or related litigation  could result in the payment of substantial damages by us  and could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow  results of operations and financial position

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as defined below 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
specifically  critical accounting estimates have the following attributes i we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and ii different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that our consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and meaningfully present our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition since our inception  a substantial portion of our revenues has been generated from research and licensing agreements 
revenue under such agreements typically includes upfront signing or license fees  cost reimbursements  milestone payments and royalties on future product sales 
we recognize nonrefundable signing  license or non exclusive option fees as revenue when rights to use the intellectual property related to the license have been delivered and over the term of the agreement if we have continuing performance obligations 
we recognize milestone payments  which are subject to substantive contingencies  upon completion of specified milestones  which represents the culmination of an earnings process  according to contract terms 
royalties are generally recognized as revenue upon the receipt of the related royalty payment 
we recognize cost reimbursement revenue under collaborative agreements as the related research and development costs for services are rendered 
we recognize related party revenue under collaborative agreements as the related party research and development costs for services are rendered and when the source of funds have not been derived from our contributions to the related party 
deferred revenue represents the portion of research or license payments received which have not been earned 
when payments are received in equity securities  we do not recognize any revenue unless such securities are determined to be realizable in cash 
we estimate the projected future term of license agreements over which we recognize revenue 
our estimates are based on contractual terms  historical experience and general industry practice 
revisions in the estimated terms of these license agreements have the effect of increasing or decreasing license fee revenue in the period of revision 
as of december   no revisions to the estimated future terms of license agreements have been made and we do not expect revisions to the currently active agreements in the future 
valuation of stock based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based awards to our employees and directors  including stock options  restricted stock awards and employee stock purchases related to our employee stock purchase plan espp based on estimated fair values 
we use the black scholes option pricing valuation model to estimate the grant date fair value of our stock options and employee stock plan purchases 
option pricing model assumptions such as expected volatility  risk free interest rate and expected term impact the fair value estimate 
further  the estimated forfeiture rate impacts the amount of aggregate compensation recognized during the period 
the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchases is amortized over the vesting period of the awards using a straight line method 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of our stock since traded options on geron stock do not correspond to option terms and trading volume of options is limited 
the expected term of options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
in deriving this assumption  we reviewed actual historical exercise and cancellation data and the remaining outstanding options not yet exercised or cancelled 
the expected term of employees purchase rights  under our espp  is equal to the purchase period 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us zero coupon treasury strip yields for the expected term in effect on the date of grant 
forfeiture rate was estimated based on historical experience and will be adjusted over the requisite service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from their estimate 
we grant restricted stock awards to employees and non employee directors with three types of vesting schedules i service based  ii performance based or iii market based 
service based awards generally vest annually over four years 
performance based stock awards psas vest only upon achievement of discrete strategic goals within a specified performance period  generally three years 
market based stock awards msas vest only upon achievement of certain market price thresholds of our common stock within a specified performance period  generally three years 
the fair value for service based restricted stock awards is determined using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant and reduced for estimated forfeitures  as applicable 
the fair value is amortized as compensation expense over the requisite service period of the award on a straight line basis 
the fair value for psas is determined using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant and reduced for estimated forfeitures  as applicable 
compensation expense for psas is recognized over the period from the date the performance condition is determined to be probable of occurring through the date the applicable condition is expected to be met 
if the performance condition is not considered probable of being achieved  no expense is recognized until such time as the performance condition is considered probable of being met  if ever 
we evaluate whether performance conditions are probable of occurring  as well as the expected performance period  on a quarterly basis 
the fair value for msas is determined using a lattice valuation model with a monte carlo simulation 
the model takes into consideration the historical volatility of our stock and the risk free interest rate at the date of grant 
in addition  the model is used to estimate the derived service period for the msas 
the derived service period is the estimated period of time that would be required to satisfy the market condition  assuming the market condition will be satisfied 
compensation expense is recognized over the derived service period for the msas using the straight line method  but is accelerated if the market condition is achieved earlier than estimated 
we annually evaluate the assumptions used in estimating fair values of our stock based awards by reviewing current trends in comparison to historical data 
we have not revised the methods by which we derive assumptions in order to estimate fair values of our stock based awards 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in future periods  the stock based compensation expense that we record for awards to employees and directors may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
non cash compensation expense recognized for stock based awards to employees and directors was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   total compensation cost related to unvested stock awards not yet recognized  net of estimated forfeitures and assuming no probability of achievement for outstanding psas  was million  which is expected to be recognized over the next months on a weighted average basis 
for our non employee stock based awards  the measurement date on which the fair value of the stock based award is calculated is equal to the earlier of i the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instrument is reached or ii the date at which the counterparty s performance is complete 
we recognized non cash stock based compensation expense of   and zero for the fair value of the vested portion of non employee options  restricted stock awards and warrants in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and  respectively 
fair value of financial instruments we categorize assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet based upon the level of judgment associated with inputs used to measure their fair value 
the categories are as follows level inputs are unadjusted  quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date 
an active market for the asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis 
level inputs other than quoted market prices included in level are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument s anticipated life 
level inputs reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model 
a financial instrument s categorization is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet  including the category for such instruments 
we classify inputs to derive fair values for marketable debt securities available for sale and marketable investments in licensees as level and instruments classified as level include money market funds  certificates of deposit and publicly traded equity securities in active markets  representing of total financial assets measured at fair value as of december  instruments classified as level include us government sponsored enterprise securities  municipal securities  commercial paper and corporate notes  representing of total financial assets measured at fair value as of december  the price for each security at the measurement date is derived from various sources 
periodically  we assess the reasonableness of these sourced prices by comparing them to the prices provided by our portfolio managers from broker quotes 
historically  we have not experienced significant deviation between the sourced prices and our portfolio manager s prices 
warrants to purchase common stock and non employee options are normally traded less actively  have trade activity that is one way  and or traded in less developed markets and are therefore valued based upon models with significant unobservable market parameters  resulting in level categorization 
the fair value for these instruments is calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the model s inputs reflect assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the instrument in a current period transaction 
inputs to the model include stock volatility  dividend yields  expected term of the derivatives and risk free interest rates 
see the following discussion  fair value of derivatives  for information on derivation of inputs to the model 
changes to the model s inputs are not changes to valuation methodologies  but instead reflect direct or indirect impacts from changes in market conditions 
accordingly  results from the valuation model in one period may not be indicative of future period measurements 
instruments classified as level include derivative liabilities  representing all of total financial liabilities measured at fair value as of december  for a further discussion regarding fair value measurements  see note on fair value measurements in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
fair value of derivatives for warrants and non employee options classified as assets or liabilities  the fair value of these instruments is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at inception of such classification and marked to fair value at each financial reporting date 
the change in fair value of the warrants and non employee options is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as an unrealized gain loss on fair value of derivatives 
the warrants and non employee options continue to be reported as an asset or liability until such time as the instruments are exercised or expire or are otherwise modified to remove the provisions which require this treatment  at which time these instruments are marked to fair value and reclassified from assets or liabilities to stockholders equity 
for warrants and non employee options classified as permanent equity  the fair value of the warrants and non employee options is recorded in stockholders equity and no further adjustments are made 
fair value of warrants and non employee options is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
use of this model requires us to make assumptions regarding stock volatility  dividend yields  expected term of the warrants and non employee options and risk free interest rates 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of our stock 
the expected term of warrants and non employee options represent the remaining contractual term of the instruments 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us zero coupon treasury strip yields for the remaining term of the instrument 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in future periods  the fair value of these warrants and non employee options reflected as of each balance sheet date and the resulting change in fair value that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in previous periods 
as of december   we have not revised the method in which we derive assumptions in order to estimate fair values of warrants and non employee options classified as assets or liabilities  and we do not expect revisions in the future 
consolidation and accounting for variable interest entities vies under applicable accounting guidance  an entity is considered to be a vie if it has one of the following characteristics i the entity is thinly capitalized  ii residual equity holders do not control the entity  iii equity holders are shielded from economic losses or do not participate fully in the entity s residual economics  or iv the entity was established with non substantive voting 
investors that finance a vie through debt or equity interests are variable interest holders in the entity 
since january   the variable interest holder  if any  exposed to the majority of the risks and rewards associated with a vie is considered the vie s primary beneficiary and must consolidate the entity 
we must evaluate our involvement in a vie and understand the purpose and design of the entity  the role we have in the entity s design and our involvement in its ongoing activities 
we then must evaluate which activities most significantly impact the economic performance of the vie and who has the power to direct such activities 
this evaluation involves a variety of qualitative and quantitative assumptions 
when we determine that we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact a vie s economic performance  we then must evaluate our economic interests  if any  and determine whether we could absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie 
when evaluating whether we have an obligation to absorb losses that could be potentially significant  we consider the maximum exposure to such loss without consideration of probability 
such obligations could be in various forms  including but not limited to  debt and equity investments  guarantees  liquidity agreements and certain derivative contracts 
as certain events occur  we reconsider which parties will absorb variability and whether we have become or are no longer the primary beneficiary 
the consolidation status of a vie may change as a result of such reconsideration events  which occur when vies acquire additional assets  issue new variable interests or enter into new or modified contractual arrangements 
a reconsideration event may also occur when we acquire new or additional interests in a vie 
for a further discussion regarding vies  see note on joint venture and related party transactions in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
results of operations our results of operations have fluctuated from period to period and may continue to fluctuate in the future  based upon the progress of our research and development efforts and variations in the level of expenses related to developmental efforts during any given period 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to results of operations for any other period 
in addition  historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results 
we are subject to risks common to companies in our industry and at our stage of development  including risks inherent in our research and development efforts  reliance upon our collaborative partners  enforcement of our patent and proprietary rights  need for future capital  potential competition and uncertainty of preclinical and clinical trial results or regulatory approvals or clearances 
in order for a product candidate to be commercialized based on our research  we and our collaborators must conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate the efficacy and safety of our product candidates  obtain regulatory approvals or clearances and enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  as well as obtain market acceptance

we recognized royalty revenues of   and  in  and  respectively  on product sales of telomerase detection and telomere measurement kits to the research use only market  cell based research products and agricultural products 
license and royalty revenues are dependent upon additional agreements being signed and future product sales 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in compared to was primarily the net result of higher drug product purchases for imetelstat of million  increased clinical trial costs of million as a result of opening four phase oncology clinical trials with imetelstat in multiple sites in the us and europe and re initiation of our phase clinical trial with grnopc for acute spinal cord injury and higher non cash compensation expense in connection with equity based awards of million  partially offset by reduced contract manufacturing costs of million primarily resulting from completion of patient enrollment in our phase trial of grnvac the increase in compared to was primarily the result of higher personnel related costs of million in connection with additional clinical operations personnel and increased clinical trial costs of  as a result of increased patient enrollment for our phase imetelstat and phase grnvac trials 
overall  we expect research and development expenses to increase as we incur expenses related to clinical trials for imetelstat and grnopc along with continued development of our human embryonic stem cell hesc programs and clinical development of our newly in licensed product candidate  grn our oncology programs focus on treating or diagnosing cancer by targeting or detecting the presence of telomerase  either inhibiting activity of the telomerase enzyme  diagnosing cancer by detecting the presence of telomerase  or using telomerase as a target for therapeutic vaccines 
our core knowledge base in telomerase and telomere biology supports all these approaches  and our scientists may contribute to any or all of these programs in a given period 
we have recently in licensed receptor targeting peptide technology to develop therapeutic compounds that can cross the bbb by targeting a natural receptor based mechanism normally used by essential substances to enter the brain  thereby allowing treatment of tumors in the brain  including primary brain cancers and metastases 
the following table briefly describes our cancer therapeutic product candidates and their stage of development product patient product description disease treatment development stage enrollment status imetelstat telomerase inhibitor non small cell lung phase trial open grnl cancer nsclc breast cancer phase trial open multiple myeloma phase trial open essential phase trial open thrombocythemia grnvac telomerase cancer acute myelogenous phase trial completed vaccine leukemia grn peptide conjugated brain metastases phase trial planned to open in paclitaxel breast cancer second half of nsclc glioblastoma phase trial planned to open in multiforme we sponsored six phase clinical trials at us medical centers treating over patients to examine the safety  tolerability  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of imetelstat  alone or in combination with other standard therapies in patients with chronic lymphoproliferative diseases  solid tumors  multiple myeloma  non small cell lung and breast cancer 
these trials have completed patient enrollment 
having met our main objectives for phase of assessing the safety  tolerability  pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of imetelstat  we are advancing the product candidate to phase clinical trials in four different malignancies  including two large randomized studies and two single arm studies 
in july  we initiated a randomized phase clinical trial of imetelstat as maintenance therapy following platinum based induction therapy for patients with nsclc 
in december  we initiated a randomized phase clinical trial of imetelstat in combination with paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer 
in the same month  we opened to enrollment a single arm phase trial in patients with previously treated multiple myeloma and a single arm phase trial in patients with essential thrombocythemia et 
importantly  the phase trials of imetelstat are all in malignancies in which cancer stem cells are believed to play an important role in disease progression or relapse after standard therapy 
a geron sponsored phase clinical trial of grnvac was conducted at six us medical centers in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia aml in complete clinical remission and examined the safety and feasibility of a prime boost vaccination regimen to extend the duration of telomerase immunity 
we also evaluated the immune response to grnvac and explored the effects of vaccination on minimal residual disease and relapse rates 
this trial completed patient enrollment in december twenty three patients in the study received vaccination with grnvac recent data from the trial showed that grnvac was safe and generally well tolerated over multiple vaccinations 
thirteen out of patients in the trial remained in clinical remission 
at months after vaccination with grnvac  estimated disease free survival was for patients at high risk of relapse ci 
previously published data on this patient population suggests that approximately of patients would normally remain free from relapse at this stage 
on december   we and angiochem  inc angiochem entered into an exclusive license agreement that provides us with a worldwide exclusive license  with the right to grant sublicenses  to angiochem s proprietary peptide technology that facilitates the transfer of anti cancer compounds across the bbb to be used with tubulin disassembly inhibitors to enable the treatment of primary brain cancers and cancers that have metastasized to the brain 
we acquired the license rights for angiochem s proprietary receptor targeting peptides for the clinical development of ang now grn  a novel taxane derivative for which angiochem has performed two phase clinical studies in brain metastases and glioblastoma multiforme 
we plan to further develop grn in phase clinical studies for these indications 
our hesc therapy programs focus on treating injuries and degenerative diseases with cell therapies based on cells derived from hescs 
a core of knowledge of hesc biology  as well as a significant continuing effort in deriving  growing  maintaining  and differentiating hescs  underlies all aspects of this group of programs 
many of our researchers are allocated to more than one hesc program  and the percentage allocations of time change as the resource needs of individual programs vary 
the following table briefly describes the hesc derived product candidates being developed by us or our collaborators and the stage of development of these product candidates patient development enrollment product product description disease treatment stage status grnopc oligodendrocytes spinal cord injury phase trial open other cns indications research n a grncm cardiomyocytes heart disease preclinical n a grnic islets type diabetes research n a grnchnd chondrocytes osteoarthritis research n a grnvac mature dendritic cells cancer immunotherapy product research n a immature dendritic cells immune rejection research n a cns indications being explored include multiple sclerosis  alzheimer s disease and leukodystrophies 
we have developed proprietary methods to grow  maintain  and scale the culture of undifferentiated hescs that use feeder cell free and serum free media with chemically defined components 
moreover  we have developed scalable processes to differentiate these cells into therapeutically relevant cells 
we have developed cryopreserved formulations of hesc derived cells to enable our business model of delivering on demand cells for therapeutic use 
we initiated the phase clinical trial of grnopc in patients with spinal cord injury with the first subject receiving cells in october this is the first fda approved clinical trial of a cellular therapy derived from hescs to be initiated 
the clinical trial is a phase multi center study designed to assess the safety and tolerability of grnopc in patients with complete asia american spinal injury association impairment scale grade a thoracic spinal cord injuries 
two clinical sites were opened in for patient enrollment 
research and development expenses incurred under each of these programs are as follows in thousands year ended december  oncology    hesc therapies    total    at this time  we cannot provide reliable estimates of how much time or investment will be necessary to commercialize products from the programs currently in progress 
drug development in the united states is a process that includes multiple steps defined by the fda under applicable statutes  regulations and guidance documents 
after the preclinical research process of identifying  selecting and testing in animals a potential pharmaceutical compound  the clinical development process begins with the filing of an investigational new drug ind application 
clinical development typically involves three phases of trials phase  and the most significant costs associated with clinical development are incurred in phase trials  which tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
after the completion of a successful preclinical and clinical development program  a new drug application nda or biologics license application bla must be filed with the fda  which includes  among other things  substantial amounts of preclinical and clinical data and results and manufacturing related information necessary to support requested approval of the product 
the nda or bla must be reviewed and approved by the fda 
according to industry statistics  it generally takes to years to research  develop and bring to market a new prescription medicine in the united states 
in light of the steps and complexities involved  the successful development of our potential products is highly uncertain 
actual timelines and costs to develop and commercialize a product are subject to enormous variability and are very difficult to predict 
in addition  various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety reporting  labeling  storage  record keeping and marketing of each product 
the lengthy process of seeking these regulatory reviews and approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business 
in responding to an nda or bla submission  the fda may grant marketing approval  may request additional information  may deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval  and may also refuse to review an application that has been submitted if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for filing and review 
we cannot provide assurance that any approval required by the fda will be obtained on a timely basis  if at all 
for a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing development of potential products  see the sub section titled delays in the commencement of clinical testing of our current and potential product candidates could result in increased costs to us and delay our ability to generate revenues and obtaining regulatory approvals to market our product candidates in the united states and other countries is a costly and lengthy process and we cannot predict whether or when we will be permitted to commercialize our product candidates in part i  item a entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
acquired in process research and development as consideration for the license rights to angiochem s proprietary peptide technology for the clinical development of ang now grn  we paid angiochem an upfront payment of million in cash and agreed to issue to angiochem million of shares of our common stock on or about january  the number of shares of common stock we actually issued to angiochem was based on the five day volume weighted average closing price of our common stock immediately preceding the issuance date 
on january   we issued to angiochem  shares 
further clinical and process development of grn is required before any viable commercial application can be identified or utilized 
we have concluded that this technology has no alternative future use  and accordingly  expensed the total upfront payment of million in connection with the license agreement as acquired in process research and development expense at the time of acquisition 
see note on license agreements in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for further discussion of the exclusive license agreement with angiochem 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in from was primarily due to higher non cash compensation expense of million related to stock options and restricted stock awards to employees  increased consulting and legal costs of  and higher costs associated with managing our intellectual property portfolio of  the decrease in from was primarily due to lower non cash compensation expense of  related to stock options and restricted stock awards to employees  reduced legal costs associated with managing our intellectual property portfolio of  and lower consulting costs of  unrealized gain on fair value of derivatives unrealized gain on fair value of derivatives reflects a non cash adjustment for changes in fair value of warrants to purchase common stock and options held by non employees that are classified as current liabilities 
derivatives classified as assets or liabilities are marked to fair value at each financial reporting date with any resulting unrealized gain loss recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
the derivatives continue to be reported as an asset or liability until such time as the instruments are exercised or expire or are otherwise modified to remove the provisions which require them to be recorded as assets or liabilities  at which time these instruments are marked to fair value and reclassified from assets or liabilities to stockholders equity 
we incurred unrealized gains of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the unrealized gains on derivatives for  and primarily reflect reduced fair values of derivative liabilities resulting from shortening of their contractual terms  decreases in the market value of our stock and changes in other inputs factored into the estimate of their fair value such as the volatility of our stock 
see note on fair value measurements in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for further discussion of the fair value of derivatives 
interest and other income interest income was  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in compared to was primarily the result of lower investment balances and declining interest rates during the majority of the decrease in compared to was primarily due to declining interest rates 
interest earned in future periods will depend on the size of our securities portfolio and prevailing interest rates 
other income was million   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in november  geron received a total of million in grants under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project qtdp program 
the maximum grant amount was awarded to each of the five geron programs that were eligible for qtdp funding and included oncology and human embryonic stem cell projects 
other income in and primarily represented tax refunds for certain research tax credits under the housing assistance tax act of resulting from our election to forego bonus depreciation with respect to investments in bonus eligible property during and losses recognized under equity method investment in august  we exchanged our equity interest in the start licensing  inc start joint venture for equity interest in viagen  inc viagen 
in september  we provided a loan of million to viagen in connection with viagen s acquisition of an interest in an unrelated company 
the proceeds of the loan did not fund prior viagen losses and represented additional financial support to viagen 
in september  we provided million as a new equity investment in viagen and also received million from viagen in repayment of our loan  resulting in a net investment of million 
the new investment in did not fund prior viagen losses and represented additional financial support to viagen 
in accordance with the equity method of accounting  we recognized losses of million  million and  for  and  respectively  for our proportionate share of viagen s losses since providing the loan in september previously  we had suspended the equity method of accounting for start and viagen since our proportionate share of net losses exceeded the value of our investment 
in november  we provided a new loan of million to viagen to fund its operations 
the loan represented additional financial support to viagen and funded approximately  in prior losses of the company which has also been included in losses recognized under equity method investment 
since viagen does not have sufficient equity to finance its own activities without additional subordinated financial support  it meets the definition of a variable interest entity vie 
by providing financial support to viagen  we are a variable interest holder 
however  the party holding the majority of the equity and debt of viagen maintains controlling financial interest over the company and we do not have power to direct the activities of viagen 
accordingly  we are not the primary beneficiary and have not included viagen financial information with our consolidated results 
see note on joint venture and related party transactions in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for further discussion of viagen 
interest and other expense interest and other expense is primarily comprised of bank charges and was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in interest and other expense for compared to was primarily due to reduced bank charges as a result of lower cash and investment balances for the majority of the increase in interest and other expense for compared to was primarily due to higher bank charges as a result of higher cash and investment balances 
deemed dividend on derivatives in april  we modified the terms of certain outstanding warrants held by an investor by extending the exercise term and  for certain of these warrants  reducing the exercise price 
in connection with the modifications  we recognized a deemed dividend of approximately  in the consolidated statements of operations for the incremental fair value of the modified warrants  as calculated using the black scholes option pricing model as of the modification date 
net loss applicable to common stockholders net loss applicable to common stockholders was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
overall net loss for increased compared to primarily due to increased research and development expenses and acquired in process research and development expense 
overall net loss for increased compared to primarily due to decreased interest income  reduced revenues from milestones  increased research and development expenses and increased losses recognized for an equity method investment 
liquidity and capital resources cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  were million  compared to million at december  and million at december  we have an investment policy to invest these funds in liquid  investment grade securities  such as interest bearing money market funds  certificates of deposit  municipal securities  us government and agency securities  corporate notes  commercial paper and asset backed securities 
our investment portfolio does not contain securities with exposure to sub prime mortgages  collateralized debt obligations or auction rate securities and  to date  we have not recognized an other than temporary impairment on our marketable securities or any significant changes in aggregate fair value that would impact our cash resources or liquidity 
to date  we have not experienced lack of access to our invested cash and cash equivalents  however  we cannot provide assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
the increase in cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in was the net result of the receipt of million in net proceeds in december from an underwritten public offering of our common stock and the receipt of million in net proceeds in january from the sale of shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase additional shares of our common stock to institutional investors  partially offset by the use of cash for operations 
the increase in cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in was the net result of the receipt of million in net proceeds in february from an underwritten public offering of our common stock and receipt of net proceeds of million from the sale of our common stock and warrants to purchase additional shares of common stock to certain institutional investors  partially offset by use of cash for operations 
we estimate that our existing capital resources  interest income and equipment financing facility will be sufficient to fund our current level of operations through at least december however  our future capital requirements will be substantial 
changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses or cash balances may result in the expenditure of available resources before such time 
factors that may require us to use our available capital resources sooner than we anticipate include continued clinical development of our product candidates  imetelstat  grn and grnopc  our ability to meaningfully reduce manufacturing costs of current product candidates  future clinical trial results  progress of product and preclinical development of our other product candidates  such as grncm  grnic and grnchnd  cost and timing of regulatory approvals  and filing  maintenance  prosecution  defense and enforcement of patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
if our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations 
we anticipate that we would need to seek additional funding through strategic collaborations  public or private equity financings  equipment loans or other financing sources that may be available 
however  we may be unable to raise sufficient additional capital when we need it  on favorable terms or at all 
if we are unable to obtain adequate funds on reasonable terms  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or obtain funds by entering into financing  supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms or we may be required to relinquish rights to technology or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that are unfavorable to us 
cash flows from operating activities net cash used in operations was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in net cash used for operations in compared to and compared to was primarily the result of increased research and development expenses associated with our clinical operations and reduced interest income 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million and million for and  respectively 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in the decrease in net cash used in investing activities in compared to was primarily the result of lower purchases of marketable securities and higher marketable securities maturities 
the decrease in cash provided by investing activities in compared to primarily reflected increased marketable securities purchases  partially offset by higher marketable securities maturities 
for the three years ended december   we have purchased approximately million in property and equipment  net of disposals  none of which was financed through equipment financing arrangements 
as of december   no payments were due under our equipment financing facility 
as of december   we had approximately  available for borrowing under our equipment financing facility 
if we are unable to renew the commitment  we will use our cash resources for capital expenditures 
cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities in and was million and million  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities in was  net cash provided by financing activities in primarily reflected receipt of approximately million in net proceeds from an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses and the receipt of approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock to certain institutional investors in connection with the exchange of warrants held by those investors for shares of our common stock 
net cash provided by financing activities in primarily reflected receipt of approximately million in net proceeds from an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses and receipt of net proceeds of million from the sale of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock with an exercise price of per share to certain institutional investors 
net cash used in financing activities in primarily reflected the repurchase of vested stock from certain employees to provide funds for minimum payroll tax withholding requirements 
contractual obligations as of december  our contractual obligations for the next five years  and thereafter were as follows principal payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands equipment lease operating leases research funding    total contractual cash obligations   this table does not include any milestone payments under research collaborations or license agreements as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known 
in addition  this table does not include payments under our severance plan if there were a change in control of the company or severance payments to key employees under involuntary termination 
in march  we issued  shares of our common stock to the lessor of our premises at and constitution drive in payment of our monthly rental obligation from august  through july  in may  we issued  shares of our common stock to the lessor of our premises at commonwealth drive in payment of our monthly rental obligation from may  through april  in january  we extended the lease at our premises at commonwealth drive 
in january and april  we issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to the lessor of those premises in payment of our monthly rental obligation from may  through july  the fair value of the common stock issuances has been recorded as a prepaid asset and is being amortized to rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease periods 
future minimum payments under non cancelable operating leases are zero through july   as a result of the prepayments of rent with our common stock 
research funding is comprised of sponsored research commitments at various laboratories around the world

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures contains forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
credit risk 
we place our cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities with six financial institutions in the united states and scotland 
deposits with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits 
while we monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate  these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and marketable securities 
cash equivalents and marketable securities currently consist of money market funds  certificates of deposit  municipal securities  us government sponsored enterprise securities  commercial paper and corporate notes 
our investment policy  approved by our board of directors  limits the amount we may invest in any one type of investment issuer  thereby reducing credit risk concentrations 
we limit our credit and liquidity risks through our investment policy and through regular reviews of our portfolio against our policy 
to date  we have not experienced any loss or lack of access to cash in our operating accounts or to our cash equivalents and marketable securities in our investment portfolios 
interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to manage our marketable securities portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in widely diversified investments consisting of both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments  which both carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future interest income may fall short of expectations due to changes in market conditions and in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which may have declined in fair value due to changes in interest rates 
the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  was million 
these investments include million of cash equivalents which are due in less than days  million of short term investments which are due in less than one year and million of long term investments which are due in one to two years 
we primarily invest our marketable securities portfolio in securities with at least an investment grade rating to minimize interest rate and credit risk as well as to provide for an immediate source of funds 
although changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments are sold 
due to the nature of our investments  which are primarily money market funds  certificates of deposit  municipal securities  us government sponsored enterprise securities  commercial paper and corporate notes  we have concluded that there is no material interest rate risk exposure 
foreign currency exchange risk 
because we translate foreign currencies into us dollars for reporting purposes  currency fluctuations can have an impact  though generally immaterial  on our operating results 
we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is insignificant primarily because our wholly owned international subsidiary  geron bio med ltd  satisfies its financial obligations almost exclusively in its local currency 
as of december   there was an immaterial currency exchange impact from our intercompany transactions 
as of december   we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
