dollar amounts are in thousands  except share and per share data and as indicated 
the purpose of this discussion and analysis is to enhance the understanding and evaluation of the results of operations  financial position  cash flows  indebtedness  and other key financial information of joy global inc and its subsidiaries for   and for a more complete understanding of this discussion  please read the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
overview we have been manufacturing mining equipment for over years 
we operate in two business segments underground mining machinery  comprised of our joy mining machinery business and surface mining equipment  comprised of our p h mining equipment business 
joy is a leading producer of high productivity underground mining machinery for the extraction of coal and other bedded materials 
p h is the world s largest producer of high productivity electric mining shovels and a major producer of rotary blasthole drills  walking draglines and large wheel loaders used primarily for surface mining of copper  coal  iron ore  oil sands  and other minerals 
in addition to selling original equipment  we provide parts  components  repairs  rebuilds  diagnostic analysis  training  and other aftermarket services for our installed base of machines 
in the case of surface mining equipment  we also provide aftermarket services for equipment manufactured by other companies  including manufacturers with which we have ongoing relationships and which we refer to as alliance partners 
we emphasize our aftermarket products and services as an integral part of lowering our customers cost per unit of production and are focused on continuing to grow this part of our business 
letourneau technologies  inc on june  we acquired letourneau technologies  inc for approximately billion 
we purchased all of the outstanding capital stock and financed the acquisition with cash on hand and borrowings of million under a new credit facility 
letourneau designs  builds and supports equipment for the mining industry and has been a leader in the earthmoving equipment industry since the s 
letourneau historically operated in three business segments  mining  steel products and drilling products 
the mining products business is the world s leading manufacturer of large wheel loaders for surface mining  providing the industry s largest model sizes and payload capacities 
on october  we completed the sale of letourneau technologies drilling systems  inc to cameron international corporation for million in cash  subject to a post closing working capital adjustment 
in connection with this transaction  the letourneau facilities in houston  texas and vicksburg  mississippi have been sold while the longview  texas facility will remain with us 
we have entered into a transition manufacturing and supply agreement to allow for the orderly transfer of drilling products work from longview and a steel supply agreement to allow the buyer time to develop other sources 
in conjunction with our entrance into the transition manufacturing and supply agreement  we recognized an upfront loss and related liability of million for manufacturing costs to be incurred that will not be reimbursed 
the results of the drilling products business are included in discontinued operations on the accompanying consolidated statement of income and the assets and liabilities of the drilling products business that either transferred after our fiscal year end or remain our obligation are reflected as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the results of the mining and steel businesses collectively the mining equipment business are included in our surface mining equipment segment 
from the date of acquisition until our fiscal year end  the mining equipment business of letourneau had net sales of million and operating income of million 

index international mining machinery on july  we entered into a share purchase agreement spa with tjcc holdings limited  a corporation controlled by the jordan company  lp  to acquire million shares of common stock  or approximately  of imm  for hk per share  or approximately million subject to exchange rate fluctuation 
imm is a leading designer and manufacturer of underground coal mining equipment in china 
on july   august  and september  we purchased approximately million  million and million shares  respectively  of imm for a total of million 
these shares were purchased on the open market and represent approximately of the total outstanding shares of imm 
on december   mofcom approved the purchase of imm shares covered by the spa and the acquisition is expected to close on or around december  at such time  we will have a controlling interest of approximately of imm s outstanding common stock and accordingly will be required under rule of the hong kong takeovers code to make an unconditional cash tender offer to purchase the remaining outstanding shares and options to purchase shares at a minimum per share purchase price of hk 
if all of the shares and options to purchase shares of imm common stock are purchased  the aggregate purchase price would be approximately million subject to exchange rate fluctuation 
we expect that this investment in imm will strengthen our presence in china and other emerging markets 
imm reported revenues of rmb  million million and operating profit of rmb million million for its most recent fiscal year ending december  during fiscal  our initial investment in imm was accounted for under the equity method and we recognized estimated income of million 
operating results bookings for were billion  an increase of from the prior year 
original equipment bookings increased billion  or from the prior year and were driven by electric mining shovel orders for copper in south america and coal in north america and room and pillar orders in the us and longwall systems orders in australia 
aftermarket bookings increased million  or  as parts and service orders remain strong across most regions for both the underground mining machinery and surface mining equipment segments 
the increase in both original equipment and aftermarket orders reflects continued demand for mining equipment as demand for commodities remains strong 
fiscal year bookings included a million favorable effect of foreign currency translation 
net sales for totaled billion compared to billion in aftermarket sales increased million  or  when compared to the prior year on increased parts sales across all regions for both the underground mining machinery and surface mining equipment segments

foreign currency translation favorably impacted sales by million 
operating income was million in  compared to million in and included an million favorable effect of foreign currency translation 
the increase in operating income was primarily the result of increased sales volumes  positive price realization  and favorable overhead absorption 
these items were partially offset by increased product development  selling and administrative expenses 
the results of letourneau s mining equipment business are included in our surface mining equipment segment 
from june  through the end of our fiscal year  letourneau s mining equipment business had bookings of million  net sales of million and operating income of million 
operating income was reduced by million for purchase accounting charges  of which million was attributable to acquired inventories 
net income from continuing operations was million or per diluted share in compared to million or per diluted share in

aftermarket sales increased across all regions 
specifically  aftermarket sales increased in the us and australasia by million and million  respectively  primarily due to the strengthening of the parts and rebuild markets in these regions 
additionally  strong parts demand in china caused aftermarket sales to increase by  or million 
the increase in original equipment sales was led primarily by increased room and pillar sales in both the us and south africa and by roof support sales for longwall application equipment orders in australasia 
these increases were partially offset by decreased longwall equipment volumes in eurasia and china 
foreign currency translation favorably impacted sales by million 
surface mining equipment net sales for were billion compared to billion for  which included a million increase in aftermarket sales  a million increase in original equipment sales and million in sales from the mining equipment business of letourneau 
aftermarket sales increased across all regions and were led by increased sales in north and south america of million and million  respectively 
original equipment sales of electric mining shovels and drills increased across all regions  with the exception of north america

selling costs increased by million due to travel  warehouse costs to support increased parts volumes and the inclusion of million from letourneau s mining equipment business 
administrative expenses increased primarily due to acquisition transaction costs 
net interest expense net interest expense was million in  compared to million in net interest expense increased as a result of additional borrowings 
we entered into a million term loan dated june  for the acquisition of letourneau and issued million of senior notes on october  in anticipation of completing the imm transaction 
provision for income taxes income tax expense for was million  as compared to million in the effective income tax rates from continuing operations were and  for and  respectively 
the main drivers of the variance in tax rates when compared to the statutory rate of were the geographic mix of earnings with the corresponding net favorable differences in foreign statutory tax rates and the utilization of tax credits and tax holidays  offset by increased state income taxes and the establishment of valuation reserves 
a net discrete tax benefit of million was recorded in as compared to a net discrete tax benefit of million in a review of uncertain income tax positions was performed throughout and as part of the overall income tax provision and a net benefit of million and million  respectively  was recorded on a global basis 

index compared with sales the following table sets forth and net sales as derived from our consolidated statement of income in thousands change change net sales underground mining machinery surface mining equipment eliminations total underground mining machinery net sales for were billion compared to billion for  and included a million decrease in original equipment sales  partially offset by a million increase in aftermarket sales 
net sales in increased by million due to the effect of foreign currency translation 
original equipment sales decreased by million in the united states and million in australasia  primarily due to decreased longwall equipment shipments in both regions 
original equipment sales also decreased in south africa by million  primarily due to decreased room and pillar and longwall mining equipment shipments 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in original equipment sales  primarily of longwall equipment  in china 
aftermarket sales were up in all regions  but most significantly in south africa  primarily due to complete machine rebuilds 
surface mining equipment net sales for were billion compared to billion for  and included a million increase in aftermarket sales  partially offset by a million decrease in original equipment sales 
net sales in increased by million due to the effect of foreign currency translation 
the decrease in original equipment was primarily due to decreased electric mining shovel and drill sales and decreased crushing and conveying equipment sales  which were partially offset by increased alliance sales 
the increase in aftermarket sales was primarily related to increased repair and rebuilds in all regions  with the exception of emerging markets

reorganization items reorganization items include income  expenses  and losses that were realized or incurred by the predecessor company as a result of its decision to reorganize under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
we emerged from protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code on july  net reorganization items for   and consisted of the following in thousands beloit uk receivership settlement professional fees directly related to the reorganization and other net reorganization expense income 
index critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  excess inventory  warranty  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the accounting policies described below are the policies that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments  and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on aftermarket products and services when the following criteria are satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery and title transfer has occurred or the services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue on long term contracts  such as for the manufacture of mining shovels  draglines  roof support systems and conveyor systems  using the percentage of completion method 
when using the percentage of completion method  sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion 
sales and gross profit are adjusted prospectively for revisions in estimated total contract costs and contract values 
estimated losses are recognized in full when identified 
approximately of our sales in were recorded at the time of shipment of the product or delivery of the service  with the remaining of sales recorded using percentage of completion accounting 
we have life cycle management contracts with customers to supply parts and service for terms of to years 
these contracts are established based on the conditions the equipment will be operating in  the time horizon that the contracts will cover  and the expected operating cycle that will be required for the equipment 
based on this information  a model is created representing the projected costs and revenues of servicing the respective machines over the specified contract terms 
accounting for these contracts requires us to make various estimates  including estimates of the relevant machine s long term maintenance requirements 
under these contracts  customers are generally billed monthly based on hours of operation or units of production achieved by the equipment  with the respective deferred revenues recorded when billed 
revenue is recognized in the period in which parts are supplied or services provided 
these contracts are reviewed quarterly by comparison of actual results to original estimates or most recent analysis  with revenue recognition adjusted appropriately for future estimated costs 
if a loss is expected at any time  the full amount of the loss is recognized immediately 
we have certain customer agreements that are multiple element arrangements as defined by the accounting standards codification asc no 
multiple element arrangements 
the agreements are assessed for multiple elements based on the following criteria the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item  and the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
revenue is then allocated to each identified unit of accounting based on our estimate of their relative fair values 
revenue recognition involves judgments  including assessments of expected returns  the likelihood of nonpayment  and estimates of expected costs and profits on long term contracts 
we analyze various factors  including a review of specific transactions  historical experience  credit worthiness of customers  and current market and economic conditions  in determining when to recognize revenue 
changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized with a resulting impact on the timing and amount of associated income 

index inventories inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first in  first out method for all inventories 
we evaluate the need to record valuation adjustments for inventory on a regular basis 
our policy is to evaluate all inventories including raw material  work in process  finished goods  and spare parts 
inventory in excess of our estimated usage requirements is written down to its estimated net realizable value 
inherent in the estimates of net realizable value are estimates related to our future manufacturing schedules  customer demand  possible alternative uses  and ultimate realization of potentially excess inventory 
goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets include drawings  patents  trademarks  technology  customer relationships and other specifically identifiable assets 
indefinite lived intangible assets are not being amortized 
indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes occur that suggest impairment in carrying value  such as a significant adverse change in the business climate 
as part of the impairment analysis  we use the discounted cash flow model based on royalties estimated to be derived in the future use of the asset were we to license the use of the indefinite lived asset 
no impairment was identified as part of our fourth quarter impairment testing of our indefinite lived intangible assets 
finite lived intangible assets are amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed  which is principally the straight line method 
intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment if events or changes occur that suggest impairment in carrying value 
no impairment was identified related to our finite lived intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination 
goodwill is assigned to specific reporting units  which we have identified as our operating segments  and tested for impairment at least annually  during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that a reporting unit s carrying amount is greater than its fair value 
goodwill is tested for impairment using the two step approach  in accordance with asc no 
 intangibles goodwill and other 
the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the recorded book value  step one 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is not considered impaired and step two is not considered necessary 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the impairment test continues by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value is computed by adjusting all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to current fair value with the offset adjustment to goodwill 
the adjusted goodwill balance is the implied fair value of the goodwill 
an impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
the discounted cash flow model involves many assumptions  including operating results forecasts and discount rates 
inherent in the operating results forecasts are certain assumptions regarding revenue growth rates  projected cost saving initiatives and projected long term growth rates in the determination of terminal values 
we performed our goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of and no impairment was identified 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate used to determine the fair value of the reporting units would not cause the carrying value of the respective reporting unit to exceed its fair value 
accrued warranties we record accruals for potential warranty claims based on prior claim experience 
warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized 
these warranty costs are based upon management s assessment of past claims and current experience 
however  actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated  as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation as a result of many factors that cannot be predicted with certainty 

index pension and postretirement benefits and costs pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
the primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates and rate of compensation increases  discussed below discount rates we generally estimate the discount rate for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations using a process based on a hypothetical investment in a portfolio of high quality bonds that approximate the estimated cash flows of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
we believe this approach permits a matching of future cash outflows related to benefit payments with future cash inflows associated with bond coupons and maturities 
expected return on plan assets our expected return on plan assets is derived from reviews of asset allocation strategies and anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes weighted by the allocation of our plan assets 
our analysis gives appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns  however  the assumptions are primarily based on long term  prospective rates of return 
mortality rates mortality rates are based on the rp mortality table 
rate of compensation increase the rate of compensation increase reflects our long term actual experience and its outlook  including consideration of expected rates of inflation 
actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods  and therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement plan obligations and future expense 
future changes affecting the above assumptions will change the related pension benefit or expense 
as such  a change in the discount rate and rate of return on net assets would have the following effects on projected benefit obligation and pension expense  respectively  as of and for the fiscal year ended october  increase decrease discount expected long term discount expected long term in thousands rate rate of return rate rate of return us pension plans net pension expense projected benefit obligation non us pension plans net pension expense projected benefit obligation other postretirement benefit plans net pension expense projected benefit obligation income taxes deferred taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current statutory tax rates 
deferred income tax provisions are based on changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities from period to period 
additionally  we analyze our ability to recognize the net deferred tax assets created in each jurisdiction in which we operate to determine if valuation allowances are necessary based on the more likely than not criteria 

index as required under the application of fresh start accounting  the release of pre emergence tax valuation reserves was not recorded in the income statement but instead was treated first as a reduction of excess reorganization value until exhausted  then intangibles until exhausted  and thereafter reported as additional paid in capital 
consequently  a net tax charge will be incurred in future years when these tax assets are utilized 
we will continue to monitor the appropriateness of the existing valuation allowances and determine annually the amount of valuation allowances that are required to be maintained 
as of october   there were million of valuation allowances against pre emergence net operating loss carryforwards 
all future reversals of pre emergence valuation allowances will be recorded to additional paid in capital 
we estimate the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full year on an interim basis 
the estimated effective tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned eg  united states compared to non united states as well as tax planning strategies 
if the actual results are different from these estimates  adjustments to the effective tax rate may be required in the period such determination is made 
additionally  discrete items are treated separately from the effective rate analysis and are recorded separately as an income tax provision or benefit at the time they are recognized 
to the extent recognized  these items will impact the effective tax rate in aggregate but will not adjust the amount used for future periods within the same year 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes the major elements of our working capital as of in millions october  october  accounts receivable inventories accounts payable advance payments trade working capital other current assets short term notes payable employee compensation and benefits accrued warranties other current liabilities working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents working capital the mining equipment business of letourneau added million to trade working capital at october  we currently use trade working capital and cash flow from operations as two financial measurements to evaluate the performance of our operations and our ability to meet our financial obligations 
we require trade working capital investment because our service model requires us to maintain certain inventory levels in order to maximize our customers machine reliability 
this information also provides management with a focus on our receivable terms and collectability efforts and our ability to obtain advance payments on original equipment orders 
as part of our continuous improvement of purchasing and manufacturing processes  we continue to strive for alignment of inventory levels with customer demand and current production schedules 
cash provided by continuing operations for was million as compared to million provided by operations for cash provided by continuing operations was unfavorably impacted by increasing inventory levels to support our rising backlog  increases in retiree benefit plan payments over prior year  and increases in accounts receivables primarily due to improved sales in all regions in fiscal year cash provided by continuing operations was favorably impacted by advance payments due to bookings in excess of shipments and increases in accounts payable 

index cash used by investing activities was billion in compared to million for the increase in cash used by investing activities for was driven by the billion acquisition of letourneau  cash deposits of million into an escrow account in anticipation of completing the imm spa and tender offer and million of imm share purchases 
this was partially offset by the million sale of the drilling products business of letourneau 
cash provided by financing activities for was million compared to cash used by financing activities of million for the change to cash being provided by financing activities for was driven by the entrance into a new million term loan for the acquisition of letourneau and the issuance of million of senior notes in anticipation of completing the imm acquisition 
we expect capital spending to be approximately million 
capital projects will be focused on expanding service center capabilities globally and the increase of our manufacturing capabilities in the emerging markets 
during each quarter of fiscal we declared a cash dividend of per outstanding share of common stock and in fiscal we paid million in dividends 
for fiscal year we expect to contribute million to million to our employee pension plans 
as of october  we have a net unfunded pension and other post retirement liability of million 
to fund our acquisition of imm  we have million of restricted cash in escrow  of which million was provided by the sale of the drilling products business of letourneau and million was provided by the net proceeds of the october issuance of our million senior notes due october  the notes 
we also have a million term loan commitment that we entered into on october  and we have a remaining commitment of million that we may draw under the bridge loan agreement dated july  however  if we do not receive approval from mofcom  the million held in escrow will become unrestricted cash  the notes may be redeemed  in whole  but not in part  and we would not draw upon the commitments under the october  term loan or the july  bridge loan agreement 
we believe our liquidity and capital resources are adequate to meet our projected needs 
we have million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at october   of which million is held outside of the united states  and million of restricted cash in escrow 
requirements for working capital  dividends  pension contributions  capital spending  acquisitions and principal and interest payments on our term loan and senior notes will be adequately funded by cash on hand  continuing operations and supplemented by short and long term borrowings  as required 
credit facilities and senior notes on june   we exercised our option under the million unsecured revolving credit facility dated as of october  the credit agreement to increase the aggregate revolving commitment available by an additional million 
as increased  the million credit agreement is set to expire november  in fiscal we took a pre tax charge of million related to deferred financing costs associated with the termination of the previous million unsecured revolving credit facility that was to have expired on november  under the terms of the credit agreement we pay a commitment fee ranging from to on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility based on our credit rating 
outstanding borrowings bear interest equal to the london interbank offered rate libor defined as applicable libor rate for the equivalent interest period plus to depending upon our credit rating or the base rate defined as the highest of the prime rate  federal funds rate plus  or eurodollar rate plus at our option 
the credit agreement requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants including leverage and interest coverage ratios 
the credit agreement also restricts payment of dividends or other return of capital when the consolidated leverage ratio exceeds a stated amount 
at october   we were in compliance with all financial covenants of the credit agreement and had no restrictions on the payment of dividends or return of capital 

index at october   there were no direct borrowings under the credit agreement 
outstanding letters of credit issued under the credit agreement  which count toward the million credit limit  totaled million 
at october   there was million available for borrowings under the credit agreement 
in november  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due notes with interest on the notes being paid semi annually in arrears on may and november of each year  starting on may  the notes are guaranteed by each of our current and future material domestic subsidiaries 
the notes were issued in a private placement under an exemption from registration provided by the securities act of securities act  as amended 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the notes were exchanged for substantially identical notes that are registered under the securities act 
at our option  we may redeem some or all of the notes at a redemption price of the greater of of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the principal amounts and the remaining scheduled interest payments using a discount rate equal to the sum of a treasury rate of a comparable treasury issue plus for the notes and for the notes 
the acquisition of letourneau was funded in part by utilizing in full a new million term loan commitment term loan dated june  the term loan requires quarterly principal payments beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and matures june  the term loan contains terms and conditions that are substantially similar to the terms and conditions of the credit agreement 
outstanding borrowings bear interest equal to libor defined as applicable libor rate for the equivalent interest period plus to depending upon our credit rating or the base rate defined as the highest of the prime rate  federal funds rate plus  or eurodollar rate plus at our option 
the term loan is guaranteed by each of our current and future material domestic subsidiaries and requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants  including leverage and interest coverage ratios 
at october   we were in compliance with all financial covenants of the term loan 
on july  we entered into a spa to acquire approximately of the outstanding common stock of imm  a hong kong stock exchange listed designer and manufacturer of underground and coal mining equipment located in china 
pursuant to rule of the hong kong takeovers code  upon receipt of regulatory approval and closing of the purchase under the spa  we will be required to make an offer for the remaining imm shares and outstanding options to purchase imm shares 
in conjunction with the spa  we entered into a billion senior unsecured bridge term loan facility on july  the bridge loan agreement that has subsequently been reduced under terms of the bridge loan agreement by the value of open market purchases of imm shares  cash deposits into escrow from the new senior notes due  proceeds from the closing of the sale of letourneau s drilling products business  and voluntary reductions 
under the original terms of the bridge loan agreement  we had the ability to draw up to a maximum of million on the closing date of the spa and subsequently in multiple draws of no less than million at any time during the period beginning on the commencement of the mandatory tender offer and ending on the date on which all amounts payable with respect to the tender offer have been paid 
as a result of the commitment reductions outlined above  the bridge loan agreement provides the ability to draw a total of million 
under the terms of the bridge loan agreement  proceeds of any advances under the commitment are to be deposited to the escrow account associated with the imm offer 
any unused commitments of the bridge loan agreement shall expire on the earlier of i the date on which the spa is terminated without the purchase having been consummated  ii march   unless the purchase is consummated on or prior to such date  iii the date that is days following the purchase date  as defined in the bridge loan agreement  iv the date on which all amounts payable pursuant to the tender offer have been paid  v the date on which the commitments are terminated  reduced or prepaid  or vi may  outstanding borrowings bear interest equal to eurodollar rate plus a margin that varies with our credit rating and base rate loans defined as the higher of the prime rate  federal funds effective rate plus or one month eurodollar rate plus plus a margin that varies with our credit rating 
we also pay a commitment fee ranging from to on the undrawn portion of the credit facility based on our credit rating 
the bridge loan agreement requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants  including leverage and interest coverage ratios that are substantially similar to those in the credit agreement 
at october   no amounts were outstanding under the bridge loan agreement and we were in compliance with all financial covenants of the bridge loan agreement 
on october   we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due october  the notes 
interest on the notes will be paid semi annually in arrears on october and april of each year  starting on april  and the notes are guaranteed by each of our current and future material domestic subsidiaries 
at our option  we may redeem some or all of the notes at a redemption price of the greater of of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the principal amounts and the remaining scheduled interest payments using a discount rate equal to the sum of a treasury rate of a comparable treasury issue plus
