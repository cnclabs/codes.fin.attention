item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto in item of this report 
we provide contract drilling services to the energy industry around the globe and are a leader in offshore drilling 
our current fleet of offshore drilling rigs consists of semisubmersibles  jack ups and one drillship 
overview industry conditions on october   the us government lifted the ban on certain drilling activities in the gom 
all drilling in the gom is now subject to compliance with enhanced safety requirements set forth in notices to lessees  or ntl  n and n  both of which were implemented during the drilling ban 
additionally  all drilling in the gom is required to comply with the interim final rule to enhance safety measures for energy development on the outer continental shelf drilling safety rule and the workplace safety rule on safety and environmental management systems  which have become final  as well as ntl n known as the compliance and review ntl 
we continue to evaluate these new measures to ensure that our rigs and equipment are in full compliance  where applicable 
additional requirements could be forthcoming based on further recommendations by regulatory agencies investigating the macondo incident 
we are not able to predict the likelihood  nature or extent of additional rulemaking 
nor are we able to predict when the bureau of ocean energy management  regulation and enforcement  or boemre  will issue drilling permits to our customers 
we are not able to predict the future impact of these events on our operations 
even with the drilling ban lifted  certain deepwater drilling activities remain suspended until the boemre resumes its regular permitting of those activities 
it has been reported that the industry currently has floating rigs in the gom that have been impacted by the moratorium and that five floating rigs have left the gom since the imposition of the moratorium  two of which rigs were ours 
as of the date of this report  we have two semisubmersible units under contract in the gom  in addition to the ocean monarch  whose contract the operator has sought to terminate as discussed below  as well as two jack up units  one of which is under contract 
given the continuing uncertainty with respect to drilling activity in the gom  our customers may seek to move additional rigs to locations outside of the gom or perform activities which are allowed under the enhanced safety requirements 
in june  one of our customers asserted force majeure as a basis for its termination of the drilling contract for the ocean monarch  which had a remaining term of approximately months 
the operator has also filed suit against us in us district court in houston seeking a declaratory judgment that its termination of the drilling contract is warranted under the contract 
we do not believe the events cited by the operator come within the definition of force majeure under the drilling contract  and we do not believe that the operator has the right to terminate the drilling contract on this basis 
although we cannot predict with certainty the results of any such litigation  and there can be no assurance as to its ultimate outcome  we intend to vigorously defend this litigation and challenge the operator s attempt to terminate the drilling contract 
we are continuing to actively seek international opportunities to keep our rigs employed 
however  we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to employ our remaining impacted rigs in the gom in the near term 
in addition  given the ongoing uncertainty in the gom with respect to drilling activity and other industry factors  we have cold stacked two intermediate floaters and four jack up rigs in the gom 
while dayrates we receive for new contracts are no longer at the peak levels achieved at the height of the most recent up cycle  improving oil prices  which had climbed to approximately per barrel by the end of  appear to be supporting demand for our equipment 
as a result  dayrates for our international floater units appear to have stabilized  though demand for our services has not risen sufficiently to provide significant pricing power on new contracts 
additionally  the continuing regulatory uncertainty in the gom could cause diamond offshore or others to move additional rigs out of the gom to international locations 
if we  or others  move a large number of additional rigs out of the gom to international locations  the increased supply of available rigs entering the international market  coupled with un contracted new build rigs scheduled for delivery between now and the end of  could create downward pressure on dayrates unless demand improves sufficiently to absorb the new supply 
since september  through the date of this report  we have entered into new drilling contracts totaling approximately million in backlog and ranging in duration from one well to one year 
as of february   our contract backlog was approximately billion  of which our contracts in the gom excluding amounts related 
table of contents to the contract for the ocean monarch discussed above represented approximately million  or  of our total contract backlog 
floaters our intermediate and high specification floater rigs  both domestic and international  accounted for approximately of our revenue during approximately of the time on our intermediate and high specification floater rigs is committed for additionally  of the time on our floating rigs is committed in international jack ups during the fourth quarter of  demand for our international jack ups remained weak but stable 
however  the high specification new build equipment coming to market is enjoying a significantly higher utilization rate than older existing equipment  and the oversupply of jack up rigs could have an increasingly negative impact on the international sector throughout and beyond 
us gulf of mexico jack ups the jack up market in the gom has been negatively impacted by the slow issuance of jack up permits subsequent to the lifting of the drilling moratorium  as well as the impact of lower natural gas prices on both demand and dayrates 
our two remaining jack ups in the gom are largely working under short term contracts and could experience significant downtime unless permitting activity increases 
absent an increase in permitting activity and a sustained improvement in natural gas prices  weakness in the gom jack up market is likely to continue in  with the possibility of additional rigs being cold stacked by us and others in the industry 
egyptian operations we currently have one high specification floater and two jack up rigs contracted offshore egypt with an aggregate net book value of million  or approximately of our total operating assets at december  although these rigs have continued to work throughout the recent political unrest in egypt  there have been  and in the future there may be other  disruptions to the support networks within egypt  including the banking institutions 
at february   our contract drilling backlog related to our drilling operations offshore egypt was approximately million  or of our total contract drilling backlog  for our customers may attempt to assert force majeure under the agreements under which these rigs are operating 
as of the date of this report  we have not received any force majeure assertions with respect to our egyptian operations 
contract drilling backlog the following table reflects our contract drilling backlog as of february   october  the date reported in our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september  and february  the date reported in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  
contract drilling backlog is calculated by multiplying the contracted operating dayrate by the firm contract period and adding one half of any potential rig performance bonuses 
our calculation also assumes full utilization of our drilling equipment for the contract period excluding scheduled shipyard and survey days  however  the amount of actual revenue earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned will be different than the amounts and periods shown in the tables below due to various factors 
utilization rates  which generally approach during contracted periods  can be adversely impacted by downtime due to various operating factors including  but not limited to  weather conditions and unscheduled repairs and maintenance 
contract drilling backlog excludes revenues for mobilization  demobilization  contract preparation and customer reimbursables 
no revenue is generally earned during periods of downtime for regulatory surveys 
changes in our contract drilling backlog between periods are a function of the performance of work on term contracts  as well as the extension or modification of existing term contracts and the execution of additional contracts

table of contents the following table reflects the percentage of rig days committed by year as of february  the percentage of rig days committed is calculated as the ratio of total days committed under contracts  as well as scheduled shipyard  survey and mobilization days for all rigs in our fleet  to total available days number of rigs multiplied by the number of days in a particular year 
for the years ending december  rig days committed high specification floaters intermediate semisubmersibles jack ups includes approximately and scheduled shipyard  survey and mobilization days for and  respectively 
general the two most significant variables affecting our revenues are dayrates for rigs and rig utilization rates  each of which is a function of rig supply and demand in the marketplace 
demand for drilling services is dependent upon the level of expenditures set by oil and gas companies for offshore exploration and development  as well as a variety of political  regulatory and economic factors 
the availability of rigs in a particular geographical region also affects both dayrates and utilization rates 
these factors are not within our control and are difficult to predict 
demand affects the number of days our fleet is utilized and the dayrates earned 
as utilization rates increase  dayrates tend to increase as well  reflecting the lower supply of available rigs 
conversely  as utilization rates decrease  dayrates tend to decrease as well  reflecting the excess supply of rigs 
when a rig is idle  no dayrate is earned and revenues will decrease as a result 
revenues can also be affected as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs  required surveys and shipyard upgrades 
in order to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates  we may mobilize our rigs from one market to another 
however  during periods of mobilization  revenues may be adversely affected 
as a response to changes in demand  we may withdraw a rig from the market by stacking it or may reactivate a rig stacked previously  which may decrease or increase revenues  respectively 
we recognize revenue from dayrate drilling contracts as services are performed 
in connection with such drilling contracts  we may receive fees either lump sum or dayrate for the mobilization of equipment 
we earn these fees as services are performed over the initial term of the related drilling contracts 
we defer mobilization fees received  as well as direct and incremental mobilization costs incurred  and amortize each  on a straight line basis  over the term of the related drilling contracts which is the period we estimate to be benefited from the mobilization activity 
straight line amortization of mobilization revenues and related costs over the term of the related drilling contracts which generally range from two to months is consistent with the timing of net cash flows generated from the actual drilling services performed 
absent a contract  mobilization costs are recognized currently 
from time to time  we may receive fees from our customers for capital improvements to our rigs either lump sum or dayrate 
we defer such fees and recognize them into income on a straight line basis over the period of the related drilling contract as a component of contract drilling revenue 
we capitalize the costs of such capital improvements and depreciate them over the estimated useful life of the improvement 
we receive reimbursements for the purchase of supplies  equipment  personnel services and other services provided at the request of our customers in accordance with a contract or agreement 
we record these reimbursements at the gross amount billed to the customer as revenues related to reimbursable expenses in our consolidated statements of operations included in item of this report 
operating income 
our operating income is primarily affected by revenue factors  but is also a function of varying levels of operating expenses 
our operating expenses represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and maintenance of our drilling equipment 
the principal components of our operating costs are  among other things  direct and indirect costs of labor and benefits  repairs and maintenance  freight  regulatory inspections  boat and helicopter rentals and insurance 
labor and repair and maintenance costs represent the most significant components of our operating expenses 
in general  our labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels  rig staffing requirements and costs associated with labor regulations in the geographic regions in which our rigs operate 
costs to repair and maintain our equipment fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the drilling unit is performing  as well as the age and condition of the equipment and the regions in which our rigs are working 

table of contents our operating costs are also impacted by the regulatory environments in which we operate 
the adoption of new regulations could result in additional inspection and certification costs  as well as require additional capital investment to comply with regulatory requirements 
accordingly  we cannot fully predict the financial impact of new regulations that have been adopted subsequent to the macondo incident in april for rigs operating in the gom  or any new regulations that may arise as the investigation into the incident continues or as a result of further recommendations by regulatory agencies 
new laws or regulations may require an increase in our capital spending for additional equipment to comply with such requirements 
our business could be negatively impacted by additional downtime which may be required to obtain necessary equipment and to install such equipment or to obtain the required inspections or certifications as prescribed under such regulations 
operating expenses generally are not affected by changes in dayrates  and short term reductions in utilization do not necessarily result in lower operating expenses 
for instance  if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time  few decreases in operating expenses may actually occur since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared or ready stacked state with a full crew 
in addition  when a rig is idle  we are responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs  which are typically costs of the operator when a rig is under contract 
however  if the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time  we may reduce the size of a rig s crew and take steps to cold stack the rig  which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income 
we recognize  as incurred  operating expenses related to activities such as inspections  painting projects and routine overhauls that meet certain criteria and which maintain rather than upgrade our rigs 
these expenses vary from period to period 
costs of rig enhancements are capitalized and depreciated over the expected useful lives of the enhancements 
higher depreciation expense decreases operating income in periods following capital upgrades 
our operating income is negatively impacted when we perform certain regulatory inspections  which we refer to as a year survey  or special survey  that are due every five years for each of our rigs 
operating revenue decreases because these special surveys are performed during scheduled downtime in a shipyard 
operating expenses increase as a result of these special surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs to a shipyard  inspection costs incurred and repair and maintenance costs 
repair and maintenance activities may result from the special survey or may have been previously planned to take place during this mandatory downtime 
the number of rigs undergoing a year survey will vary from year to year  as well as from quarter to quarter 
in addition  operating income may be negatively impacted by intermediate surveys  which are performed at interim periods between year surveys 
intermediate surveys are generally less extensive in duration and scope than a year survey 
although an intermediate survey may require some downtime for the drilling rig  it normally does not require dry docking or shipyard time  except for rigs located in the uk and norwegian sectors of the north sea 
during  seven of our rigs will require year surveys  and we expect that they will be out of service for approximately days in the aggregate 
we also expect to spend an additional approximately days during for intermediate surveys  the mobilization of rigs  contract acceptance testing and extended maintenance projects 
we can provide no assurance as to the exact timing and or duration of downtime associated with regulatory inspections  planned rig mobilizations and other shipyard projects 
see overview contract drilling backlog 
we are self insured for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the us gulf of mexico 
if a named windstorm in the us gulf of mexico causes significant damage to our rigs or equipment  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
under our insurance policy that expires on may   we carry physical damage insurance for certain losses other than those caused by named windstorms in the us gulf of mexico for which our deductible for physical damage is million per occurrence 
we do not typically retain loss of hire insurance policies to cover our rigs 
in addition  under our insurance policy that expires on may   we carry marine liability insurance covering certain legal liabilities  including coverage for certain personal injury claims  with no exclusions for pollution and or environmental risk 
we believe that the policy limit for our marine liability insurance is within the range that is customary for companies of our size in the offshore drilling industry and is appropriate for our business 
our deductibles for marine liability coverage  including for personal injury claims  are million for the first occurrence and vary in amounts ranging between million and  if aggregate claims exceed certain thresholds  up to million for each subsequent occurrence  depending on the nature  severity and frequency of claims which might arise during the policy year  which under the current policy commences on may of each year 
as a result of the macondo 
table of contents incident  insurance costs across the industry are expected to increase and in the future  certain insurance coverage is likely to become more costly  and may become less available or not available at all 
construction and capital upgrade projects 
we capitalize interest cost for the construction and upgrade of qualifying assets in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or gaap 
the period of interest capitalization covers the duration of the activities required to make the asset ready for its intended use  and the capitalization period ends when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
for the year ended december   we capitalized interest of million on qualifying expenditures related to the upgrades of the ocean monarch for ultra deepwater service and the construction of two jack up rigs  the ocean shield and ocean scepter  through the date of each project s completion 
we did not capitalize interest on any qualifying assets during or critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are included in note general information to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
judgments  assumptions and estimates by our management are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements and the application of our significant accounting policies 
we believe that our most critical accounting estimates are as follows property  plant and equipment 
we carry our drilling and other property and equipment at cost 
maintenance and routine repairs are charged to income currently while replacements and betterments  which meet certain criteria  are capitalized 
depreciation is amortized up to applicable salvage values by applying the straight line method over the remaining estimated useful lives 
our management makes judgments  assumptions and estimates regarding capitalization  useful lives and salvage values 
changes in these judgments  assumptions and estimates could produce results that differ from those reported 
we evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable such as cold stacking a rig or excess spending over budget on a new build or major rig upgrade 
we utilize a probability weighted cash flow analysis in testing an asset for potential impairment 
our assumptions and estimates underlying this analysis may include the following dayrate by rig  utilization rate by rig expressed as the actual percentage of time per year that the rig would be used  the per day operating cost for each rig if active  ready stacked or cold stacked  the estimated maintenance  inspection or other costs associated with a rig returning to work  salvage value for each rig  and estimated proceeds that may be received on disposition of the rig 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we develop a matrix by assigning probabilities to various combinations of assumed utilization rates and dayrates 
we also consider the impact of a reduction in assumed dayrates for the cold stacked rigs holding all other assumptions and estimates in the model constant 
as of december   we had cold stacked four jack up rigs consisting of three mat supported rigs and one independent leg  cantilevered rig all in the gom and three intermediate semisubmersible drilling rigs two in the gom and one in malaysia 
we performed an impairment review for each of these rigs using the methodology described above 
based on our analyses  we have concluded that these seven rigs were not subject to impairment at december  management s assumptions are an inherent part of our asset impairment evaluation and the use of different assumptions could produce results that differ from those reported 

table of contents personal injury claims 
our deductibles for liability coverage for personal injury claims  which primarily result from jones act liability in the gulf of mexico  are currently million per the first occurrence  with no aggregate deductible  and vary in amounts ranging between million and  if aggregate claims exceed certain thresholds  up to million for each subsequent occurrence  depending on the nature  severity and frequency of claims which might arise during the policy year 
the jones act is a federal law that permits seamen to seek compensation for certain injuries during the course of their employment on a vessel and governs the liability of vessel operators and marine employers for the work related injury or death of an employee 
we engage outside consultants to assist us in estimating our aggregate reserve for personal injury claims based on our historical losses and utilizing various actuarial models 
the models used in estimating our aggregate reserve for personal injury claims include actuarial assumptions such as claim emergence  or the delay between occurrence and recording of claims  settlement patterns  or the rates at which claims are closed  development patterns  or the rate at which known cases develop to their ultimate level  average  potential frequency and severity of claims  and effect of re opened claims 
the eventual settlement or adjudication of these claims could differ materially from our estimated amounts due to uncertainties such as the severity of personal injuries claimed  significant changes in the volume of personal injury claims  the unpredictability of legal jurisdictions where the claims will ultimately be litigated  inconsistent court decisions  and the risks and lack of predictability inherent in personal injury litigation 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with accounting standards that require the recognition of the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been currently recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
in each of our tax jurisdictions we recognize a current tax liability or asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year and a deferred tax asset or liability for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance  if necessary  which is determined by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence  are not expected to be realized under a more likely than not approach 
we do not establish deferred tax liabilities for certain of our foreign earnings that we intend to indefinitely reinvest to finance foreign activities 
however  if these earnings become subject to us federal tax  any required provision could have a material impact on our financial results 
we make judgments regarding future events and related estimates especially as they pertain to the forecasting of our effective tax rate  the potential realization of deferred tax assets such as utilization of foreign tax credits  and exposure to the disallowance of items deducted on tax returns upon audit 
certain of our international rigs are owned and operated  directly or indirectly  by diamond offshore international limited  or doil  a cayman islands subsidiary which we wholly own 
since forming this subsidiary in  it has been our intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of the subsidiary to finance foreign activities 
consequently  no us federal income taxes are provided on these earnings except to the extent that such earnings were immediately subject to us federal income taxes and except for the earnings of diamond east asia limited  or deal  a wholly owned subsidiary of doil 
it is our intention to repatriate the earnings of deal and  accordingly  us income taxes are provided on its earnings 
in several of the international locations in which we operate  certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries enter into agreements with other of our wholly owned subsidiaries to provide specialized services and equipment in support of our foreign operations 
we apply a transfer pricing methodology to determine the amount to be charged for providing the services and equipment  and utilize outside consultants to assist us in the development of such transfer pricing methodologies 
in most cases  there are alternative transfer pricing methodologies that could be applied to these transactions and  if applied  could result in different chargeable amounts 
we record interest related to accrued unrecognized tax positions in interest expense and recognize penalties associated with uncertain tax positions in our tax expense 

table of contents results of operations although we perform contract drilling services with different types of drilling rigs and in many geographic locations  there is a similarity of economic characteristics among all our divisions and locations  including the nature of services provided and the type of customers for our services 
we believe that the combination of our drilling rigs into one reportable segment is the appropriate aggregation in accordance with applicable accounting standards on segment reporting 
however  for purposes of this discussion and analysis of our results of operations  we provide greater detail with respect to the types of rigs in our fleet and the geographic regions in which they operate to enhance the reader s understanding of our financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations 
years ended december   and comparative data relating to our revenues and operating expenses by equipment type are listed below

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating income 
operating income in decreased million  or  compared to during  our operating results were negatively impacted by a decline in average daily revenue earned by our rigs in from the levels attained in while our contracted revenue backlog enabled us to partially mitigate the impact of the weakened market conditions  our total contract drilling revenue decreased million  or  compared to revenue generated by our domestic and international floater rigs decreased an aggregate million  or  and revenue for our combined jack up fleet decreased million  or  during compared to the previous year 
during  we cold stacked three additional rigs in the gom  consisting of two intermediate floaters  which returned from mexico during the year  and one jack up rig 
however  the two newest additions to our floater fleet  the ocean courage and ocean valor  began operating under contract during the first and fourth quarters of  respectively  and contributed million to our revenue during total contract drilling expense increased million  or  in compared to and included normal operating costs for the ocean courage and ocean valor  as well as increased amortized mobilization costs and higher other operating costs associated with rigs operating internationally rather than domestically 
other significant factors that affected the comparability of our operating income for the years ended december  and were as follows bad debt expense 
in december  we recorded a million provision for bad debts to reserve a portion of the uncollected balance of receivables related to our operations in egypt and recovered million related to a previously established reserve for bad debt recorded in related to our operations in the uk during  we recovered million and million related to previously established reserves for bad debts related to our operations in egypt and the uk  respectively 
depreciation expense 
depreciation expense increased million  or  during compared to primarily due to depreciation associated with capital additions in and  including depreciation of our two newest high specification floaters  the ocean courage and ocean valor  which were placed in service in september and march  respectively  but did not begin drilling operations until gain on disposition of assets 
net gain on disposition of assets in was primarily related to the sale of the ocean shield on july  the rig was sold for net proceeds of million and resulted in a net gain on sale of million 
net gain on disposition of assets in included a million gain on the sale of the ocean tower that was damaged during a hurricane in interest expense 
interest expense increased million in compared to  primarily due to a full year of interest expense in for our senior notes due  or senior notes  and our senior notes due  or senior notes  issued in may and october  respectively million 
in addition  during  we recorded million in interest expense related to uncertain tax positions compared to a million net reduction of accrued interest expense related to an uncertain tax position for which the statute of limitations had expired during foreign currency transaction gain loss 
foreign currency transaction gain loss includes both realized and unrealized gains and losses from the settlement of and from mark to market accounting for our foreign currency forward exchange  or forex  contracts that we have not designated as accounting hedges 
such gains and losses fluctuate based on the level of transactions in foreign currencies  as well as fluctuations in such currencies 
during  we recognized net foreign currency exchange gains of million  including million realized and unrealized gains on forex contracts million in net unrealized gains from mark to market accounting and million in net realized losses on settled forex contracts not designated as accounting hedges 
during  we designated all of our forex contracts as accounting hedges 
income tax expense 
our income tax expense is a function of the mix between our domestic and international pre tax earnings or losses  respectively  as well as the mix of international tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
we recognized million of tax expense on pre tax income of billion for the year ended december  compared to tax expense of million on pre tax income of billion in the effective annual tax rate 
table of contents of in compared unfavorably to the effective annual tax rate of in primarily because of higher taxes for income tax contingencies as well as taxes associated with the sale of the ocean shield 
during  we accrued approximately million of expense for uncertain tax positions  primarily in mexico and brazil  of which million is interest and million is penalty related 
on march   the statute of limitations relative to a uncertain tax position in mexico expired 
as a consequence  we reversed million of previously accrued interest expense and million of previously accrued tax expense  million of which had been accrued for penalties 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating income 
operating income in decreased million  or less than  compared to during  our contracted revenue backlog allowed us to substantially mitigate the impact of the global economic recession on our business 
despite the downturn in the market  our contract drilling revenue increased million in compared to the ocean monarch completed a major upgrade at the end of and began operating under contract in mid march  generating revenue of million 
our two new build jack up rigs  the ocean shield and ocean scepter  were completed in and contributed incremental revenue of million during compared to however  our operating results for were negatively impacted by the ready stacking of the ocean star  ocean victory  ocean guardian and ocean scepter for extended periods and the cold stacking of our three mat supported gom jack up rigs 
the ocean bounty completed its contract offshore australia in the third quarter of and was being prepared for cold stacking in malaysia at the end of total contract drilling expense increased million  or  in compared to and included normal operating costs for the upgraded ocean monarch and a full year of operating costs for our two new build jack ups 
other significant factors that affected the comparability of our operating income for the years ended december  and were as follows bad debt expense 
in december  we recorded a million provision for bad debts to reserve the uncollected balance of one of our customers in the uk that had entered into administration a uk insolvency proceeding similar to us chapter bankruptcy 
we recovered million associated with this reserve for bad debts during in december  we recorded a million provision for bad debts to reserve a portion of the uncollected balance of receivables related to our operations in egypt 
depreciation expense 
depreciation expense increased million  or  during compared to due to a higher depreciable asset base for depreciation expense for included depreciation associated with our capital additions in and  including the ocean shield  ocean scepter and ocean monarch  which were all placed in service at various times during depreciation expense for also included depreciation of the ocean courage  which we acquired in june and placed in service in september casualty loss 
in september  one of our jack up rigs in the gom sustained significant damage  including the loss of the rig s derrick  drill floor and related equipment 
during  we wrote off the approximately million net book value of the lost equipment and accrued million in estimated salvage costs for recovery of equipment from the ocean floor 
gain on disposition of assets 
net gain on disposition of assets in included a million gain on the sale of the ocean tower compared to aggregate net gains of million in on the sale and disposition of miscellaneous equipment 
interest income 
we earned interest income of million in compared to million in the million decrease in interest income was primarily the result of lower average interest bearing cash balances during compared to interest expense 
interest expense in and related primarily to interest accrued on our outstanding indebtedness  net of capitalized interest  and our liabilities for uncertain tax positions 
during  we incurred incremental interest expense of million related to our senior notes and senior notes  partially offset by a net million reduction in accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions 
during  we 
table of contents capitalized interest of million related to qualifying construction projects and major upgrades that were all completed in we did not capitalize interest costs in as there were no qualifying activities during the year 
foreign currency transaction gain loss 
during  we recognized net foreign currency exchange gains of million  which included million in realized and unrealized gains on forex contracts million in net unrealized gains from mark to market accounting and million in net realized losses on settled forex contracts and net gains of million on other foreign currency transactions 
during  we recognized net foreign currency exchange losses of million  which included million in net losses on forex contracts million in net unrealized losses from mark to market accounting and million in net realized losses on settled forex contracts and other net foreign currency transaction losses of million 
income tax expense 
our income tax expense is a function of the mix between our domestic and international pre tax earnings or losses  as well as the mix of international tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
we recognized million of tax expense on pre tax income of billion for the year ended december  compared to tax expense of million on pre tax income of billion in the effective annual tax rate of in compared favorably to the effective annual tax rate of in primarily because of higher earnings of doil in which were taxed at lower rates 
our income tax returns are subject to review and examination in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and we are currently contesting various tax assessments 
we accrue for income tax contingencies  or uncertain tax positions  that we believe are more likely than not exposures 
we recognized expense of million and million for uncertain tax positions in and  respectively 
during the year ended december  we recorded a net reduction to interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of million 
during the year ended december   we recognized million of interest expense related to uncertain tax positions 
penalty related tax expense for uncertain tax positions during the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
on march   the statute of limitations relative to a uncertain tax position in mexico expired 
as a consequence  we reversed million of previously accrued interest expense and million of previously accrued tax expense  million of which had been accrued for penalties 
in december we received an approximately million assessment from the brazilian tax authorities for the years and we contested the tax assessment in january and are awaiting the outcome of the appeal 
as required by gaap  only the portion of the tax benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement is to be recognized 
during we accrued approximately million of expense attributable to the portion of the tax assessment we determined to be an uncertain tax position in our consolidated statements of operations  of which approximately million was interest related and approximately million was penalty related

table of contents sources of liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from our operations and our cash reserves 
we may also make use of our million credit facility for cash liquidity 
see million revolving credit facility 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in investments and marketable securities  representing our investment of cash available for current operations 
cash flows from operations 
our cash flows from operations are impacted by the ability of our customers to weather the instability in the us and global economies and restrictions in the credit market  as well as the volatility in energy prices 
in general  before working for a customer with whom we have not had a prior business relationship and or whose financial stability may appear uncertain to us  we perform a credit review on that company 
based on that analysis  we may require that the customer present a letter of credit  prepay or provide other credit enhancements 
if a potential customer is unable to obtain an adequate level of credit  it may preclude us from doing business with that potential customer 
these external factors which affect our cash flows from operations  many which are not within our control  are difficult to predict 
for a description of other factors that could affect our cash flows from operations  see overview industry conditions  forward looking statements and risk factors in item a of this report 
during  we amended an existing contractual agreement at a customer s request to provide short term financial relief 
the amended contract obligates the customer to pay us  over the term of the six well drilling program  an aggregate drilling rate of  per day  consisting of  per day payable in accordance with our normal credit terms due days after receipt of invoice and the remainder of the contractual dayrate   per day  payable through the conveyance of a net profits interest  or npi  in certain developmental oil and gas producing properties 
as of december   we had drilled four wells for this customer and were owed million payable through the npi 
we began receiving monthly payments from the conveyance of the npi in july and through the date of this report have received an aggregate of million through the npi 
based on current production payout estimates  we expect to collect million of the receivable within the next twelve months and the remaining million of the receivable within the following twelve months 
however  payment of such amounts  and the timing of such payments  are contingent upon such production and upon energy sale prices

table of contents liquidity and capital requirements our liquidity and capital requirements are primarily a function of our working capital needs  capital expenditures and debt service requirements 
we determine the amount of cash required to meet our capital commitments by evaluating the need to upgrade rigs to meet specific customer requirements  our ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs  and our obligations relating to the construction of our new drillships 
we believe that our operating cash flows and cash reserves will be sufficient to meet both our working capital requirements and our capital commitments over the next twelve months  however  we will continue to make periodic assessments based on industry conditions and will adjust capital spending programs if required 
in addition  we may  from time to time  issue debt or equity securities  or a combination thereof  to finance capital expenditures  the acquisition of assets and businesses or for general corporate purposes 
our ability to access the capital markets by issuing debt or equity securities will be dependent on our results of operations  our current financial condition  current market conditions and other factors beyond our control

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information included in this item a is considered to constitute forward looking statements for purposes of the statutory safe harbor provided in section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements in item of this report 
our measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of our financial instruments 
market risk exposure is presented for each class of financial instrument held by us at december  and  assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below 
we believe that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions 
the estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected actual loss  even under adverse conditions  because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ 
in addition  since our investment portfolio is subject to change based on our portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market  these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results that may occur 
exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by our senior management 
senior management approves the overall investment strategy that we employ and has responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy and the level of risk acceptable to us 
we may manage risk by buying or selling instruments or entering into offsetting positions 
interest rate risk we have exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates 
our investments in marketable securities are primarily in fixed maturity securities 
we monitor our sensitivity to interest rate risk by evaluating the change in the value of our financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates 
the evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in interest rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of our investments and the resulting effect on stockholders equity 
the analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which we believe are reasonably possible over a one year period 
the sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the market value of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities that were held on december  and  due to instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve of basis points  with all other variables held constant 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
accordingly  the analysis may not be indicative of  is not intended to provide  and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our earnings or stockholders equity 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions we could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
loans under our million syndicated  senior unsecured revolving credit facility bear interest at our option at a rate per annum equal to i the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus or ii libor plus an applicable margin  varying from to  based on our current credit ratings 
as of december  and  there were no loans outstanding under the credit facility however  as of december  and  million and million  respectively  in letters of credit were issued and outstanding under the credit facility 
our long term debt  as of december  and  is denominated in us dollars 
our debt has been primarily issued at fixed rates  and as such  interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate shifts 
the impact of a basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in market value of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
a basis point decrease would result in an increase in market value of million and million as of december  and  respectively 

table of contents foreign exchange risk foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments 
it is customary for us to enter into forex contracts in the normal course of business 
these contracts generally require us to net settle the spread between the contracted foreign currency exchange rate and the spot rate on the contract settlement date  which for certain contracts is the average spot rate for the contract period 
as of december   we had forex contracts outstanding in the aggregate notional amount of million  consisting of million in australian dollars  million in brazilian reais  million in british pounds sterling  million in mexican pesos and million in norwegian kroner 
these contracts generally settle monthly through july at december   we have presented the fair value of our outstanding forex contracts as a current asset of million in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a current liability of million in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets included in item of this report
