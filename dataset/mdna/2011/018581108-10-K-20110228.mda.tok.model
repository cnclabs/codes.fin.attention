loyaltyone 
the loyaltyone segment generates revenue primarily from our coalition loyalty program in canada and  as such  the segment can be impacted by changes in the foreign currency exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar 
in our air miles reward program  we primarily collect fees from our clients based on the number of air miles reward miles issued and  in limited circumstances  the number of air miles reward miles redeemed 
all of the fees collected for air miles reward miles issued are deferred and recognized over time 
air miles reward miles issued and air miles reward miles redeemed are the two primary drivers of loyaltyone revenue and indicators of the success of the program 
these two drivers are also important in the revenue recognition process 
air miles reward miles issued the number of air miles reward miles issued reflects the buying activity of the collectors at our participating sponsors  who pay us a fee per air miles reward mile issued 
the fees collected from sponsors for the issuance of air miles reward miles represent future revenue and earnings for us 
the service element consists of marketing and administrative services provided to sponsors 
revenue related to the service element is determined using the residual method in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc   revenue recognition multiple element arrangements 
it is initially deferred and then amortized pro rata over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile  or a period of months  beginning with the issuance of the air miles reward mile and ending upon its expected redemption 
air miles reward miles redeemed redemptions show that collectors are redeeming air miles reward miles to collect the rewards that are offered through our programs  which is an indicator of the success of the program 
we recognize revenue from the redemptions of air miles reward miles by collectors 
the revenue related to the redemption element is deferred until the collector redeems the air miles reward miles or over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile in the case of air miles reward miles that we estimate will go unused by the collector base or breakage 
we currently estimate breakage to be of air miles reward miles issued 
our estimated breakage changed from approximately one third to effective june  see note  deferred revenue  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
there have been no changes to management s estimate of the life of an air miles reward mile in the periods presented 
the number of air miles reward miles issued impacts the number of future air miles reward miles available to be redeemed 
this can also impact our future revenue recognized with respect to the number of air miles reward miles redeemed and the amount of breakage for those air miles reward miles expected to go unredeemed 
breakage and the life of an air miles reward mile are based on management s estimate after viewing and analyzing various historical trends including vintage analysis  current run rates and other pertinent factors  such as the impact of macroeconomic factors and changes in the program structure 
in the fourth quarter of  the air miles reward program implemented the expiration of inactive accounts  closing such accounts when no air miles reward miles are collected  redeemed or transferred for consecutive months 
the estimated life of an air miles reward mile and breakage are actively monitored and subject to external influences that may cause actual performance to differ from estimates 
loyaltyone has an approximate partnership interest in an entity operating a brazilian coalition loyalty program 
the program is in the process of securing long term agreements with select major sponsors  while preparing for a national rollout in epsilon 
the epsilon segment is a leader in providing integrated direct marketing solutions that combine database marketing technology and analytics with a broad range of direct marketing services 
epsilon has over clients  primarily in the financial services  specialty retail  hospitality and pharmaceutical end markets 
private label services and credit 
the private label services and credit segment provides risk management solutions  account origination  funding services  transaction processing  customer care and collection services for our more than private label retail and co branded credit card programs 
private label services and credit primarily generates revenue generates revenue from finance charges and late fees as well as other servicing fees 
we focus our sales efforts on prime borrowers and do not target sub prime borrowers 
additionally  economic trends can impact this segment 

index private label credit sales and average credit card receivables are the two primary drivers of revenue for this segment 
private label credit sales this represents the dollar value of private label credit card sales that occur at our clients point of sale terminals or through catalogs or web sites 
generally  we are paid a percentage of these sales  referred to as merchant discount  from the retailers that utilize our program 
private label credit sales typically lead to higher portfolio balances as cardholders finance their purchases through our credit card banks 
average credit card receivables this represents the average balance of outstanding receivables from our cardholders at the beginning of each month during the period in question 
customers are assessed a finance charge based on their outstanding balance at the end of a billing cycle 
there are many factors that drive the outstanding balances  such as payment rates  charge offs  recoveries and delinquencies 
management actively monitors all of these factors 
corporate other 
this includes corporate overhead which is not allocated to our segments  as well as all other immaterial businesses

in december  we completed a long term contract renewal with canada safeway limited  a subsidiary of safeway  inc and a sponsor in the air miles reward program since the coalition s inception in accounting treatment for securitizations in june  the fasb issued guidance codified in asc  transfers and servicing  related to accounting for transfers of financial assets and asc  consolidation  related to the consolidation of variable interest entities 
asc removes the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity  or qspe  and eliminates the consolidation exception that was available for qspes 
it was effective for financial asset transfers on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after november  and early adoption was prohibited 
asc requires an initial evaluation as well as an ongoing assessment of our involvement with the operations of the wfn trusts and the wfc trust and our rights or obligations to receive benefits or absorb losses of these credit card securitization trusts that could be potentially significant in order to determine whether those entities will be required to be consolidated on the balance sheet of wfnnb  wfcb or their affiliates  including us 

index the assessment of the wfn trusts and the wfc trust under asc and asc resulted in the consolidation of the credit card securitization trusts on the balance sheet of wfnnb  wfcb or their affiliates  including us  beginning january  based on the carrying amounts of the trust assets and liabilities as prescribed by asc  we recorded a billion increase in assets  including billion to loan loss reserves  an increase in liabilities of billion and a billion reduction in stockholders equity 
after adoption  our consolidated statements of income no longer reflect securitization income  but instead reflect finance charges and certain other income associated with the securitized credit card receivables 
net charge offs associated with credit card receivables impact our provision for loan loss reflected in our total operating expenses 
interest expense associated with debt issued from the trusts to third party investors is reported in securitization funding costs 
additionally  we no longer record initial gains on new securitization activity since securitized credit card loans no longer receive sale accounting treatment  nor are there any gains or losses on the revaluation of the interest only strip receivable  as that asset is not recognized in a transaction accounted for as a secured borrowing 
since our securitization transactions are accounted for under the new accounting rules as secured borrowings rather than asset sales  the cash flows from these transactions are presented as cash flows from financing activities rather than cash flows from operating or investing activities 
after adoption of the new standards  regulatory capital amounts and ratios exceeded well capitalized minimum standards 
we are prepared to provide capital support  if necessary  to support growth plans 
should support be required  regardless of form  we do not expect that it will require us to raise new capital or limit our stock repurchase program and other growth initiatives 
see note  change in accounting principle and note  credit card receivables of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies that are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our judgments and estimates in determination of our financial condition and operating results 
estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements and  accordingly  actual results could differ from these estimates  sometimes materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require management s most subjective judgments 
the most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
allowance for loan loss 
management evaluates its allowance for loan loss monthly for adequacy 
the allowance is maintained through an adjustment to the provision for loan loss 
in estimating the inherent loan losses in the credit card portfolio  we utilize a migration analysis of delinquent and current credit card receivables 
migration analysis is a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a credit card receivable will progress through the various stages of delinquency and to charge off 
the migration analysis considers uncollectible principal  interest and fees reflected in credit card receivables 
in determining the proper level of the allowance for loan loss  management also considers factors that may impact loan loss experience  including seasoning  loan volume and amounts  payment rates and forecasting uncertainties 
if management used different assumptions in estimating incurred net losses  the impact to the allowance for loan could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
for example  a basis point change in management s estimate of incurred net loan losses could have resulted in a change of approximately million in the allowance for loan loss at december   with a corresponding change in the provision for loan loss 
air miles reward program 
because management has determined that the earnings process is not complete at the time an air miles reward mile is issued  the recognition of revenue on all fees received based on issuance is deferred 
we allocate the proceeds from issuances of air miles reward miles into two components as follows redemption element 
the redemption element is the larger of the two components 
for this component  we recognize revenue at the time an air miles reward mile is redeemed  or  for those air miles reward miles that we estimate will go unredeemed by the collector base  known as breakage  over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile 
service element 
for this component  which consists of marketing and administrative services provided to sponsors  we recognize revenue pro rata over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile 
under certain of our contracts  a portion of the proceeds is paid to us at the issuance of air miles reward miles and a portion is paid at the time of redemption 
under such contracts the proceeds received at issuance are initially deferred as service revenue and the revenue and earnings are recognized pro rata over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile 
the amount of revenue recognized in a period is subject to the estimated life of an air miles reward mile 
based on our historical analysis  we make a determination as to average life of an air miles reward mile 
the estimated life of an air miles reward mile is months and the breakage rate is subsequent to june  and the breakage rate is approximately one third for previous periods presented 

index breakage and the life of an air miles reward mile are based on management s estimate after viewing and analyzing various historical trends including vintage analysis  current run rates and other pertinent factors  such as the impact of macroeconomic factors and changes in the program structure 
the estimated life of an air miles reward mile and breakage are actively monitored by management and subject to external influences that may cause actual performance to differ from estimates 
as of december   we had  million in deferred revenue related to the air miles reward program that will be recognized in the future 
further information is provided in note  deferred revenue  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted the provisions of  and account for stock based compensation in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions of asc  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized ratably over the requisite service period 
all share based payment awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the awards requisite service periods  which are generally the vesting periods 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we revised our estimated annual forfeiture rate from to in as actual forfeitures have been less than anticipated and recognized an additional million in stock based compensation expense 
we used a binomial lattice option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  the risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we did not issue any options during  and see note  stockholders equity  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the application of asc income taxes 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc  income taxes 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of  and guidance surrounding  income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as such  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of income 
see note  income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional detail on our uncertain tax positions and further information regarding asc legislative and regulatory developments in april  the sec proposed revised rules for asset backed securities offerings  or sec regulation ab ii  that  if adopted  would substantially change the disclosure  reporting and offering process for public and private offerings of asset backed securities  including those offered under our credit card securitization program 
the proposed rules  if adopted in their current form  would  among other things  impose as a condition for the shelf registration of asset backed securities a requirement that the sponsor of the asset backed securities offering hold a minimum of of the nominal amount of each of the tranches sold or transferred to investors or  in the case of revolving master trusts  an originator s interest of a minimum of of the nominal amount of the securitization exposures and not hedge those holdings 
issuers of publicly offered asset backed securities would be required to disclose more information regarding the underlying assets and to file a computer program that demonstrates the effect of the transaction s waterfall of distributions 
in addition  the proposals would alter the safe harbor standards for the private placement of asset backed securities to impose informational requirements similar to those that would apply to registered public offerings of such securities 
the new federal reserve board guidelines on late fees that can be charged by financial institutions became effective on august  in anticipation of the late fee guidelines  we modified cardholder terms to offset the impact of any decline in average late fees charged 
the final guidelines had less impact than initially expected as they provide for a maximum late fee compared to our original expectation of  and late fees to be charged in excess of the maximum for repeat offenses within a six month period 
in response to the final guidelines  we have changed minimum payments and modified late fee structures effective for billing cycles beginning in november on july   the occ approved an application filed by our credit card services bank subsidiary  wfnnb  to change the location of the bank to wilmington  delaware through the merger of the bank with an interim banking association organized under the laws of the united states and located in wilmington  delaware 
wfnnb is a national banking association and a limited purpose credit card bank and is regulated  supervised and examined by the occ  its primary regulator 
wfnnb is also subject to regulation by the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the federal deposit insurance corporation 
neither the name of the bank nor any of its assets  liabilities or contemplated business purposes changed as a result of the merger 
the merger was completed in august 
index on september   the board of the fdic adopted new safe harbors relating to the treatment of securitizations in receivership or conservatorship 
the new safe harbor rules include a grandfathering provision that we believe will allow the credit card securitization trusts used in our securitization program to continue to benefit from the protections under the safe harbor to the same extent as prior securitizations issued by those trusts 
therefore we do not expect the adoption of the new rule to adversely affect our ability to securitize our receivables 
however  because the new safe harbors were recently adopted  participants in the securitization market  including investors in asset backed securities and the rating agencies that rate our asset backed securities  are continuing to evaluate the effect of the new safe harbors 
outlook we expect high single digit growth on consolidated revenue  double digit growth in adjusted ebitda and net income per share  with three segments contributing to the growth in these key metrics 
loyaltyone loyaltyone is expected to report mid single digit revenue and adjusted ebitda growth for the air miles reward program in  with low single digit growth overall in the segment  as the segment expects to incur losses associated with our international expansion 
loyaltyone has a partnership interest in an entity operating a brazilian coalition loyalty program 
the program is in the process of securing long term agreements with select major sponsors  while preparing for a national rollout in air miles reward miles issued during were essentially flat as compared to due to reduced promotional activity in the grocer sector 
in  we expect issuance of air miles reward miles from our existing sponsors will be approximately to greater than with incremental growth coming from the addition of full year rollouts of new sponsors 
in total  we expect mid single digit growth of air miles reward miles issuances for in may  loyaltyone secured a comprehensive long term renewal and expansion agreement with bank of montreal  or bmo  as a sponsor in its air miles reward program  pursuant to which bmo transferred to loyaltyone the responsibility of reserving for costs associated with the redemption of air miles reward miles issued by bmo as a sponsor 
historically  due to the nature of their contractual arrangement  miles issued by bmo have been excluded from our estimate of breakage as bmo had the responsibility of redemption  and therefore  no breakage estimate was required 
however  changing the nature of the agreement required us to include these miles in our analysis  which impacted the redemption rate and our estimate of breakage 
after evaluating the impact of this transaction  we changed our estimate of breakage from approximately one third to 
the change in estimate had no impact on the total redemption liability  but reduced the amount of deferred breakage within the redemption liability that is expected to be recognized over the expected life of the mile 
we received million in cash consideration for the assumption of the liability 
we established a redemption liability for the air miles reward miles expected to be redeemed at the fair value of an air miles reward mile 
the excess consideration received was also deferred as part of the redemption liability and amortized through redemption revenue as these air miles reward miles were redeemed  or approximately months 
the excess consideration was fully amortized as of september  the net result of the transaction the excess consideration less the reduction in deferred breakage was a gain of approximately million 
this excess consideration was deferred and amortized into redemption revenue over approximately months 
the reduction in breakage would have amortized into redemption revenue over months 
this timing difference will have a negative impact to redemption revenue of approximately million in the first half of  but will have no significant impact thereafter 
additionally  although our deferred breakage element continues to build  the growth rate has been impacted by weak issuances in the latter part of and we believe this will negatively impact our redemption revenue 
based on air miles reward mile issuance forecasts  the negative impact of this should moderate by mid epsilon we believe that the outlook for epsilon s business remains strong as the major offerings continue to demonstrate positive momentum 
we expect double digit growth in revenue and adjusted ebitda 
the database digital businesses continue to benefit from strong new client wins 
we also believe that abacus continued growth demonstrates a return to stability in retail and catalog marketing budgets 
this trend suggests a positive economic outlook from these key verticals  which we expect will reinforce the value of data driven roi based marketing strategies in the overall marketing mix 
finally  the dms acquisition has been integrated into our epsilon segment 
dms provides proprietary data driven  integrated marketing solutions through two complementary offerings database marketing and hosting  and data services  including us consumer demographic information 
the dms acquisition did not materially benefit earnings in  but is expected to be accretive to earnings in 
index private label services and credit we expect high single digit growth in revenue and moderate growth rates in average credit card receivables  and double digit growth in adjusted ebitda in in  the provisions of the card act necessitated the execution of multiple revisions to our cardholder terms  this impacted both cost and revenues  and also required changes to our minimum payment requirements 
the initial implementation of the new guidelines lowered our average late fee for a portion of the latter half of the year 
in response  we raised minimum payments and modified late fee structures to mitigate the impact 
in  we expect gross yields to be in the mid range 
average receivables grew by for the year ended december  the growth came despite stronger payment levels 
increased payment rates can be attributed to a combination of consumer payment patterns restructuring to pre recessionary levels and  to a lesser extent  the increase in minimum payments required 
while higher payments do put pressure on credit card receivables growth  it is beneficial to delinquency levels 
we expect a to growth in ending credit card receivables as we anticipate signing additional new portfolios in principal charge offs were and the delinquency rate was for the year ended december  this represented a significant improvement from delinquency rates continue to trend downward  and we expect delinquencies to follow typical seasonal trends 
lower delinquency rates should translate into further improvements in our credit losses 
we expect a net charge off rate of approximately for we are encouraged by positive trends in with delinquency rates and principal loss rates expected to improve and with gross yields stabilizing 
use of non gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure equal to income from continuing operations  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  plus stock compensation expense  provision for income taxes  interest expense  net  loss on the sale of assets  merger and other costs  depreciation and other amortization and amortization of purchased intangibles 
we use adjusted ebitda as an integral part of our internal reporting to measure the performance of our reportable segments and to evaluate the performance of our senior management 
adjusted ebitda is considered an important indicator of the operational strength of our businesses 
adjusted ebitda eliminates the uneven effect across all business segments of considerable amounts of non cash depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of certain intangible assets that were recognized in business combinations 
a limitation of this measure  however  is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our businesses 
management evaluates the costs of such tangible and intangible assets  the impact of related impairments  as well as asset sales through other financial measures  such as capital expenditures  investment spending and return on capital and therefore the effects are excluded from adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda also eliminates the non cash effect of stock compensation expense 
stock compensation expense is not included in the measurement of segment adjusted ebitda provided to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocations 
therefore  we believe that adjusted ebitda provides useful information to our investors regarding our performance and overall results of operations 
adjusted ebitda is not intended to be a performance measure that should be regarded as an alternative to  or more meaningful than  either operating income or net income as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
in addition  adjusted ebitda is not intended to represent funds available for dividends  reinvestment or other discretionary uses  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap

index consolidated operating results revenue 
total revenue increased million  or  to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the increase was due to the following transaction 
revenue decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  due to the following factors elimination of servicing fees of million from the wfn trusts and the wfc trust  as a result of the adoption of asc and asc in its capacity as a servicer  each of our respective banks earns a fee from the wfn trusts and the wfc trust  to service and administer its receivables  collect payments  and charge off uncollectible receivables 
upon consolidation of the wfn trusts and the wfc trust  this fee was eliminated  a decrease in merchant fees  which are transaction fees charged to the retailer  of million attributable to increases in royalty payments to our retail clients  as well as a decline in fees earned from our deferred programs  and a decline in transition services revenue of million from agreements associated with the acquirers of our merchant services and utility services businesses  which were no longer in place in these decreases were offset in part by increased air miles reward mile issuance fees of million due to a favorable foreign currency exchange rate and growth in our air miles reward miles issued 
our issuance fees  which consist of marketing and administrative services provided to sponsors  are recognized pro rata over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile 
the average foreign currency exchange rate for the current year period increased to as compared to in the prior year

revenue increased billion to billion for the year ended december  on a conformed presentation  adjusting securitization income for securitization funding costs and credit losses  revenue increased million for the year ended december  the increase was a result of growth in average credit card receivable balances of and an increase in our gross yield from the prior year of basis points 
the increase in gross yield was primarily driven by the change in terms to certain of our credit cardholder agreements that we made in february in anticipation of higher operating costs attributable to the card act 
however  our gross yield was negatively impacted by the federal reserve board guidelines on late fees that can be charged by financial institutions  which became effective august  the initial implementation of the new guidelines lowered our average late fee for a portion of the latter half of the year 
in response  we raised minimum payments and modified late fee structures to mitigate the impact for database marketing fees and direct marketing

asset quality our delinquency and net charge off rates reflect  among other factors  the credit risk of our private label credit card receivables  the average age of our various private label credit card account portfolios  the success of our collection and recovery efforts  and general economic conditions 
delinquencies 
a credit card account is contractually delinquent if we do not receive the minimum payment by the specified due date on the cardholder s statement 
when an account becomes delinquent  we print a message on the cardholder s billing statement requesting payment 
after an account becomes days past due  a proprietary collection scoring algorithm automatically scores the risk of the account becoming further delinquent 
the collection system then recommends a collection strategy for the past due account based on the collection score and account balance and dictates the contact schedule and collections priority for the account 
if we are unable to make a collection after exhausting all in house collection efforts  we engage collection agencies and outside attorneys to continue those efforts 
the following table presents the delinquency trends of our credit card portfolio december  of total december  of total in thousands  except percentages receivables outstanding principal principal receivables balances contractually delinquent to days to days or more days total 
index net charge offs 
our net charge offs include the principal amount of losses from cardholders unwilling or unable to pay their account balances  as well as bankrupt and deceased cardholders  less recoveries and exclude charged off interest and fees and fraud losses 
charged off interest and fees are recorded in finance charges  net while fraud losses are recorded as an expense 
credit card receivables are charged off at the end of the month during which an account becomes days contractually past due  except in the case of customer bankruptcies or death 
credit card receivables associated with customer bankruptcies or death are charged off at the end of each month  subsequent to days after the receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death  but in any case  not later than the day contractual time frame 
the net charge off rate is calculated by dividing net charge offs for the period by the average credit card receivables for the period 
average credit card receivables represent the average balance of the cardholder receivables at the beginning of each month in the years indicated 
the following table presents our net charge offs for the years indicated 
year ended december  in thousands  except percentages average credit card receivables net charge offs of principal receivables net charge offs as a percentage of average credit card receivables age of portfolio

liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
we have historically generated cash flows from operations  although that amount may vary based on fluctuations in working capital 
our operating cash flow is seasonal  with cash utilization peaking at the end of december due to increased activity in our private label services and credit segment related to holiday retail sales 
we generated cash flow from operating activities of million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in operating cash flows was due to increased profitability  as well as non cash charges to income such as an increase of million in the provision for loan loss as a result of the consolidation of the wfn trusts and the wfc trust 
we also generated positive operating cash flow of million from increases in working capital  including the timing of payments for other assets 
in  also impacting cash flow from operations was amounts from the sale of credit card receivable portfolios from the wfn trusts and the wfc trust 
amounts due from the wfn trusts and the wfc trust were included in other assets in and resulted in a use of cash as amounts increased during in  with the consolidation of the wfn trusts and the wfc trust upon the adoption of asc and asc  amounts due from the wfn trusts and the wfc trust were eliminated

adoption of asc and asc the consolidation of the wfn trusts and the wfc trust resulted in million in cash and cash equivalents as of january   which is shown separately from operating  financing and investing activities 
liquidity sources 
in addition to cash generated from operating activities  our primary sources of liquidity include our credit card securitization program  certificates of deposit issued by wfnnb  wfcb  our credit facility and issuances of equity securities 
in addition to our efforts to renew and expand our current facilities  we continue to seek new sources of liquidity 
we have also expanded our brokered certificates of deposit to supplement liquidity for our credit card receivables 
we believe that internally generated funds and other sources of liquidity discussed above will be sufficient to meet working capital needs  capital expenditures  and other business requirements for at least the next months 
securitization program 
since january  we have sold a majority of the credit card receivables originated by wfnnb to wfn credit company  llc and wfn funding company ii  llc  which in turn sold them to the wfn trusts as part of our credit card securitization program 
in september  we initiated a securitization program for the credit card receivables originated by wfcb  selling them to world financial capital credit company  llc which in turn sold them to the wfc trust 
these securitization programs are the primary vehicle through which we finance wfnnb s and wfcb s credit card receivables 
historically  we have used both public and private asset backed securities term transactions as well as private conduit facilities as sources of funding for our credit card receivables 
private conduit facilities have been used to accommodate seasonality needs and to bridge to completion of asset backed securitization transactions 
we have secured and continue to secure the necessary commitments to fund our portfolio of securitized credit card receivables originated by wfnnb and wfcb 
however  certain of these commitments are short term in nature and subject to renewal 
there is not a guarantee that these funding sources  when they mature  will be renewed on similar terms or at all based on recent unsuitable volumes and pricing levels in the asset backed securitization markets 
as of december   the wfn trusts and the wfc trust had approximately billion of securitized credit card receivables 
securitizations require credit enhancements in the form of cash  spread deposits and additional credit card receivables 
the credit enhancement is principally based on the outstanding balances of the series issued by the wfn trusts and the wfc trust and by the performance of the private label credit cards in these credit card securitization trusts 
in march  master trust ii issued million of term asset backed securities to investors

as of december   with the consolidation of the wfn trusts and the wfc trust  million of debt issued by the credit card securitization trusts and retained by us has been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
early amortization events are generally driven by asset performance 
we do not believe it is reasonably likely for an early amortization event to occur due to asset performance 
however  if an early amortization event were declared  the trustee of the particular credit card securitization trust would retain the interest in the receivables along with the excess interest income that would otherwise be paid to our bank subsidiary until the credit card securitization investors were fully repaid 
the occurrence of an early amortization event would significantly limit or negate our ability to securitize additional credit card receivables 
debt certificates of deposit

purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and specifying all significant terms  including the following fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and approximate timing of the transaction 
the purchase obligation amounts disclosed above represent estimates of the minimum for which we are obligated and the time period in which cash outflows will occur 
purchase orders and authorizations to purchase that involve no firm commitment from either party are excluded from the above table 
purchase obligations include purchase commitments under our air miles reward program  minimum payments under support and maintenance contracts and agreements to purchase other goods and services 
we believe that we will have access to sufficient resources to meet these commitments 
inflation and seasonality although we cannot precisely determine the impact of inflation on our operations  we do not believe that we have been significantly affected by inflation 
for the most part  we have relied on operating efficiencies from scale and technology  as well as decreases in technology and communication costs  to offset increased costs of employee compensation and other operating expenses 
our revenues  earnings and cash flows are affected by increased consumer spending patterns leading up to and including the holiday shopping period in the third and fourth quarter and  to a lesser extent  during the first quarter as credit card balances are paid down 

index regulatory matters wfnnb is a national banking association and a limited purpose credit card bank and is regulated  supervised and examined by the occ  its primary regulator 
wfnnb is also subject to regulation by the board of the governors of the federal reserve system and the fdic 
wfnnb is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the occ 
wfcb is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by both the fdic and the state of utah 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 
under the fdic s order approving wfcb s application for deposit insurance  wfcb must meet specific capital ratios and paid in capital minimums and must maintain adequate allowances for loan loss 
if wfcb fails to meet the terms of the fdic s order  the fdic may withdraw insurance coverage from wfcb  and the state of utah may withdraw its approval of wfcb 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  wfnnb must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets and liabilities as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
wfnnb is limited in the amounts that it can pay as dividends to us 
quantitative measures established by regulations to ensure capital adequacy require wfnnb to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier capital to risk weighted assets and of tier capital to average assets 
under the regulations  a well capitalized institution must have a tier capital ratio of at least  a total capital ratio of at least and a leverage ratio of at least and not be subject to a capital directive order 
an adequately capitalized institution must have a tier capital ratio of at least  a total capital ratio of at least and a leverage ratio of at least  but is allowed in some cases 
under these guidelines  wfnnb is considered well capitalized 
as of december   wfnnb s tier capital ratio was  total capital ratio was and leverage ratio was  and wfnnb was not subject to a capital directive order 
on april   wfcb received non disapproval notification for a modification of the original three year business plan 
the letter of non disapproval was issued jointly by the state of utah and the fdic 
wfcb  under the terms of the letter  must maintain total risk based capital equal to or exceeding of total risk based assets and must maintain tier capital to total assets ratio of not less than 
both capital ratios were maintained at or above the indicated levels until the end of the bank s de novo period on november  since  the occ has required wfnnb to have an operating agreement with the occ and the calma with us 
that operating agreement required wfnnb to continue to operate in a manner consistent with its then current practices  regulatory guidelines and applicable law  including those related to affiliate transactions  maintenance of capital and corporate governance 
in august  we entered into the operating agreement with wfnnb and the occ  which required us to enter into both the calma and the calsa with wfnnb 
the operating agreement has not required any changes in wfnnb s operations 
the calma and calsa memorialize our current obligations to ensure that wfnnb remains in compliance with its minimum capital requirements 
on july   the occ approved an application filed by wfnnb to change the location of the bank to wilmington  delaware through the merger of the bank with an interim banking association organized under the laws of the united states and located in wilmington  delaware 
neither the name of the bank nor any of its assets  liabilities or contemplated business purposes changed as a result of the merger 
the merger was completed in august recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update  or asu   multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  which supersedes certain guidance in asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  and requires an entity to allocate arrangement consideration at the inception of an arrangement to all of its deliverables based on their relative selling prices the relative selling price method 
asu eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation in which the undelivered element is measured at its estimated selling price and the delivered element is measured as the residual of the arrangement consideration  and requires the relative selling price method in all circumstances in which an entity recognizes revenue for an arrangement with multiple deliverables subject to asu asu will be effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we have elected to adopt this asu prospectively 
revenue associated with the service element of our air miles reward program is determined using the residual method 
based on the sponsor contracts expected to be renewed or materially modified in  the adoption of asu will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
should one of the air miles reward program top five sponsors materially modify its agreement  it could shift the allocation of deferred revenue between the service element and redemption element 
this change in allocation between the deferred revenue elements could impact the timing of revenue recognition  as the redemption element is recognized as air miles reward miles are redeemed whereas the service element is recognized on a pro rata basis over the estimated life of an air miles reward mile  or months 
in january  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurements and disclosures  which amends asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  to add separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements related to level measurements 
the requirement to provide the level disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of asu for the separate level disclosures will only impact disclosures and will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

index in july  the fasb issued asu  disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses  which amends asc  receivables  to require further disaggregated disclosures that improve financial statement users understanding of the nature of an entity s credit risk associated with its financing receivables and the entity s assessment of that risk in estimating its allowance for credit losses as well as changes in the allowance and the reasons for those changes 
the new and amended disclosures as of the end of a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after december  the adoption of asu only impacted disclosures and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our primary market risks include interest rate risk  credit risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk and redemption reward risk 
interest rate risk 
interest rate risk affects us directly in our lending and borrowing activities 
our total borrowing costs were approximately million for to manage our risk from market interest rates  we actively monitor the interest rates and the interest sensitive components to minimize the impact that changes in interest rates have on the fair value of assets  net income and cash flow 
to achieve this objective  we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates by matching asset and liability repricings and through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements 
in addition  through the wfn trusts and the wfc trust  we enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and treasury locks to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to lock the interest rate on a portion of our variable debt 
we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for trading or other speculative purposes 
the approach we use to quantify interest rate risk is a sensitivity analysis which we believe best reflects the risk inherent in our business 
this approach calculates the impact on pre tax income from an instantaneous and sustained increase in interest rates of 
in  a increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease to fiscal year pre tax income of approximately million 
conversely  a corresponding decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a comparable increase to pre tax income 
our use of this methodology to quantify the market risk of financial instruments should not be construed as an endorsement of its accuracy or the appropriateness of the related assumptions 
credit risk 
we are exposed to credit risk relating to the credit card loans we make to our clients customers 
our credit risk relates to the risk that consumers using the private label credit cards that we issue will not repay their revolving credit card loan balances 
to minimize our risk of credit card loan write offs  we have developed automated proprietary scoring technology and verification procedures to make risk based origination decisions when approving new accountholders  establishing their credit limits and applying our risk based pricing 
we also utilize a proprietary collection scoring algorithm to assess accounts for collections efforts if they become delinquent  after exhausting all in house collection efforts  we may engage collection agencies and outside attorneys to continue those efforts 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and the canadian dollar through our significant canadian operations 
we generally do not hedge any of our net investment exposure in our canadian subsidiary 
a increase in the canadian exchange rate would have resulted in an increase in pre tax income of million as of december  conversely  a corresponding decrease in the exchange rate would result in a comparable decrease to pre tax income 
redemption reward risk 
through our air miles reward program  we are exposed to potentially increasing reward costs associated primarily with travel rewards 
to minimize the risk of rising travel reward costs  we have multi year supply agreements with several canadian  us and international airlines  are seeking new supply agreements with additional airlines  periodically alter the total mix of rewards available to collectors with the introduction of new merchandise rewards  which are typically lower cost per air miles reward mile than air travel  allow collectors to obtain certain travel rewards using a combination of reward miles and cash or cash alone in addition to using air miles reward miles alone  and periodically adjust the number of air miles reward miles required to be redeemed to obtain a reward 

index a increase in the cost of rewards to satisfy redemptions would have resulted in a decrease in pre tax income of million  as of december  conversely  a corresponding decrease in the cost of rewards to satisfy redemptions would result in a comparable increase to pre tax income
