item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for our fiscal years ended april   march   and march  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
overview we derive substantially all of our revenues from the sale of bulk and specialty chemicals to our customers in a wide variety of industries 
we began our operations primarily as a distributor of bulk chemicals with a strong customer focus 
over the years we have maintained the strong customer focus and have expanded our business by increasing our sales of value added specialty chemical products  including repackaging  blending and manufacturing certain products 
in recent years  we significantly expanded the sales of our higher margin blended and manufactured products  including our food grade products 
we expect this specialty chemical portion of our business to continue to grow 
we have continued to invest in growing our business 
on january   we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of vertex chemical corporation vertex  for approximately million 
in addition to the manufacture of sodium hypochlorite bleaches  vertex distributes and provides terminal services for bulk liquid inorganic chemicals  and contract and private label packaging for household chemicals 
we believe the acquisition strengthens our market position in the midwest 
vertex had revenues of approximately million in calendar while vertex s margins have historically been somewhat lower than ours  we expect that the acquisition will be accretive to earnings 
operating results of vertex are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition in this annual report on form k as part of our industrial segment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
in fiscal and fiscal  we invested in two new facilities to expand our ability to service our customers and facilitate growth within our industrial group 
our facility in centralia  illinois began operations in july and primarily serves our food grade products business 
we closed our linden  new jersey food grade production facility in september and transferred these operations to our centralia facility 
also in fiscal  we built a facility in minneapolis  minnesota to handle bulk chemicals sold to pharmaceutical manufacturers 
the total capital expenditures on these two facilities were approximately million through fiscal of which approximately million occurred during fiscal and approximately million occurred in the first six months of fiscal we opened two new branches for our water treatment group in fiscal and one new branch in fiscal and expect to continue to invest in existing and new branches to expand our water treatment group s geographic coverage 
the cost of these branch expansions is not expected to be material 
in addition  we have selectively added route sales personnel to certain existing water treatment group branch offices to spur growth within our existing geographic coverage area 
in february  we agreed to sell our inventory and entered into a marketing agreement regarding the business of our pharmaceutical segment  which provided pharmaceutical chemicals to retail pharmacies and small scale pharmaceutical manufacturers 
the transaction closed in may and we have no significant obligations to fulfill under the agreement 
the results of the pharmaceutical segment have been reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented in this annual report on form k 
our financial performance in fiscal was highlighted by sales from continuing operations of million  a increase from fiscal  gross profit from continuing operations of million or of sales  a million decrease in gross profit dollars from fiscal net cash provided by operating activities of million  and cash and cash equivalents and investments available for sale were million as of the end of fiscal after expending million related to the vertex acquisition during fiscal 
table of contents we seek to maintain relatively constant gross profit dollars on each of our products as the cost of our raw materials increase or decrease 
since we expect that we will continue to experience fluctuations in our raw material costs and resulting prices in the future  we believe that gross profit dollars is the best measure of our profitability from the sale of our products 
if we maintain relatively stable profit dollars on each of our products  our reported gross profit percentage will decrease when the cost of the product increases and will increase when the cost of the product decreases 
we use the last in  first out lifo method of valuing hawkins inventory  which causes the most recent product costs to be recognized in our income statement 
the valuation of lifo inventory for interim periods is based on our estimates of fiscal year end inventory levels and costs 
the lifo inventory valuation method and the resulting cost of sales are consistent with our business practices of pricing to current commodity chemical raw material prices 
our lifo reserve increased by million in fiscal due to rising costs and higher inventory volumes on hand at year end maintained to meet customer requirements during an anticipated flood 
the increased reserve decreased our reported gross profit for the year 
our lifo reserve decreased by million in fiscal due to rapidly declining costs 
this decrease in the reserve increased our reported gross profit in fiscal vertex s inventory cost  which represents approximately of the consolidated first in  first out fifo inventory balance at april   is determined using the fifo method 
our raw material costs fluctuated dramatically during fiscal and fiscal the costs of the majority of our primary raw materials began to increase rapidly and substantially in the first quarter of fiscal due to high demand and  in some cases  constrained supply 
we continued to experience those cost trends through the third quarter of fiscal the costs for these raw materials leveled off in the fourth quarter of fiscal  before declining significantly during fiscal  with the costs at the end of fiscal substantially lower than they were in the at the end of fiscal our raw material costs have been generally increasing throughout fiscal  although they have been significantly more stable than in fiscal years and current raw material costs are at levels significantly below the peak that occurred during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our statement of income as a percentage of sales from period to period fiscal fiscal fiscal sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income investment income income from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations  net of tax net income 
table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal sales sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal  as compared to sales of million for fiscal the sales increase was primarily driven by higher sales of manufactured and specialty chemical products and somewhat higher selling prices for bulk chemicals due to increasing commodity chemical costs 
sales of these bulk products were approximately of sales compared to approximately in the previous year 
additionally  the acquisition of vertex  which closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal  contributed million in revenue 
industrial segment 
industrial segment sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal the sales increase was primarily attributable to higher sales of manufactured and specialty chemical products and somewhat higher selling prices for commodity bulk chemicals due to increased commodity chemical costs 
in addition  vertex revenues of million are included in fiscal industrial segment sales 
water treatment segment 
water treatment segment sales increased million  or  to million for fiscal the sales increase was primarily attributable to increased sales of manufactured and specialty chemical products 
gross profit gross profit was million  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal the lifo method of valuing inventory negatively impacted gross profit by million for fiscal due to increased raw material costs and higher volumes of inventory at year end maintained to meet customer requirements during an anticipated flood 
in the prior year  lifo positively impacted gross profit by million due to decreases in certain raw material costs during that period 
industrial segment 
gross profit for the industrial segment was million  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal competitive pricing pressures and increased operational overhead costs contributed to the lower gross profit levels in the industrial segment 
this group incurred million of overhead costs associated with flood control efforts in the fourth quarter of fiscal these reductions in gross profit were partially offset by higher sales of higher margin manufactured and specialty chemical products 
the lifo method of valuing inventory negatively impacted gross profit in this segment by million in fiscal  as compared to positively impacting gross profit by million in fiscal water treatment segment 
gross profit for the water treatment segment was million  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal the decrease in gross profit dollars was primarily due to competitive pricing pressures and increased operational overhead costs  partially offset by increased sales 
additionally  the lifo method of valuing inventory negatively impacted gross profit in this segment by million in fiscal  as compared to positively impacting gross profit by million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million to million  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal we incurred approximately million in additional expense as a result of the death of john hawkins  our former chief executive officer  through the accelerated vesting of his previously granted performance based restricted stock units and stock options  as well as his retention bonus agreement 
other items driving the increased expenses include acquisition costs of approximately million relating to the vertex acquisition in addition to higher equity incentive plan costs and litigation defense costs 

table of contents operating income operating income was million  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal the decrease in operating income was the result of reduced gross profits and increased sg a expenses 
both reporting segments saw a decline in their gross profit dollars due to competitive pricing pressures and higher operational overhead costs 
both segments were also negatively impacted by the lifo method of valuing inventory in fiscal investment income investment income was million for fiscal and fiscal provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the lower effective tax rate for fiscal was primarily due to increased permanent tax differences  lower taxable income levels and somewhat lower effective state tax rates 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales sales decreased million  or  to million for fiscal  as compared to sales of million for fiscal the sales decrease was primarily driven by lower selling prices for commodity bulk chemicals  including caustic soda  due to lower commodity chemical costs in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
sales of these products were approximately of sales compared to approximately in the previous year 
the decline in bulk chemical sales was partially offset by higher sales of our manufactured and specialty chemical products 
industrial segment 
industrial segment sales decreased million  or  to million for fiscal the sales decrease was primarily attributable to lower selling prices for commodity bulk chemicals due to lower commodity chemical costs in fiscal compared to the prior year 
this was partially offset by higher sales of manufactured and specialty chemical products 
water treatment segment 
water treatment segment sales decreased million  or  to million for fiscal increased sales of manufactured and specialty chemical products were offset by decreases in selling prices for commodity chemicals due to lower commodity chemical costs in fiscal compared to the prior year 
gross profit gross profit was million  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal the lifo method of valuing inventory increased gross profit by million for fiscal due to decreases in certain raw material costs  whereas lifo decreased gross profit by million in the prior year due to increases in certain raw material costs during that period 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily driven by our ability to maintain relatively stable margin dollars on lower selling prices compared to the prior year  in addition to an increase in sales of higher margin manufactured and specialty chemical products and the lifo reserve adjustments 
industrial segment 
gross profit for the industrial segment was million  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal in fiscal  the gross profit dollars were significantly higher than historical levels due to the sale of lower cost inventory on hand during that period of rapidly escalating commodity chemical prices as well as an increase in profits realized on certain products where we had inventory available to meet escalated demand during a period of constrained supply 
by contrast  in fiscal  market conditions returned to levels more in line with our historical experience and  as a result  our gross profit dollars were lower for that period 
increased operational overhead costs  primarily related to the two new facilities  also contributed to the lower gross profit levels in the industrial segment 
the reductions were partially offset by higher profits realized from the sale of manufactured and specialty chemical products 
the increase in gross profit margin as a percent of sales was primarily driven by our ability to maintain relatively stable margin dollars on lower selling prices compared to the prior year 
the lifo method of valuing inventory positively impacted gross profit in this segment by million in fiscal  as compared to negatively impacting gross profit by million in fiscal 
table of contents water treatment segment 
gross profit for the water treatment segment was million  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal the higher gross profit dollars were primarily driven by a favorable product mix change as sales of higher margin manufactured and specialty chemical products increased  and we experienced favorable weather conditions in the first quarter of fiscal as compare to the first quarter of fiscal the increase in gross profit margin as a percent of sales was primarily driven by our ability to maintain relatively stable margin dollars on lower selling prices compared to the prior year 
additionally  the lifo method of valuing inventory positively impacted gross profit in this segment by million in fiscal  as compared to negatively impacting gross profit by million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses were million  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal the increase in sg a expenses was primarily the result of higher equity incentive plan  variable pay plan and medical insurance costs partially offset by lower bad debt expense 
the increase as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of the decrease in sales from fiscal operating income operating income was million  or of sales  for fiscal  as compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal a million increase in operating income for the water treatment segment  which was driven by higher sales volumes for manufactured and specialty chemical products  was partially offset by a million decrease in operating income for the industrial segment 
both segments benefited from the lifo method of valuing inventory in fiscal investment income investment income was million for fiscal and fiscal investment income remained flat year over year primarily due to lower yields on investments as compared to the prior year 
provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the higher effective tax rate for fiscal was primarily due to decreased permanent tax differences that served to reduce the effective tax rate in fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operations in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in net income  fluctuations in working capital balances and lower deferred tax liabilities 
higher working capital balances used million in cash in fiscal whereas lower working capital balances provided million in cash in fiscal the net increase in working capital balances in fiscal was primarily due to increasing commodity chemical costs and the resulting increase in selling prices  which resulted in an increase in trade receivables and inventories partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and income tax payable balance due to the timing of tax payments 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to the fluctuations in working capital balances and increased deferred tax liabilities in fiscal due to the nature of our operations  which includes purchases of large quantities of bulk chemicals  the timing of purchases can result in significant changes in working capital investment and the resulting operating cash flow 
historically  our cash requirements for working capital increase during the period from april through november as caustic soda inventory levels increase as the majority of barges are received during this period 

table of contents cash and investments available for sale of million at april  decreased by million as compared with march   due to the acquisition of vertex  capital expenditures and dividend payments  which were partially offset by cash generated from operations 
investments available for sale as of april  and march  consisted of certificates of deposit with maturities ranging from three months to two years 
capital expenditures capital expenditures were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the total capital expenditures in fiscal for new facilities were approximately million compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
additional significant capital expenditures during fiscal consisted of approximately million for business expansion and process improvement projects  million for other facility improvements and new cylinders  million for regulatory and safety improvements and million for new and replacement route sales trucks for the water treatment segment 
we expect that recurring capital expenditures for storage  facilities improvements  returnable containers  and route sales trucks in fiscal will be comparable with the fiscal spend rate  although we are projecting higher capital spending for business expansion and project improvement processes in fiscal  with total capital spending in fiscal currently projected to be approximately million 
we expect our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures in fiscal dividends during the second quarter of fiscal  our board of directors increased our semi annual cash dividend by to per share from per share 
in addition  due to the company s strong cash position driven by its financial performance in fiscal  the board of directors authorized a special dividend of per share to be paid concurrently with the semi annual regular dividend in october we first started paying cash dividends in and have continued to do so since 
future dividend levels will be dependent upon our results of operations  financial position  cash flows and other factors  and will be evaluated by our board of directors 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table provides aggregate information about our contractual payment obligations and the periods in which payments are due payments due by period more than contractual obligation years total in thousands operating lease obligations critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements  we follow us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we re evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we consider the following policies to involve the most judgment in the preparation of our financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue when there is evidence that the customer has agreed to purchase the product  the price and terms of the sale are fixed  the product has shipped and title passes to our customer  performance has occurred  and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
on a quarterly basis  management assesses the inventory quantities on hand to estimated future usage and sales and  if necessary  writes down to net realizable the value of inventory deemed obsolete or excess 
though management considers these reserves adequate and proper  changes in sales volumes due to unexpected economic or competitive conditions are among the factors that could materially affect the adequacy of this reserve 
lifo reserve inventories  with the exception of vertex inventories  are primarily valued at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined using the lifo method 
we may incur significant fluctuations in our gross margins due primarily to changes in the cost of a single  large volume component of inventory 
the price of this inventory component may fluctuate depending on the balance between supply and demand 
management reviews the lifo reserve on a quarterly basis 
vertex inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined using the fifo method 
impairment of long lived assets we review the recoverability of long lived assets to be held and used  such as property  plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable  such as prolonged industry downturn or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pre tax cash flows undiscounted of the related operations 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset or asset group  an impairment is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived assets 
the measurement of impairment requires us to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of long lived assets 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows 
we periodically review the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of our long lived assets 
changes in these estimates could have a material effect on the assessment of long lived assets subject to amortization 
there were no triggering events that required material assets to be evaluated for impairment during fiscal income taxes in the preparation of our financial statements  management calculates income taxes 
this includes estimating the current tax liability as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and book accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on the balance sheet 
these assets and liabilities are analyzed regularly and management assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established to the extent that management believes that recovery is not likely 
reserves are also established for potential and ongoing audits of federal and state tax issues 
we routinely monitor the potential impact of such situations and believe that it is properly reserved 
valuations related to amounts owed and tax rates could be impacted by changes to tax codes  changes in statutory tax rates  our future taxable income levels and the results of tax audits 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see item  note nature of business and significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding recently adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be adopted in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are subject to the risk inherent in the cyclical nature of commodity chemical prices 
however  we do not currently purchase forward contracts or otherwise engage in hedging activities with respect to the purchase of commodity chemicals 
we attempt to pass changes in material prices on to our customers  however  there are no assurances that we will be able to pass on the increases in the future
