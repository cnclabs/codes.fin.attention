item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s results of operations and financial condition for the years ended june  and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
this report contains certain forward looking statements and information 
the cautionary statements included below and elsewhere in this report should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements wherever they may appear 
our actual future results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
critical accounting estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to 
table of contents make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition revenue on product sales is recognized upon shipment to the customer when risk of loss and title transfer to the customer and all other conditions required by gaap  as promulgated by the financial accounting standards board fasb in accounting standards codification asc section formerly staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  have been satisfied 
returns of our product for credit are minimal  accordingly  we do not establish a reserve for product returns at the time of sale 
warranties certain of our products are sold with a warranty that provides for repairs or replacement of any defective parts for a period  generally one year  after the sale 
at the time of the sale  we accrue an estimate of the cost of providing the warranty based on prior experience with such factors as return rates and repair costs  which factors are reviewed quarterly 
warranty expenses  including changes of estimates  are included in cost of sales in our consolidated income statements 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market value 
reductions to estimated market value are recorded  and charged to cost of sales  when indicated based on a formula that compares on hand quantities to estimated demand over the ensuing months from the measurement date 
accounts receivable trade receivables are stated at their original invoice amounts  less an allowance for doubtful portions of such accounts 
management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on facts and circumstances related to specific accounts  and on historical experience related to the age of accounts 
trade receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible 
recoveries of trade receivables previously reserved are offset against the allowance when received 
long lived assets we review the recoverability of long lived assets  such as property and equipment  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate carrying values may not be recoverable 
in fiscal year  we determined that recovery of the carrying value ascribed to the land and building acquired in the purchase of astromec  inc in was impaired due to the insufficiency of estimated undiscounted future cash flows  and we recorded a charge  amounting to  to write down the carrying value of the land and building to estimated fair value based on then existing market conditions and data related to comparable transactions 

table of contents stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense for all share based awards made to employees and directors 
the fair value of share based awards is estimated at the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model 
the portion that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as compensation cost over the requisite service period using the straight line single option method 
the determination of fair value using the black scholes model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables  including expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  expected dividends and projected employee stock option exercise behavior 
we currently estimate stock price volatility based upon historical activity  with future volatility expected to approximate past volatility 
the expected time to exercise is based on a simplified model of the vesting term of the option plus one half the option life 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities along with net operating loss and tax credit carryovers 
deferred tax assets at june  and consisted primarily of basis differences related to research and development tax credit utilization  intangible assets  accrued expenses and inventories 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and the recoverability of our deferred tax assets 
such determination is based on our historical taxable income  with consideration given to our estimates of future taxable income and the periods over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reduce the net carrying value to an amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
when we establish or reduce the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  the provision for income taxes will increase or decrease  respectively  in the period such determination is made 
at june  and  we maintained a valuation allowance against the entire balance of our deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities 
results of operations results of operations for the fiscal year ended june   compared to the fiscal year ended june  the following table sets forth financial data and the percentage of net sales regarding our financial position and operating results fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses impairment expense research and development costs income loss from operations interest expense and other  net provision benefit for income taxes net income loss 
table of contents net sales in increased  or  to  from  in this increase resulted primarily from growth in medical device sales  which increased  or  primarily from growth in sales to our largest customer which accounted for million of the increase 
sales of motion control products increased  primarily from growth in sales to existing customers 
sales of fractional motors decreased  due primarily to a reduction in sales to our largest customer for such products 
although selective price increases and decreases were implemented in response to market conditions  the majority of the sales growth and declines for each product line is due primarily to changes in sales volume  not the effect of price changes 
sales by major customer type for fiscal years and are summarized as follows year ended june  percentage increase decrease dollars in thousands medical aerospace industrial dental government research and other at june   we had a backlog  including orders for delivery beyond days  of million compared with a backlog of million at june  this increase is attributable primarily to orders from our two largest customers 
gross profit in increased  or  to  from  in as a percentage of sales  gross profit improved three points to in  compared to in the dollar increase in gross profit results from a the increase in the gross profit percentage  and b higher sales volumes  as discussed above 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was due to a a change in mix toward sales of medical device and motion control products at relatively higher margins  b cost savings in warranty repair costs  and c reductions in rework and scrap expense 
selling expenses increased  or  to  in from  in components of this increase included costs of improvements to our website  and increased advertising and trade show participation  the costs of which grew   and  respectively  from to these increases were partially offset by a decrease  amounting to  from to in departmental compensation expense 
general and administrative expenses decreased  or  to  in from  in  due primarily to the non recurring impairment charges related to goodwill  intangible assets and owned real estate  aggregating  recorded in research and development costs in did not change materially from  decreasing  or  to  in from  in as a result of the foregoing  operating income for the year ended june  increased to  compared to an operating loss of  for the corresponding period in 
table of contents net interest expense in was  compared to  in the decrease was due to interest savings in connection with our repayment and retirement  prior to its maturity  of the mortgage collateralized by the land and building we own in carson city  offset by early retirement fees associated with the repayment of the bank term loan with wells fargo bank see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our effective combined federal and state tax rate in was  as compared to a benefit rate in  the difference in rates being primarily attributable to the generation of operating income in as opposed to an operating loss being incurred in the effective tax rate in was lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to changes in net deferred tax credits not resulting in a deferred tax provision in  such changes being fully offset by corresponding changes in the valuation allowance against such net deferred tax debits see critical accounting estimates and judgments income taxes 
as a result of the foregoing  net income for was  or per basic share  and per diluted share  as compared to a net loss for of  or per basic and diluted share 
liquidity and capital resources the following table presents selected financial information as of june  and june  june  cash and cash equivalents working capital cash and cash equivalents  net of bank debt tangible book value per common share number of days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable working capital at june  increased  to  compared to  at june   due primarily to increases in in cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and inventories of   and  respectively  partially offset by an increase in payables and accrued expenses of  all of these increases are consistent with the increased operating activity in  relative to  discussed in the preceding paragraphs of this item net cash provided by operations in was  as compared to  in this decrease was comprised primarily of the aggregate of a an increase in accounts receivable in of  compared to an increase in accounts receivable in of  b an increase in inventories in of  compared to a decrease in inventories in of  and c an increase in payables and accrued expenses of  in  compared to an increase in these account balances in of  all the changes discussed herein are consistent with the increase in sales volume between and  discussed in the preceding paragraphs of this item net cash used in investing activities in was  as compared to  in investing activities consist mainly of capital expenditures for manufacturing equipment which can vary widely as equipment is upgraded or replaced 
net cash used in financing activities in was  as compared to  in this increase is due to our payment  during the period  of the remaining  balance due on the union bank mortgage  fully retiring such indebtedness see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents at june   we had cash and cash equivalents of  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand  together with anticipated cash flows from operations and amounts available under the credit facilities see changes in bank debt and credit facilities included in this item  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for fiscal year potential reduction in large customer orders in december our largest customer informed us that is was in the process of developing  and planned to eventually manufacture  its own surgical devices which are functionally comparable to the products the company currently provides to the customer 
pro dex has been the exclusive manufacturer of these products since they were developed 
as more fully discussed above see description of business under item  this potential reduction in orders from our largest customer could have a material impact on our business 

table of contents changes in bank debt and credit facilities union bank credit facility on february   we entered into a credit facility agreement with union bank that provides for the following a revolving credit line of up to  in borrowing availability  under which no amounts have been borrowed  a non revolving credit line of up to  in borrowing availability for the purchase of equipment  under which no amounts have been borrowed  and a term loan of  of which  was outstanding at june  the maximum amount of borrowing under the revolving credit line is the lesser of a  or b the sum of of eligible domestic accounts receivable  plus the lesser of i  or ii of the eligible raw materials and finished goods inventories 
based on the foregoing  at june  we had the ability to borrow up to the maximum allowed amount of  on the revolving line of credit 
the revolving credit line s terms require monthly interest payments based on borrowed amounts at a floating interest rate  calculated as union bank s reference rate plus an aggregate interest rate of at june  
the line s initial term expires on december   after which it is renewable annually at union bank s option 
should union bank decide not to renew the line  it must give us a day notice of such decision 
the terms of the non revolving credit line  which is to be used for equipment purchases  require monthly interest payments based on borrowed amounts at a floating interest rate  calculated as union bank s reference rate plus an aggregate interest rate of at march  
the line has a one year term  after which amounts outstanding under the line at the end of the term will automatically convert into a three year term loan at a floating interest rate calculated in the same manner as described above with respect to the non revolving credit line 
the terms of the million term loan  the proceeds of which were used to pay off in full the wells fargo term loan described below  require monthly principal payments of  plus interest over its month term 
the term loan bears interest at a floating rate  calculated as union bank s reference rate plus an aggregate interest rate of at june  
all personal property assets of the company collateralize the outstanding borrowings under the union bank credit facility 
the union bank credit facility agreement contains financial covenants that require us to comply with minimum quarterly liquidity and annual profitability thresholds  non financial covenants that include monthly  quarterly and annual reporting requirements  and certain operational restrictions 
at june   we were in compliance with these covenants and requirements 

table of contents wells fargo bank credit facility from november until february   we had a credit facility with wells fargo bank consisting of the following a revolving credit line of up to  in borrowing availability  under which no amounts were outstanding during its term  and a five year term loan with an initial balance of  of which  was outstanding at june  on february   the term loan was paid off in full  as discussed further above 
if borrowings under the credit line were to have exceeded  the maximum amount of borrowing was limited to the lesser of  or of the eligible accounts receivable plus of the eligible inventories 
its terms required monthly interest payments at either i wells fargo s prime rate plus  or ii three month libor plus  at our discretion  based on outstanding borrowings 
the line of credit expired on november  we had been charged an unused credit line fee of per annum payable quarterly on the average balance of the line of credit that was not used 
the term loan had an initial balance of  the borrowings from which were used for construction of tenant improvements in our irvine  california facility 
its terms required monthly principal and interest payments over the month life of the loan  based on outstanding borrowings 
the interest rate was fixed at over the life of the loan 
in connection with the refinancing of the term loan  as discussed further above  we incurred early retirement fees  recognized as interest expense in the accompanying consolidated income statement  amounting to  all assets of the company except our carson city land and building collateralized the outstanding borrowings under the wells fargo credit facility 
there were certain financial and non financial covenants that we were required to meet to be in compliance with the terms of the wells fargo credit facility 
as a result of write offs we recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we were in violation of covenants that were based on month historical profitability computations as of that quarter  and as of the succeeding quarters ended september and december  on october   we were informed by wells fargo that the bank would not renew the revolving credit line  which then expired in conformity with its terms on november  with respect to the covenant violations  wells fargo waived by letter agreements the rights it would have otherwise had as of june and september  as further discussed above  on february   we replaced the wells fargo credit facility  including a refinancing of the term loan  with a credit facility agreement we entered into with union bank 
union bank mortgage in march  we entered into a ten year mortgage with union bank for  the principal balance of the mortgage bore interest at a fixed annual rate of 
payments on the mortgage were  per month based on a year amortization  with the balance of  in principal due on april  the mortgage was collateralized by our carson city land and building 
on september   we paid the remaining  balance due on the union bank mortgage  fully retiring such indebtedness 

table of contents impact of inflation and changing prices the industries in which we compete are labor intensive  often involving personnel with high level technical or sales skills 
wages and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and when shortages in the marketplace occur 
in addition  suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
we have been able to partially offset increases in operating costs by increasing charges  expanding services and implementing cost control measures 
however  our ability to increase prices is limited by competitive market conditions  including international competition in many of our markets 
recent accounting pronouncements in april the fasb issued an accounting standards update to provide guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research or development transactions 
research or development arrangements frequently include payment provisions whereby a portion or all of the consideration is contingent upon milestone events such as achieving a specific result from the research or development efforts 
an entity often recognizes these milestone payments as revenue in their entirety upon achieving the related milestone  commonly referred to as the milestone method 
the provisions of this update became effective for milestones achieved in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after june  in the period subsequent to the effective date of the update  we have not entered into research and development arrangements that would have been included in its scope  thus the update has not had an effect on our financial statements
