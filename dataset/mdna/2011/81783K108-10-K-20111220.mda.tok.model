item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements statements in this discussion and analysis about the company s anticipated financial results and growth  as well as those about the development of its products and markets  are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
these include the risks discussed in item a to this annual report  entitled risk factors  and others discussed in this report 
critical accounting estimates the company significant accounting policies are summarized in note of its consolidated financial statements in this annual report 
while these significant accounting policies impact the company s financial condition and results of operations  certain of these policies require management to use a significant degree of judgment and or make estimates  consistent with generally accepted accounting principles  that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods 
since these are judgments and estimates  they are sensitive to changes in business and economic realities  and events may cause actual operating results to differ materially from the amounts derived from management s estimates and judgments 
the company believes the following represent the most critical accounting judgments and estimates affecting its reported financial condition and results of operations bad debts the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts based on known factors related to the credit risk of each customer and management s judgment about the customer s business 
ten customers account for approximately of the company s sales 
at september   the allowance for bad debts amounted to  which represented of receivables 
because of the company s long term relationships with the majority of its customers  in most cases  the principal bad debt risk to the company arises from the insolvency of a customer rather than its unwillingness to pay 
in addition  in certain cases the company maintains credit insurance covering up to of the amount outstanding from specific customers 
the company also carries out some of its foreign trade  particularly in the far east  using letters of credit 
the company reviews all accounts receivable balances on a regular basis  concentrating on any balances that are more than days overdue  or where there is an identified credit risk with a specific customer 
a decision is taken on a customer by customer basis as to whether a bad debt reserve is considered necessary based on the specific facts and circumstances of each account 
in general  the company would reserve of the receivable  net of any recoverable value added taxes or insurance coverages  for a customer that becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy  and lesser amounts for less imminent defaults 
the company maintains a small bad debt reserve to cover the remaining balances based on historical default percentages 
if the financial condition of any of the company customers is worse than estimated or were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of its ability to make payments  the company s results may be adversely affected and additional allowances may be required 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
inventory costs include materials and overhead  and are relieved from inventory on a first in  first out basis 
the company carries out a significant amount of customization of standard products and also designs and manufactures special products to meet the unique requirements of its customers 
this results in a significant proportion of the company s inventory being customer specific 
the company s reported financial condition includes a provision for estimated slow moving and obsolete inventory that is based on a comparison of inventory levels with forecasted future demand 
such demand is estimated based on many factors  including management judgments  relating to each customer s business and to economic conditions 
the company reviews in detail all significant inventory items with holdings in excess of estimated normal requirements 
it also considers the likely impact of changing technology 
it makes an estimate of the provision for slow moving and obsolete stock on an item by item basis based on a combination of likely usage based on forecasted customer demand  potential sale or scrap value and possible alternative use 
this provision represents the difference between original cost and market value at the end of the financial period 
in cases where there is no estimated future use for the inventory item and there is no estimated scrap or resale value  a provision is recorded 
where the company estimates that only part of the total holding of an inventory item will not be used  or there is an estimated scrap  resale or alternate use value  then a proportionate provision is recorded 
once an item has been written down  it is not subsequently revalued upwards 
the provision for slow moving and obsolete inventories at september  was  or of the original cost of gross inventory 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if product designs change more quickly than forecast  additional inventory write downs may be required  which may have a material adverse impact on reported results 
warranty costs the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while the company engages in product quality programs and processes  the company warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and repair or replacement costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
accordingly  the provision for warranty costs is based upon anticipated in warranty failure rates and estimated costs of repair or replacement 
anticipating product failure rates involves making judgments about the likelihood of defects in materials  design and manufacturing errors  and other factors that are based in part on historical failure rates and trends  but also on management s expertise in engineering and manufacturing 
estimated repair and replacement costs are affected by varying component and labor costs 
should actual product failure rates and repair or replacement costs differ from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required and the company s results may be materially adversely affected 
in the event that the company discovers a product defect that impacts the safety of its products  then a product recall may be necessary  which could involve the company in substantial unanticipated expense significantly in excess of the reserve 
there were no safety related product recalls during the past three years 
goodwill impairment at september   the company s balance sheet reflected  of goodwill relating to the controls business 
the company carries out an assessment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances change  to determine if its goodwill has been impaired 
the assessment is based on three separate methods of valuing the controls business based on expected free cash flows  the market price of the company s stock and an analysis of precedent transactions 
these valuation methods require estimates of future revenues  profits  capital expenditures and working capital requirements which are based on evaluation of historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and industry data 
based on all of these valuation methods  management concluded in that the goodwill had not been impaired 
if  in future periods  the company s results of operations  cash flows or the market price of the company s stock were to decrease significantly  then it may be necessary to record an impairment charge relating to goodwill of up to  pension plan assumptions the company makes a number of assumptions relating to its pension plans in order to measure the financial position of the plans and the net periodic benefit cost 
the most significant assumptions relate to the discount rate  the expected long term return on plan assets and the rate of future compensation increase 
if these assumptions prove to be incorrect then the company may need to record  and may actually incur  additional expense or liabilities relating to the pension plans  which could have a material effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
at september  there was a pension liability on the company s balance sheet of  the company s pension plans are significant relative to the size of the company 
at september   pension plan assets were  plan liabilities were  and the total assets of the company were  in accordance with fasb guidance  changes in the funded status of the pension plans plan assets less plan liabilities are recorded in the company s balance sheet and could have a material effect on the company s financial position 
the funded status of the company s defined benefit pension plans improved from a deficit of  at september  to a deficit of  at september  the reduction in the deficit of  was due to several factors 
the most significant factor was a change in the inflation index used  from the retail prices index to the consumer prices index  to calculate the annual increase in accrued benefits for deferred pension plan members of the uk defined benefit plan 
as a result of this change  the company had a one time decrease in the liability of  net of a tax benefit 
this reduction in the estimated pension liability was partially offset by an actuarial loss of  arising from a reduction in the discount rate of the us pension plan from at september  to at september  the table below sets out the approximate impact on the funded status of the company s pension plans at september  that the company estimates would arise from the following respective changes in significant plan assumptions plan assumption change in assumption favorable unfavorable impact on funded status in thousands of dollars change in funded status assumptions impacting accumulated benefit obligation discount rate inflation rate salary increase mortality rate year income taxes the company s effective tax rate is dependent on many factors  including the impact of enacted tax laws in jurisdictions in which the company operates  the amount of earnings by jurisdiction  varying tax rates in each jurisdiction and the company s ability to utilize foreign tax credits related to foreign taxes paid on foreign earnings that will be remitted to the us the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability approach  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequence of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or income tax returns 
income taxes are recognized during the period in which the underlying transactions are recorded 
deferred taxes are provided for temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities as recorded for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws 
if the company determines that a deferred tax asset arising from temporary differences is not likely to be utilized  the company will establish a valuation allowance against that asset to record it at its expected realizable value 
if the company later determines  based on the weight of available evidence  that the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future  the allowance may be reversed in whole or in part 
management considers many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of the company s deferred tax assets  including recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction  expectations of future taxable income  the carry forward periods available for tax reporting purposes and other factors 
the range of possible estimates relating to the valuation of the company s deferred tax assets is very wide 
significant judgment is required in making these assessments and it is very difficult to predict when  if ever  management may conclude that any portion of the deferred tax assets is realizable 
as of september   there is a partial valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets 
if future experience is significantly different from that which was projected in making these assessments  there could be significant additional adjustments to the company s deferred tax assets and income tax expense 
the company recognizes uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by relevant taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
although the company believes that its tax positions are appropriate  the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in the underlying estimates 
a results of operations compared to the following table compares the results  for both the controls and capacitor segments  with the prior year  showing separately the percentage variances due to currency exchange rate changes and volume 
in thousands of dollars favorable unfavorable change due to total currency volume sales controls to external customers capacitors to external customers capacitors inter segment capacitors total total sales to external customers gross profit controls capacitors total selling  research and administrative expenses  gain on sale of fixed assets and pension curtailment gain controls capacitors gain on sale of fixed assets pension curtailment gain unallocated corporate expense total operating income controls capacitors unallocated corporate expense total other income and expense income before income taxes income taxes provision benefit net income the company s main customers in the controls segment manufacture electric vehicles for on road  off road and industrial applications  including automotive  construction  distribution  mining  airport ground support and utility applications 
following the significant economic turmoil of and  which led to some of the company s customers experiencing between and reduction in demand for new vehicles  there was a modest recovery in demand for the company s products in and this has continued into the increase in sales in has also been the result of new product introduction which has led to customer gains in on road vehicle applications 
in  sales were  an increase of  or  compared to in  approximately of the company s sales were made outside the united states and were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the euro and the british pound  accordingly  those revenues are subject to fluctuation when translated into us dollars 
in  the average us dollar exchange rate was higher compared to both the british pound and the euro  than in as a result  foreign currency sales denominated in british pounds and euros translated into more us dollars 
the overall impact to was that reported sales increased by  or  due to currency rate changes 
excluding the currency impact  volumes shipped in the controls business segment were  or higher than in volumes shipped were higher in europe and north america by and respectively  but were lower in the far east due largely to lower domestic demand in japan and south korea  compared to the same period last year 
the decrease in demand in japan was due to the impact of the earthquake in and in south korea to the demise of a significant customer in the automotive sector 
the increase in sales volume in europe and north america is in part due to continued customer gains in a range of on road and off road ev applications 
in addition  the company s traditional markets of industrial applications for construction  distribution  mining  airport ground support and utility applications have seen healthy recovery from the significant reduction in customer demand experienced in the recession of with volumes shipped up over last year 
in the capacitor business  reported sales to external customers increased by  or  compared to currency exchange rate changes increased sales by  or and capacitor volumes shipped were  or  higher than last year due principally to higher demand in the railway signaling market and the industrial sector 
cost of sales was  compared to  in  an increase of  as the gross profit percentage in of was broadly the same as in when it was  the increase in cost of sales was principally due to the increase in volumes shipped in compared to the prior year 
foreign currency fluctuations had a net unfavorable impact on gross profit of  this was due to the us dollar being marginally weaker in than in compared with the british pound and the euro  which had a favorable impact on sales of  but an unfavorable impact on cost of sales of  in the controls segment  gross profit of  or  was  or higher than last year which was due to the increase in volumes shipped in compared to last year 
in the capacitor segment gross profit of  was significantly higher than the gross profit of  the gross profit was of sales in compared to of sales in the increase in the capacitor business gross profit percentage was mainly due to an increase in the proportion of sales to higher margin industrial and railway signaling customers 
the table below analyzes the year to year change in sales  cost of sales and gross profit

the increase in selling  research and administrative expenses was due largely to higher salary and fringe costs compared to the same period last year  due to the hiring of additional sales and marketing and engineering staff to support the current and future growth of the business and also the award of a general pay increase in the first quarter of the company received uk government grants of  in the first two quarters of associated with research and development expense of  in the same period 
the grants received were recorded as a reduction of research and development expense in the period 
the company also recorded in selling  research and administrative expenses in  a one time gain of  from the sale of fixed assets which included a gain of  on the sale of a surplus uk facility offset by a  write down of other fixed assets in the business 
an analysis of the year to year change in selling  research and administrative expenses  before gain on sale of fixed assets and pension curtailment gain  is set out below selling  research and administrative expenses  before gain on sale of fixed assets and pension curtailment gain in thousands of dollars reported expense in reported expense in increase in expense increase due to effect of exchange rate changes higher research and sales and marketing expense  net of currency effect higher administrative expense  net of currency effect total increase in selling  research and administrative expenses  before gain on sale of fixed assets in and pension curtailment gain in in the company took the decision to freeze the defined benefit pension plan for us employees effective september  this decreased the projected benefit obligation by  as of september  and as this eliminated all future service for the purposes of benefit accrual  this amendment was treated as a curtailment under financial accounting standards board fasb authoritative guidance 
accordingly  the entire effect of the amendment was recognized as a gain in in the consolidated statement of operations 
there was operating income for the year of  compared to  in  an improvement of  this was due to several factors including the significant increase in sales volumes shipped and the receipt of uk government grants  offset by higher operating expenses 
the controls business reported operating income of  compared to  in operating income in the capacitor business was  compared with  in other income and expense was an expense of  in compared to  of income in the previous year 
the change year on year was largely due to a foreign currency exchange loss of  in  compared to a foreign currency gain of  in interest expense was  which was  higher than the prior year  due to higher borrowing in interest income was  lower at  compared to  in  due to lower average surplus cash balances during compared with income before income taxes in was  compared to income before income taxes of  in  an improvement year on year of  foreign currency fluctuations decreased pre tax income by  in  the pre tax result  before the effect of the favorable currency fluctuations  was  higher than the prior year 
the company recorded a provision for income tax of  or of the pre tax income for the year compared to an income tax benefit of  in the income tax provision of of pre tax income was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate of for several reasons 
there was a net reversal of  of deferred tax valuation allowances in following a review of the company s realizability of its deferred tax assets 
in addition  the company recorded  of additional research and development tax credits arising from the research activity in the company s uk operations 
the reduction in the effective tax rate associated with these items was partly offset by an increased tax charge of  arising from a reduction in the uk tax rate which resulted in a write down in the value of the company s uk deferred tax assets 
the income tax benefit of  in arose largely from  of research and development tax credits in the company s uk operations and  arising from the partial reversal of a deferred tax valuation allowance in the us the company recorded net income after income taxes of  compared to net income after income taxes of  last year  a decrease of  basic and diluted income per share was 
and  respectively  in compared to a basic and diluted income per share of 
in b liquidity and capital resources the company s operating activities used  of cash during compared with cash generated from operating activities for of  acquisitions of property  plant and equipment amounted to  compared to  in and the company received  from the sale of the surplus u 
k facility in the second quarter of the fiscal the company s us subsidiary sevcon usa  inc borrowed  in the third quarter to fund working capital 
exchange rate changes increased cash by  in compared to a decrease of  last year 
at september  the company s cash balances were  compared to  last year 
the main changes in operating assets and liabilities in were an increase in accounts receivable of  and an increase in inventories of  the increase in inventory in is the result of a number of factors 
a large part of the increase was due to the company s decision at the end of the first quarter of not to ship a substantial order for controls to a large public company in the far east that had experienced a substantial deterioration in its financial condition 
this led to a temporary increase in inventory of a current product  finished goods  sub assemblies and raw material  the finished goods element of which shipped to other customers in the fourth quarter of a further cause of the inventory increase has been the continuing global shortage of components and raw materials which has required the company to purchase additional quantities of certain component parts to ensure continuity of supply to our customers 
the company had a uk bank loan of  of which  was short term and  long term debt at september  it has overdraft facilities in the united kingdom amounting to  which were unused as of september  and september  the overdraft facility of the uk capacitor subsidiary is secured by a legal charge over the facility owned and occupied by that company 
the overdraft facility of the uk controls subsidiary is secured by a legal charge over a facility owned by that company 
both facilities were renewed in the second quarter of for a further period of twelve months but  in line with normal practice in europe  can be withdrawn on demand by the bank 
management believes that  if these facilities were withdrawn  adequate alternative credit resources would be available 
however  this would depend on the company s situation and the economic environment at the time 
accordingly  management does not rely on their availability in projecting the adequacy of the company s capital resources 
in june  the company s wholly owned subsidiary  sevcon usa  inc  entered into a  secured revolving credit facility with rbs citizens  national association for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the obligations under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by the company and are secured by all of the assets of sevcon usa  inc and a pledge of all of the capital stock of sevcon usa  inc the facility imposes customary limitations on sevcon usa  inc s ability to  among other things  pay dividends  make distributions  and incur additional indebtedness 
under the facility  sevcon usa  inc must maintain  on a quarterly basis  a debt to tangible net worth ratio of no more than and a debt service coverage ratio of no less than for each rolling twelve month period 
at september   the company was in compliance with these covenants 
upon entering into the revolving credit facility  sevcon usa  inc drew down  which was the total amount outstanding at september  the revolving credit facility will expire on june  when all outstanding principal and unpaid interest will be due and payable in full 
there were no significant capital expenditure commitments at september  the company s capital expenditures are not expected  on average over a two to three year period  to significantly exceed the depreciation charge  which averaged  over the last three years 
it is estimated that the company will make contributions to its uk and us defined benefit pension plans of approximately  in  should the company suffer a material reduction in revenues in this commitment could adversely impact the company s financial position 
in the opinion of management  the company s requirements for working capital to meet projected operational and capital spending needs in both the short and long term can be met by a combination of existing cash resources  future earnings and existing borrowing facilities 
however  the outlook remains uncertain  given the slow recovery in certain geographic markets from the worldwide economic deterioration and fiscal austerity measures in place in some of the company s geographic territories 
any material reduction in revenues will have a materially adverse impact on the company s financial position  which would be exacerbated if any of the company s lenders withdraws or reduces available credit 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash from operations and if the bank overdraft facilities are withdrawn  the company would need to raise additional debt or equity capital from other sources to avoid significantly curtailing its business and materially adversely affecting its results 
c off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet financing or arrangements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s operations are sensitive to a number of market factors  any one of which could materially adversely affect its results of operations in any given year 
foreign currency risk the company sells to customers throughout the industrialized world 
in approximately of the company s sales were made in us dollars  were made in british pounds and were made in euros 
in the controller business the majority of the product is produced in three separate plants in poland  mexico and china and cost of sales is incurred in a combination of british pounds  euros and us dollars 
this resulted in the company s sales and margins being exposed to fluctuations due to the change in the exchange rates of the us dollar  the british pound and the euro 
in addition  the translation of the sales and income of foreign subsidiaries into us dollars is subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company had no foreign currency derivative financial instruments outstanding as of september  the following table provides information about the company s foreign currency accounts receivable  accounts payable and firmly committed sales contracts as of september  the information is provided in us dollar amounts  as presented in the company s consolidated financial statements 
in thousands of dollars expected maturity or transaction date fiscal fair value on balance sheet financial instruments in us functional currency accounts receivable in british pounds accounts receivable in euros accounts payable in british pounds accounts payable in euros anticipated transactions in us functional currency firmly committed sales contracts in british pounds in euros interest rate risk the company currently has  of interest bearing debt related to a uk bank loan for the purchase of capital equipment by the company s uk metalized film capacitor business 
in addition  the company s wholly owned subsidiary  sevcon usa  inc  has  of interest bearing debt related to a secured revolving credit facility which was entered into for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the company invests surplus funds in instruments with maturities of less than months at both fixed and floating interest rates 
the company incurs short term borrowings from time to time on its overdraft facilities in europe at variable interest rates 
due to the short term nature of the company s investments at september  the risk arising from changes in interest rates was not material
