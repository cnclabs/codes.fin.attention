future phase ii development projects include land  shell  underground work and capitalized interest through phase i opening only  ch phase ii project costs includes land  shell and capitalized interest only 
amount capitalized as of december  completion expected during the third quarter of as of february   ch phase ii is pre leased 
the company derives substantially all of its revenue from rents received from tenants under existing leases at each of the operating properties 
because the company believes that critical load is the primary factor used by tenants in evaluating data center requirements  rents are based primarily on the amount of power that is made available to tenants  rather than the amount of space that they occupy 
in  the company executed leases representing megawatts of critical load and  raised square feet of space 
each of the company s leases includes pass through provisions under which tenants are required to pay for their pro rata share of most of the property level operating expenses  such as real estate taxes and insurance commonly referred to as a triple net lease 
in addition  under the company s triple net lease structure  tenants pay for only the power they use and power that is used to cool their space 
the company 
table of contents intends to continue to structure future leases as triple net leases 
the company s leases also provide it with a property management fee based on a percentage of base rent collected and property level operating expenses  other than charges for power used by tenants to run their servers and cool their space 
although most of the company s leases provide for annual escalation of rents  generally at a rate of or a function of the consumer price index  the company s revenue growth in the near term is expected to result primarily from future lease commencements at acc phase ii and nj phase i  which were placed into service on november  acc phase ii and nj phase i were respectively and leased as of february  additionally  under the company s triple net leases  the company receives expense reimbursement from tenants only on space that is leased 
vacant space results in portions of the company s operating expenses being unreimbursed  which in turn negatively impacts revenues and net income 
the amount of rental income generated by the properties in the company s portfolio depends on its ability to maintain the historical lease rates of currently leased space and to re lease space available from leases that expire or are terminated 
the company s operating properties are located in northern virginia  new jersey and suburban chicago  illinois  and one of its development properties is located in santa clara  california 
changes in the conditions of these markets could impact the overall performance of the company s current and future operating properties  and the company s ability to fully lease its properties 
the ability of the company s tenants to fulfill their lease commitments could be impacted by future economic or regional downturns in the markets in which the company operates or downturns in the technology industry 
if these or other conditions cause a tenant to default on its payment or other obligations  the company could elect to terminate the related lease 
nevertheless  if the company cannot attract replacement tenants on similar terms in a timely manner for any leases that are not renewed or are terminated  the company s rental income will be impacted adversely in future periods 
the company s taxable reit subsidiary trs  df technical services  llc  generates revenue by providing certain technical services to the company s tenants on a contract or purchase order basis  which the company refers to as a la carte services 
such services include the installation of circuits  racks  breakers and other tenant requested items 
the trs will generally charge tenants for these services on a cost plus basis 
because the degree of utilization of the trs for these services varies from period to period depending on the needs of the tenants for technical services  the company has limited ability to forecast future revenue from this source 
moreover  as a taxable corporation  the trs is subject to federal  state and local corporate taxes and is not required to distribute its income  if any  to the company for purposes of making additional distributions to dft s stockholders 
because demand for its services is unpredictable  the company anticipates that the trs may retain a significant amount of its cash to fund future operations  and therefore the company does not expect to receive distributions from the trs on a regular basis 
in the current economic environment  certain types of real estate have experienced declines in value 
if this trend were to be experienced by any of the company s data centers  the company may have to write down the value of that data center  which would result in the company recording a charge against earnings 
results of operations this annual report on form k contains stand alone audited and unaudited financial statements and other financial data for each of dft and the operating partnership 
dft is the sole general partner of the operating partnership and  as of december   owned of the partnership interests in the operating partnership  of which approximately is held as general partnership units

this includes base rent of million  tenant recoveries of million  which includes our property management fee  and other revenue of million  primarily from a la carte projects for our tenants performed by our trs 
this compares to revenue of million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  was due to the lease up of ch phase i and acc phase i  and the opening of acc phase ii and nj phase i in november  partially offset by a decrease in revenue from a la carte services provided to the tenants on a non recurring basis due to a lower volume of a la carte projects 
these projects include the purchase and installation of circuits  racks  breakers and other tenant requested items 
also offsetting the increase in revenue is a million reduction in due to energy costs savings from the company s participation in load management and rate setting programs 
these energy savings  while a reduction of revenue to the company  represent a direct reduction of property operating costs as well  due to the triple net lease structure in place with tenants 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  was primarily due to the following million of increased operating costs as acc  ch phase i and acc phase i matured in their operations and acc phase ii and nj phase i were opened in november which was partially offset by the decrease in energy costs discussed above  million increase of depreciation and amortization resulting from a full year of depreciation and amortization of acc phase i and two months of depreciation and amortization in from acc phase ii and nj phase i  million of increased general and administrative expenses primarily for compensation partially offset by a decrease of million of other expenses for non recurring tenant projects

we did not incur any such loss in net income attributable to common shares 
net income attributable to common shares for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million was primarily due to the discontinuance of cash flow hedge in  higher operating income primarily due to the lease up of acc phase i and ch phase i  partially offset by higher interest expense and million of preferred stock dividends related to the million of preferred stock issued in october

this development not only requires the company to make substantial capital investments  but also increases its operating expenses  which impacts its cash flows from operations negatively until leases are executed and the company begins to collect cash rents from these leases 
in addition  because dft has elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes  dft is required to distribute at least of its taxable income to its stockholders annually

critical accounting policies the company has provided a summary of its significant accounting policies in note to its financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the 
table of contents reporting period 
the company s actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company describes below those accounting policies that it deems critical and requires material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on its financial condition and results of operations 
the company s management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis  based upon information currently available and on various assumptions management believes are reasonable as of the date hereof 
revenue recognition 
rental income is recognized using the straight line method over the terms of the tenant leases  which commences when control of the space and the critical power have been provided to the tenant 
deferred rent included in the company s consolidated balance sheets represents the aggregate excess of rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual rental payments that will be recognized under the remaining terms of the leases 
the company s leases contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse it for a portion of property operating expenses it incurs 
such reimbursements are recognized in the period that the expenses are incurred 
the company recognizes amortization of the value of acquired above market tenant leases as a reduction of rental revenue and of below market leases as an increase to rental revenue 
the company must make subjective estimates as to when its revenue is earned  including a determination of the lease commencement date for accounting purposes  the existence of lease inducements and early termination clauses with penalty payments and the collectability of its accounts receivable related to rent  deferred rent  expense reimbursements and other income 
the company analyzes individual accounts receivable and historical bad debts  tenant concentrations  tenant creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts 
these estimates have a direct impact on net income because a higher bad debt allowance would result in lower net income  and recognizing rental revenue as earned in one period versus another would result in higher or lower net income for a particular period 
capitalization of costs 
the company capitalizes direct and indirect costs related to construction and development  including property taxes  insurance and financing costs relating to properties under development 
in addition  the company ceases cost capitalization after a development is placed in service and a certificate of occupancy is obtained  or if a project is temporarily suspended 
the company capitalizes pre acquisition costs related to probable property acquisitions 
the selection of costs to capitalize and the determination of whether a proposed acquisition is probable are subjective and depends on many assumptions including the timing of potential acquisitions and the probability that future acquisitions occur 
variations in these assumptions would yield different amounts of capitalized costs in the periods presented 
all capital improvements for the income producing properties that extend the property s useful life are capitalized 
useful lives of assets 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of the major components of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to its investments in real estate 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income 
the following presents the major components of the company s properties and the useful lives over which they are depreciated 
component average of total component life years land n a building improvements electrical structure power distribution units electrical structure uninterrupted power supply electrical structure switchgear transformers fire protection security systems mechanical structure heating  ventilating and air conditioning mechanical structure chiller pumps building automation mechanical structure chilled water storage and pipes total weighted average life 
table of contents the company regularly performs preventive maintenance on its data center components to ensure continual operation and avoid downtime at its data centers 
these maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and included as property operating costs in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
the company s triple net leases provide for the reimbursement of the tenant s share of these costs and the reimbursements are included as recoveries from tenants on the company s consolidated statement of operations 
asset impairment evaluation 
the company reviews the carrying value of its net real estate on a quarterly and annual basis 
the company bases its review on an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the real estate investment s use and eventual disposition 
the company considers factors such as future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if the company s evaluation indicates that it may be unable to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment  an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property  which would result in an immediate negative adjustment to net income 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
since cash flows from properties considered to be long lived assets to be held and used are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired  the company s strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss 
if this strategy changes or market conditions dictate an earlier sale date or if the company determines that development of a project is no longer viable  an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material 
if the company determines that impairment has occurred  the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value 
no such impairment losses have been recognized to date 
the company estimates the fair value of rental properties utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis that includes projections of future revenues  expenses and capital improvement costs  similar to the income approach that is commonly utilized by appraisers 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued guidance to significantly amend the consolidation guidance applicable to variable interest entitles vies 
the consolidation model was modified to one based on control and economics  and replaces the current quantitative primary beneficiary analysis with a qualitative analysis 
the primary beneficiary of a vie will be the entity that has i the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie s economic performance and ii the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie 
if multiple unrelated parties share power  as defined  no party will be required to consolidate the vie 
further  the guidance requires continual reconsideration of the primary beneficiary of a vie and adds an additional reconsideration event for determination of whether an entity is a vie 
the amendments also require expanded disclosures related to vies which are largely consistent with the disclosure framework currently applied by the company 
the new guidance was effective january  for the company 
the adoption of this guidance did not impact the company s financial position or results of operations 
funds from operations year ended december  net income depreciation and amortization less non real estate depreciation and amortization ffo funds from operations  or ffo  is used by industry analysts and investors as a supplemental operating performance measure for reits 
the company calculates ffo in accordance with the definition that was 
table of contents adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit 
ffo  as defined by nareit  represents net income determined in accordance with gaap  excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets  plus specified non cash items  such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo per share is calculated on a basis consistent with net income attributable to common shares and op units and reflects adjustments to net income for preferred stock dividends 
the company uses ffo as a supplemental performance measure because  in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions  it provides a performance measure that  when compared year over year  captures trends in occupancy rates  rental rates and operating expenses 
the company also believes that  as a widely recognized measure of the performance of equity reits  ffo will be used by investors as a basis to compare the company s operating performance with that of other reits 
however  because ffo excludes real estate related depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of the company s properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of the company s properties  all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact the company s results from operations  the utility of ffo as a measure of the company s performance is limited 
while ffo is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of equity reits  other equity reits may use different methodologies for calculating ffo and  accordingly  ffo as disclosed by such other reits may not be comparable to the company s ffo 
therefore  the company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of its historical operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated statements of operations 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or to cash flow from operating activities each as computed in accordance with gaap or as an indicator of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to pay dividends or make distributions
