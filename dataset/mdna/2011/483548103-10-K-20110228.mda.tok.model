cash flows provided by operating activities were million for  a decrease of million when compared to the prior year 
our industrial distribution segment had record annual sales of million 
acquisitions completed during the year on december   we acquired global aerosystems  llc global of everett  washington for million 
on april   we acquired minarik corporation minarik of glendale  california for million  the largest acquisition ever completed by our industrial distribution segment 
on april   we acquired allied bearings supply company allied of tulsa  oklahoma for million 
on february   we acquired the assets of fawick de mexico  sa de c 
v 
fawick of mexico city  mexico for million 
key events in december  the us naval air systems command awarded lockheed martin and our aerospace segment a million contract for k max unmanned aircraft systems for a us marine corps evaluation of unmanned cargo resupply in an operational forward deployed environment 
the contract includes the delivery of two k max air vehicles and three remote control ground stations to the us marine corps for a quick reaction assessment  scheduled for summer in november  we issued million in convertible notes 
these notes are due november  and have a coupon rate of 
proceeds from these notes were used to pay down million on our revolving credit facility  make a million voluntary contribution to our qualified pension plan and use million for the purchase of call options related to the convertible note offering 
during the fourth quarter of we were awarded a contract to manufacture new cabins for bell helicopter s ah z attack helicopter 
including potential follow on options  the program value could exceed million and has an initial period of performance that runs thru during the fourth quarter we were awarded a contract from bombardier to build composite doors on the learjet  a new mid sized business jet 
this work will be performed at our uk composite facility 
during the fourth quarter  we recorded a million non cash non tax deductible goodwill impairment charge 
this charge has been included in the operating results of our aerospace segment and was related to our uk composites reporting unit 
during the fourth quarter  we opened a low cost aerospace manufacturing facility in chihuahua  mexico 
during the third quarter we received a payment of million related to the claim for look back interest we filed with the internal revenue service in connection with the australian sh g a super seasprite helicopter program 
this was recorded as interest income during the quarter 
during the third quarter we finalized the negotiations with sikorsky related to the contract price of the canadian mh program resulting in an increase in the contract value from approximately million to approximately million 
because this increase was less than anticipated  we recorded an additional contract loss of million 
during the third quarter we were awarded an add on to option of the jpf program for foreign military sales fms with an additional value of million 
the total value of option is now million 
on september   we replaced our million revolving credit facility with a four year million revolving credit facility 
also  on september   we amended our existing four year term loan 
on september   steven j 
smidler assumed the role of president of the industrial distribution segment  following the retirement of t 
jack cahill on august  in january  the unmanned k max helicopter successfully completed its demonstration for the us marine corps 
the demonstration showed the ability of the unmanned k max to deliver cargo to troops in extreme environments and at high altitudes 
outlook the performance of our industrial distribution segment significantly improved in compared to as the industrial economy improved 
we made three strategic acquisitions that enabled us to grow scale and add new product lines 
with the growth in our base business and the addition of the three acquisitions  the segment achieved a record annual sales level of million 
additionally  the segment improved operating margin during to from in this increase is due to increased sales volume across all markets  higher operating margin on sales contributed by our acquired businesses  and the benefits of cost reduction programs undertaken during this higher operating margin was achieved despite increased pressure on pricing as our customers continue to focus on cost control 
we will continue to emphasize cost reduction  margin improvements and market share gains 
our aerospace segment had solid performance in  despite the technical issues that we encountered in our jpf program  weaker sales of our bearing products  the charge resulting from the resolution of the contract price negotiations related to the sikorsky canadian mh program and the million non cash goodwill impairment charge 
we were able to overcome these challenges by delivering approximately  jpf fuzes in the second half of the year  delivering more than cockpits on our sikorsky black hawk helicopter program and improving margin on our bearing products 
as we look at  we anticipate growth in both of our segments 
our outlook is as follows industrial distribution sales growth of to operating margin between and aerospace sales growth of to operating margin between and corporate expenses in the range of to million per quarter interest expense of approximately million estimated tax rate of in free cash flow in the range of to million 
results of continuing operations consolidated results net sales in thousands industrial distribution aerospace total change change the increase in net sales for as compared to was attributable to an increase in organic sales at our industrial distribution segment  the contribution of sales from our acquisitions and the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates of million  partially offset by a decrease in sales at our aerospace segment 
see segment results of operations and financial condition below for further discussion of segment net sales 
the decrease in net sales for as compared to was attributable to a decline in organic sales at our industrial distribution segment 
this decrease was partially offset by organic sales growth in our aerospace segment and the full year effect of sales from the acquisition of industrial supply corp isc in march  the acquisition of uk composites in june  and the acquisition of industrial rubber mechanics incorporated inrumec in october foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of million on sales for gross profit in thousands gross profit change change of net sales gross profit increased for as compared to due to an increase in gross profit at both our segments 
the increase in industrial distribution gross profit was primarily a result of higher sales volume and the addition of gross profit from the acquisitions completed during the year 
the increase in gross profit at our aerospace segment was primarily due to an increase in gross profit for our jpf program resulting from the improved pricing related to deliveries under option  an increase in gross profit on the sikorsky black hawk helicopter program resulting from an increase in deliveries compared to the prior year and an increase in gross profit on our blade erosion coating programs 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales volume related to our bearing product lines  million in contract losses on the sikorsky canadian mh program  million in losses on our bell helicopter program due to inefficiencies and scrap on our initial production units  reduced gross profit on the c program due to a reduction in volume requirements  a reduction in sales resulting from lower volume on our helicopter after market programs  including egypt sh g e  and million in losses resulting from a reduction in quantities required by our customer for one of our fuze programs 
gross profit decreased in as compared to primarily due to a decrease in gross profit at our industrial distribution segment  partially offset by an increase at our aerospace segment and the full year effect on gross profit from the acquisitions of isc  uk composites and inrumec 
the decrease in gross profit at industrial distribution was a result of lower sales volume  while the increase at aerospace was driven by increased shipments on the sikorsky black hawk helicopter cockpit and jpf programs and increased sales of bearing products for the military markets 
these increases were slightly offset by the absence of gross profit previously generated from australian helicopter support program and decreased sales volume related to our bearing product lines for the commercial and regional business jet markets 
selling  general administrative expenses s  g a in thousands s  g a change change of net sales s  g a increased for as compared to due to an increase in our corporate expenses and an increase in expense at both our segments 
the increase in our corporate expenses was primarily due to million in acquisition related costs 
the higher expense at our industrial distribution segment is attributable to the acquisitions as well as the absence of certain one time benefits related to employee furloughs taken in the prior year and an increase in variable costs such as sales commissions and other employee related costs resulting from the higher sales volume 
the increase in expense at our aerospace segment is due to an increase in legal fees associated with the fmu program litigation matters 
the decrease in s  g a for as compared to is primarily due to tighter cost control leading to expense reductions at both our segments and our corporate office and a reduction in expense for our supplemental employees retirement plan serp 
the expense reductions included furloughs and a reduction in other employee benefit expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by the acquisitions of isc  uk composites and inrumec during and an increase of million in pension expense 
furloughs were taken by our corporate officers and employees at our industrial distribution segment and select operations of our aerospace segment 
goodwill impairment in thousands goodwill impairment during the first quarter of  we were informally notified by a customer of its intent to terminate a contract that had been obtained in our acquisition of uk composites 
we recognized million in sales related to the contract in question during the year ended december  no sales were recognized during the years ended december  or throughout  management worked with this customer to find an acceptable resolution and maintain the work there under 
during the fourth quarter we received a contract termination notice and  as a result  removed all future revenue and related profit associated with this contract from the reporting unit s projections when preparing its annual test for impairment 
we do not believe the termination of the contract will have a significant impact on our liquidity 
this contract loss  in addition to a reduction in revenue for other programs  reduced the revenue and earnings growth forecast to levels below those anticipated at the reporting unit s acquisition in  creating a situation in which step of the impairment analysis resulted in a fair value for the reporting unit below its carrying value 
prior to proceeding to step of the impairment analysis  management assessed the tangible and intangible assets subject to amortization to determine if they were impaired 
based on this analysis these assets were determined not to be impaired 
upon completion of the step impairment analysis  we recorded a non cash non tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of million representing of the total goodwill balance for the reporting unit to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value 
this charge has been included in the operating results of our aerospace segment 
see note  fair value measurements  and note goodwill and intangible assets  net  in the consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies  for further discussion 
during the second quarter of  the aerospace wichita facility lost two of its major contracts and experienced continuing production and quality issues 
as a result  we performed an interim test of goodwill for impairment and recorded a non tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of million 
this represented the entire goodwill balance for the reporting unit 
operating income in thousands operating income change change of net sales the increase in operating income for as compared to was primarily driven by a significant increase in operating income at our industrial distribution segment  offset slightly by a decrease in operating income at our aerospace segment  which includes the million non cash non tax deductible goodwill charge 
see segment results of operations and financial condition below for further discussion of segment operating income 
the decrease in operating income in compared to was primarily driven by a decrease in operating income at our industrial distribution segment and an increase in pension expense offset in part by the absence of the million non tax deductible goodwill impairment charge taken in  a slight increase in aerospace segment organic operating income and the addition of operating income associated with the acquisition of uk composites 
interest expense  net in thousands interest expense  net net interest expense generally consists of interest charged on borrowings and the amortization of capitalized debt issuance costs  offset by interest income 
the decrease in interest expense  net is primarily due to the receipt of million of look back interest during the period  partially offset by an increase in interest expense 
the increase in interest expense is due to higher interest rates on amounts outstanding under our revolving credit agreement  increased amortization of capitalized fees and progressively higher borrowings under the revolving credit agreement as we funded the acquisitions completed in the increase in net interest expense for compared to was primarily due to higher total average bank borrowings and lower interest income  partially offset by lower interest rates in the higher average bank borrowings for was the result of progressively higher borrowings under the revolving credit agreement and term loan agreement as we funded the three acquisitions completed in effective income tax rate effective income tax rate the effective income tax rate represents the combined federal  state and foreign tax effects attributable to pretax earnings for the year 
the increase in the effective tax rate for compared to is due to the non cash non tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of million recorded by the aerospace segment  a non recurring tax benefit for foreign exchange losses incurred in the prior year period as part of an international recapitalization  and from a discrete benefit in the prior year due to certain foreign tax incentives 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for compared to is primarily due to a one time tax benefit for foreign exchange losses incurred as part of an international recapitalization  and from a discrete benefit due to certain foreign tax incentives  as well as the impact of the million non tax deductible non cash goodwill impairment charge taken during the second quarter of other matters information regarding our various environmental remediation activities and the december workplace accident that occurred at one of our uk composites facilities and associated accruals as well as other pending matters can be found in note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
segment results of operations and financial condition industrial distribution segment our strategy the primary strategies for the industrial distribution segment are to expand our geographic footprint in major industrial markets to enhance our position in the competition for regional and national accounts 
in order to increase our geographic footprint  we continue to explore potential acquisition candidates that are consistent with our strategic objectives 
by so doing  we intend to more clearly establish our business as one that can provide comprehensive services to our customers who are continually looking to streamline their procurement operations and consolidate supplier relationships 
gain additional business from existing customers through expanded product and service offerings 
in recent years  we have worked to increase market share in several less cyclical markets including the food and beverage  coal mining and energy industries 
we are also expanding our presence in the power generation and utilities markets  two other less cyclical industries 
we have been successful in this endeavor  as evidenced by our national account wins  and we continue to target these industries 
the acquisitions completed in have allowed us to expand our geographical footprint  provide better levels of support for motion control products and more effectively balance our business between the original equipment manufacturer oem and the maintenance  repair and operations mro markets 
results of operations in thousands net sales change change operating income change change of net sales net sales net sales for increased as compared to due to a increase in organic sales  when measured on a same day sales basis  with the acquisitions contributing million in sales for the decrease in net sales for as compared to is due to a decline of in organic sales when measured on a same day sales basis 
the decrease was partially offset by the addition of sales resulting from the acquisitions of isc and inrumec 
organic sales per day the following represents organic sales per day for the indicated period in thousands for the three months ended december  october  july  april  december  net sales acquisition related sales organic sales sales days organic sales per sales day a change sequential a organic sales per sales day is a metric management uses to evaluate performance trends at its industrial distribution segment and is calculated by taking total organic sales for the quarter divided by the number of sales days during the quarter 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations non gaap financial measures 
organic sales per day grew sequentially over the past four quarters 
the growth in organic sales is due to increases in sales volume to both oem and mro customers and the impact of favorable foreign currency exchange rates for of million 
there were significant increases across all industries  particularly in mining  fabricated metal products and durable goods 
the following represents organic sales per day for the indicated period in thousands for the three months ended december  october  july  april  december  net sales acquisition related sales organic sales sales days organic sales per sales day a change sequential the decrease in organic sales was due to a significant decrease in sales to oems and reduced capital spending by mro customers and changes in foreign currency exchange rates which had an unfavorable impact of million on sales 
by industry there were significant declines in sales in the non metallic mineral products  metal mining  machinery and fabricated metals industries which were partially offset by slight sales increases in the food and beverage and paper industries 
operating income operating income increased in compared to primarily due to the increase in sales volume and the resulting impact on our ability to leverage operating costs  higher rebate income  the addition of million in operating income from the three acquisitions completed in and the benefit of a million decrease in group health insurance expense 
the increases were partially offset by an increase in variable costs such as sales commissions and other employee related costs resulting from the higher sales volume and the absence of the benefit of the one time cost savings of million resulting from the business wide furlough in the second quarter of operating income decreased for as compared to primarily due to the decrease in organic sales volume and the resulting impact on our ability to leverage operating costs 
additionally  operating income was impacted by increases in pension plan expense  employee separation costs and insurance costs 
these factors were partially offset by improved gross margin rates and steps taken by management to reduce operating costs 
these steps included a business wide furlough and the consolidation of branches and the closure of underperforming branches  which resulted in a reduction in headcount 
additionally  we closed the us pension plan to new employees of the industrial distribution segment  effective june  the savings that resulted from the business wide furlough were nonrecurring and although the other actions led to increased costs in the near term  management believes that the long term reduction in operating costs allowed the industrial distribution segment to manage through the economic downturn and emerge as an even more profitable business 
aerospace segment our strategy our strategy for the aerospace segment is to expand our global market position in military and commercial markets  while maintaining leadership in product technical performance and application engineering support  and continuing to concentrate on lean manufacturing techniques and lead time reduction 
results of operations the following table presents selected financial data for our aerospace segment in thousands net sales change change operating income change change of net sales backlog on contract net sales net sales decreased for as compared to due to a decrease in sales volume on bearings products  lower volume on our helicopter after market programs  including the egypt sh g e upgrade program  our k max program and sales of sh g spare parts to new zealand  a reduction in c ship set deliveries due to a reduction in volume requirements and production interruptions at our customer s facility  and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate changes which impacted sales by million 
these decreases were partially offset by higher priced sales on our jpf program to the united states government usg  resulting from the completion of option and the transition to option  which has a higher per fuze price  commercial sales to foreign militaries of the jpf fuze  increased sales volume on our blade erosion coating programs  initial deliveries on our bell helicopter program  and increased sales volume on our sikorsky black hawk helicopter cockpit program 
net sales increased for as compared to due to the incremental contribution of million in sales from the acquisition of uk composites  increased shipments to the usg and foreign military sales fms on the jpf program  increased shipments on the sikorsky black hawk helicopter cockpit program  an increase in volume on our helicopter after market programs  including additional upgrade work on the egypt sh g e helicopter fleet  sh g spare part sales to new zealand  and increased sales of our bearing products for military platforms 
these increases were partially offset by the absence of sales related to the australian helicopter program support center  a decline in sales of our bearings products for business jet platforms  and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates which impacted sales by million  primarily as a result of the strengthening of the us dollar against the pound sterling which unfavorably impacted the current year sales of uk composites 
operating income operating income decreased for as compared to due to the million non cash non tax deductible goodwill charge taken at our uk composites reporting unit  losses resulting from a decrease in the number of required units and program delays on one of our fuze programs  reduced gross profit generated by our bearings products resulting from the lower sales volume noted above  a reduction in gross profit due to a reduction in c ship set volume requirements  losses recorded on our bell helicopter program due to inefficiencies on our initial production units  additional losses recorded on the sikorsky canadian mh helicopter program  as discussed below  and increased selling  general and administrative expenses related to legal fees associated with the fmu program 
these decreases were partially offset by the increased volume on our sikorsky black hawk helicopter cockpit program  increased gross profit on our jpf program due to more favorable pricing on option deliveries  gross profit associated with the higher sales volume of the jpf fuze to commercial customers and an increase in gross profit on our blade erosion coating programs 
operating income increased for when compared to due to the absence of the million non cash  non tax deductible  goodwill impairment charge taken in  increased shipments of higher margin jpf fuzes  the addition of operating income from the acquisition of uk composites  increased sales on the egypt helicopter upgrade program  increased sales of spares to new zealand to support their helicopter fleet  higher production levels of the sikorsky black hawk helicopter cockpit program  and increased sales of bearing products for military platforms 
these increases were partially offset by reduced gross profit generated by our bearing products for commercial platforms resulting from the lower sales volume as noted above 
in  the aerospace segment took measures designed to reduce costs and improve operating performance  such as furloughs at certain operations 
these measures helped improve operating income for the segment  however  the effect of the furloughs in was nonrecurring in nature 
backlog the increase in backlog in compared to is the result of an increase in orders for our bearing products  new usg orders and commercial sales to foreign militaries under our jpf program  as well as the bell helicopter and a programs  which were awarded in  but for which orders were received during the decrease in backlog in compared to is the result of the changes in the buying patterns of our customers during and the impact of certain new programs  a and bell helicopters  which were not fully included in backlog at december  due to the timing of order receipt 
major programs product lines military markets a in  the segment signed a five year requirements contract with boeing for the production of wing control surfaces inboard and outboard flaps  slats and deceleron assemblies for the us air force s a fleet 
initial deliveries under this program began in the third quarter of full rate production is expected to begin in with an average of approximately ship sets per year through during the first quarter of  we received additional work which increased this multiyear program s potential value to over million  however  annual quantities will vary  as they are dependent upon the orders boeing receives from the us air force usaf 
bearings our bearings products are included on military platforms manufactured in north america and europe 
these products are used as original equipment and or specified as replacement parts by the manufacturers 
the most significant portion of our military sales is derived from us military platforms  such as the ah  c and f a aircraft  and sales in europe for the typhoon program 
these products are primarily proprietary self lubricating  ball and roller bearings for aircraft flight controls  turbine engines  and landing gear and driveline couplings for helicopters 
black hawk the sikorsky black hawk helicopter cockpit program involves the manufacture of cockpits including the installation of all wiring harnesses  hydraulic assemblies  control pedals and sticks  seat tracks  pneumatic lines  and the composite structure that holds the windscreen for most models of the black hawk helicopter 
orders placed to date for the program total cockpits 
the total potential value of this program is at least million  with deliveries on current orders continuing through through december   a total of cockpits have been delivered under this contract 
during we experienced production levels higher than those experienced in  with deliveries of cockpits in compared to in we expect to deliver to cockpits in the segment also performs additional subcontract work involving fuselage joining and installation tasks  blade erosion coating and the production of certain mechanical subassemblies for this helicopter program 
during the second quarter of  we delivered the  th black hawk blade on the blade erosion coating program 
c the segment continues production of structural wing subassemblies for the boeing c we received additional orders under this program that will extend our work beyond during we delivered ship sets 
we currently have orders for ship sets to be delivered in and beyond 
egypt sh g e the segment continues work under a program for depot level maintenance and upgrades for nine kaman sh g e helicopters originally delivered to the egyptian government during the s 
this program has a total contract value of approximately million  of which million has been funded through december  fmu joint programmable fuze jpf we manufacture the jpf  an electro mechanical bomb safing and arming device  which allows the settings of a weapon to be programmed in flight 
during we entered into a contract modification with the usg for the award of options  and under our multi option jpf contract 
the modification provides increased unit prices and quantities for these three option buys upon exercise and updates the original contract negotiated in the total value of the option award is approximately million 
during we were awarded option of the jpf program  which includes usg and foreign military sales and has a total value of million 
the total value of jpf contracts awarded by the usg from inception of the program through december  is million 
this value primarily consists of options through under the original contract and various contract modifications 
we expect to continue production under the currently awarded options through during the first half of  we experienced supplied component issues on the jpf program that caused us to halt production 
in cooperation with our supplier and customer  we analyzed  tested and verified the root cause of the acceptance testing failures  which were traced to the performance of a supplied component  and developed a plan for introduction of key product improvements 
upon resolution of these issues  we were able to deliver more than  fuzes during the second half of during this period we completed option shipments and transitioned to option of the program  which has a higher per fuze price 
additionally  these deliveries included commercial sales to foreign militaries 
these sales are part of a larger order  with an approximate value of million 
during these commercial sales totaled million 
we anticipate completing this order in the first quarter of mh the sikorsky canadian mh helicopter program includes the manufacture and assembly of composite tail rotor pylons 
this program has undergone numerous customer directed design changes that caused costs on this program to exceed the originally proposed price for the contract 
during the third quarter of  we finalized the contract price negotiations for this program increasing the contract value from approximately million to approximately million 
although we received additional consideration for this contract  we were not able to recover all the estimated costs at completion and because this increase was less than anticipated  we recorded a million contract loss during the third quarter of to date  we have recorded million in contract losses  and of this amount  million was recorded in us army in december  we signed a million contract with the us army to perform blade erosion coating on up to helicopter blades 
initial deliveries began in the first quarter of and through december  we have delivered blades under this contract 
under all blade erosion coating contracts with the us army  we have delivered blades through december  commercial markets in late  we signed a seven year follow on contract with boeing for the production of fixed wing trailing edge assemblies for the boeing and aircraft 
during  on average we delivered ship sets per month on the boeing platform and ship set per month on the boeing for  we currently estimate deliveries on these programs to be consistent with this multiyear contract has a potential value in excess of million  however  annual quantities will vary  as they are dependent upon the orders boeing receives from its customers 
airbus our uk composites operations provide composite components for many airbus platforms 
the most significant of these are the a  a and a orders for these components are dependent on the customer s build rate 
bearings our bearings products are included on commercial airliners and regional business jets manufactured in north and south america  europe and asia and are used as original equipment and or specified as replacement parts by airlines and aircraft manufacturers 
these products are primarily proprietary self lubricating  ball and roller bearings for aircraft flight controls  turbine engines  and landing gear  and driveline couplings for helicopters 
the most significant portion of our commercial sales is derived from boeing and airbus platforms  such as the boeing   and and the airbus a  a  a and a bell helicopter in september  we were awarded a five year contract with a potential value of million to build composite helicopter blade skins and skin core assemblies for bell helicopter 
under the terms of the contract  we will provide different assemblies for h       and ba aircraft 
all work is being performed at our full service aerospace innovation and manufacturing support center in bloomfield  connecticut 
first article deliveries to bell hurst  texas facility began in late  with full production starting in the first quarter of through december   the total sales value for our deliveries totaled million 
annual quantities for this program will vary  as they are dependent upon the orders bell receives from its customers 
other matters sh g i we continue to dedicate marketing efforts to identify suitable customers for the sh g i aircraft  spare parts and equipment 
numerous foreign governments have expressed various levels of interest in the aircraft and we have received small orders for the spare parts and related equipment 
for a discussion of other matters related to our aerospace segment see note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources discussion and analysis of cash flows we assess liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund working capital and investing and financing activities 
significant factors affecting liquidity include cash flows generated from or used by operating activities  capital expenditures  investments in our business segments and their programs  acquisitions  divestitures  dividends  adequacy of available bank lines of credit  and factors that might otherwise affect the company business and operations generally  as described under the heading risk factors and forward looking statements in item a of part i of this form k 
we continue to rely upon bank financing as an important source of liquidity for our business activities including acquisitions 
we believe this  when combined with cash generated from operating activities  will be sufficient to support our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we may decide to raise additional debt or equity capital to support other business activities including potential future acquisitions 
we anticipate our capital expenditures will be approximately to million in  primarily related to machinery and equipment and information technology infrastructure  including completion of an information technology back up data center 
we anticipate a variety of items will have an impact on our liquidity during the next months  aside from our working capital requirements 
these may include one or more of the matters described in note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  including the fmu litigation and continued legal costs associated with this matter  the revenue sharing arrangement with the commonwealth of australia  the cost of existing environmental remediation matters  required pension and supplemental employees retirement plan serp contributions or the extension of payment terms by our customers 
however  we do not believe any of these matters will lead to a shortage of capital resources or liquidity that would prevent us from continuing with our business operations as expected 
we regularly monitor credit market conditions to identify potential issues that may adversely affect  or provide opportunities for  the securing and or pricing of additional financing  if any  that may be necessary to continue with our growth strategy and finance working capital requirements 
this is evidenced by the replacement of our revolving credit agreement and amendment of our term loan agreement during the third quarter and the issuance of our million convertible notes in november on february   our board of directors approved an amendment to the pension plan that  among other things  closed the pension plan to all new hires on or after march  and changed the benefit calculation for existing employees related to pay and years of service 
specifically  changes in pay will be taken into account for benefit calculation purposes until the end of calendar year  the benefit formula will be improved to use the highest five years out of the last ten years of service up to december   whether consecutive or not  and years of service will continue to be added for purposes of the benefit calculations through december   with no further accumulation for service thereafter except for vesting purposes 
the changes to the pension plan resulted in a net curtailment loss of approximately million 
in addition  our projected benefit obligation was reduced  and the pension plan s funded status improved by million on march  management regularly monitors plan asset performance and the assumptions used in the determination of our benefit obligation  comparing them to actual performance 
we continue to believe the assumptions selected are valid due to the long term nature of our benefit obligation 
on february   our board of directors also authorized certain enhancements to our defined contribution plan including  among other things  an increase in employer matching contributions made to the plan based on each participant s pre tax contributions 
the enhancements became effective january  pursuant to the terms of our revenue sharing agreement with the commonwealth of australia  we will share all proceeds from the resale of the sh g i aircraft  spare parts  and equipment with the commonwealth on a predetermined basis 
total payments of at least million aud must be made to the commonwealth regardless of sales  of which at least million aud must be paid by march additional payments of million aud each must be paid in march of and to the extent that cumulative payments have not yet reached million aud or million aud as of such dates  respectively 
through december   we have made required payments of million aud 
as of that date  the us dollar value of the remaining million aud required payment was million  of which million is due in march in late  we entered into foreign currency exchange contracts that limit the foreign currency risks associated with these required payments 
these contracts will enable us to purchase million aud for million 
a summary of our consolidated cash flows from continuing operations is as follows vs 
vs 
in thousands total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activites financing activities free cash flow a net cash provided by used in operating activities expenditures for property  plant and equipment free cash flow a free cash flow  a non gaap financial measure  is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less expenditures for property plant and equipment  both of which are presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations non gaap financial measures 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased million in compared to  primarily due to the following increased purchases of inventory driven by the increased sales volume at our industrial distribution segment  increases in our accounts receivable balances  increased contributions to the qualified pension plan  and increased tax payments for our industrial distribution segment 
partially offsetting these was the receipt of million of look back interest  pre tax  in the third quarter of net cash used in investing activities increased million in compared to  primarily due to cash used for the purchases of fawick  allied  minarik and global and an increase in capital expenditures to support our information technology infrastructure 
net cash provided by financing activities increased million in compared to primarily due to the issuance of the million convertible notes in november  offset by the purchase of call options on the convertible notes of million 
the proceeds from the convertible debt offering were used to purchase the call options  pay down million of borrowing under the revolving credit agreement and make a million voluntary contribution to our qualified pension plan 
net cash provided by operating activities increased million in compared to  primarily due to the following lower working capital requirements due to lower sales at our industrial distribution segment 
improvements in our inventory procurement and management processes 
continued focus on collections of outstanding receivable balances 
decreased payments of taxes  due to the absence of payments made in related to the sale of our music segment in the fourth quarter of decreased cash outflows associated with incentive compensation in compared to lower serp payments for retiring executives 
net cash used in investing activities decreased million for compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to cash used for acquisitions in net cash provided by financing activities decreased million for compared to in  we had a net repayment under the revolving credit agreement and term loan agreement of million  compared to net proceeds from borrowings under the revolving credit agreement and term loan of million received in the proceeds received in were used to fund our acquisitions 
financing arrangements in november  we issued convertible unsecured notes due on november  in the aggregate principal amount of million in a private placement offering 
these notes bear interest per annum on the principal amount  payable semiannually in arrears on may and november of each year  beginning on may  proceeds from the offering were million  net of fees and expenses  which were capitalized 
the proceeds were used to repay million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit agreement  make a million contribution to our qualified pension plan and pay million for the purchase of call options related to the convertible note offering 
see below for a discussion of the call options 
the notes will mature on november   unless earlier redeemed  purchased by us or converted  and are convertible into cash and  at our election  shares of our common stock based on an initial conversion rate  subject to adjustment  of shares per  principal amount of notes which represents an initial conversion price of approximately per share  in certain circumstances 
the conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in certain circumstances  but will not be adjusted for accrued and unpaid interest 
upon conversion  we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes and pay or deliver cash  shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock  at our election  with respect to any remaining amounts due 
prior to may   the notes are convertible only in the following circumstances during any fiscal quarter commencing after april  and only during any such fiscal quarter  if the last reported sale price of our common stock was greater than or equal to of the applicable conversion price for at least trading days whether or not consecutive in the period of the consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the previous fiscal quarter  upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions  or during the five consecutive business day period following any five consecutive trading day period in which  for each day of that period  the trading price for the notes was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the applicable conversion rate on such trading day 
on and after may   until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date  holders may convert their notes at any time  regardless of the foregoing circumstances 
upon a change in control or termination of trading  holders of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
in connection with the offering  we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with affiliates of the initial purchasers of the notes 
these transactions are intended to reduce the potential dilution to our stockholders upon any future conversion of the notes 
the call options  which cost an aggregate million  were recorded as a reduction of additional paid in capital 
we also entered into warrant transactions concurrently with the offering  pursuant to which we sold warrants to acquire up to approximately million shares of our common stock to the same counterparties that entered into the convertible note hedge transactions 
proceeds received from the issuance of the warrants totaled approximately million and were recorded as an addition to additional paid in capital 
the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions effectively increased the conversion price of the convertible notes to approximately per share of our common stock 
the note payable principal balance at the date of issuance of million was bifurcated into the debt component of million and the equity component of million 
the difference between the note payable principal balance and the value of the debt component is being accreted to interest expense over a period of years 
the debt component was recognized at the present value of associated cash flows discounted using a discount rate  the borrowing rate at the date of issuance for a similar debt instrument without a conversion feature 
we recorded million of debt issuance costs as on offset to additional paid in capital 
the balance  million  will be amortized over the term of the notes 
on september   we entered into a four year million amended and restated revolving credit agreement with co lead arrangers bank of america securities llc  jp morgan securities llc  and rbs citizens na and a syndicate of lenders revolving credit agreement  which replaced our existing million senior revolving credit facility which was due to expire on september  the former revolving credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement includes an accordion feature that allows us to increase the aggregate amount available to million  subject to additional commitments from lenders 
the revolving credit agreement may be used for working capital  letters of credit and other general corporate purposes  including acquisitions 
on september   we entered into the second amended and restated term loan credit agreement  which was originally entered into on october  and amended and restated on september  term loan agreement 
the term loan agreement  which is in addition to the revolving credit agreement  is a million facility with a four year term 
principal payments of million are due quarterly  starting in the third quarter of  with million of the initial aggregate principal payable in the final quarter 
we may increase the term loan  by up to an aggregate of million with additional commitments from the banks or new commitments from acceptable financial institutions 
as of december   million was outstanding on the term loan agreement 
as of december   million was outstanding on the former term loan agreement 
interest rates on amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement and the term loan agreement are variable  and are determined based on the consolidated senior secured leverage ratio 
at december   the interest rate for the outstanding amounts on both the revolving credit agreement and term loan agreement was 
in addition  the company is required to pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused revolving loan commitment amount at a rate ranging from to per annum  based on the consolidated senior secured leverage ratio 
fees for outstanding letters of credit range from to  based on the consolidated senior secured leverage ratio 
the financial covenants associated with the revolving credit agreement and term loan agreement include a requirement that i the ratio of consolidated senior secured indebtedness to consolidated ebitda  as defined in the revolving credit agreement  cannot be greater than to  ii the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated ebitda  as defined in the revolving credit agreement  cannot be greater than to  and iii the ratio of consolidated ebitda  as defined in the revolving credit agreement  to the sum of a all interest  premium payments  debt discounts  fees  charges and related expenses and b the portion of rent expense under capital leases that is treated as interest expense cannot be less than to 
we were in compliance with those financial covenants as of and for the quarter ended december   and we do not anticipate noncompliance in the foreseeable future 
total average bank borrowings during the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  as of december   there was million available for borrowing under the revolving credit agreement  net of letters of credit 
letters of credit are generally considered borrowings for purposes of the revolving credit agreement 
a total of million in letters of credit was outstanding under the revolving credit agreement at december   million of which was related to the guaranteed minimum payments to australia in connection with the ownership transfer of the sh g a helicopters along with spare parts and associated equipment 
the letter of credit balance will be reduced upon payment of the first of the guaranteed minimum payments to australia in march we incurred million in debt issuance costs in connection with the revolving credit agreement and term loan agreement amendments 
these costs have been capitalized and will be amortized over the term of the facility 
we incurred million in debt issuance costs in connection with the convertible notes 
these costs have been capitalized and will be amortized over the term of the notes 
total amortization expense for the year ended december  was million  including the million write off of capitalized fees related to the former revolving credit agreement 
total amortization expense for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively during the first quarter of  we entered into interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of hedging our eight quarterly variable rate interest payments on the term loan agreement due in and these interest rate swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges and are intended to manage interest rate risk associated with our variable rate borrowings and minimize the negative impact on our earnings and cash flows of interest rate fluctuations attributable to changes in libor rates 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of additional interest expense associated with the interest rate swap agreements 
other sources uses of capital we expect to contribute million to the qualified pension plan and million to the serp for the plan year 
for the plan year  we contributed million to the qualified pension plan  million of which was voluntary  and million to the serp 
during  we contractually committed to spend million for acquisitions 
through december   we have paid million  with the remaining million relating to holdback provisions and debt of the acquired businesses that we have assumed 
these acquisitions  fawick  allied  minarik and global  closed on february   april   april  and december   respectively 
fawick  allied and minarik are included in our industrial distribution segment  while global is included in our aerospace segment 
we anticipate that we will continue to identify and evaluate potential acquisition candidates  the purchase of which may require the use of additional capital 
in november  our board of directors approved a replenishment of our stock repurchase program  providing for repurchase of an aggregate million common shares for use in administration of our stock plans and for general corporate purposes 
there were no shares repurchased during or under this program 
at december   approximately million shares were authorized for repurchase under this program 
on june   we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission sec 
this shelf registration statement allows us to offer  issue or sell from time to time  together or separately  i senior or subordinated debt securities  which may be convertible into shares of our common stock  preferred stock or other securities  ii shares of our common stock  iii shares of our preferred stock  which we may issue in one or more series  or iv warrants to purchase our equity or debt securities or other securities 
the total offering price of the securities will not exceed million in the aggregate 
the shelf registration became effective on august  we do not currently have any commitments or intentions to sell securities pursuant to this registration statement 
future offerings thereunder  if any  will be made only by means of a written prospectus or other permitted documents 
at that time  we will file a prospectus supplement with the sec outlining the type of securities  amounts  prices  use of proceeds and other terms 
we received million from the internal revenue service on july  in response to a claim we filed for look back interest in connection with the australian sh g a super seasprite helicopter program 
the payment was recorded as interest income in the third quarter of look back interest is the mechanism under the us tax law whereby a taxpayer receives or pays interest on the difference between the actual tax taken into account each year under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting  and the hypothetical tax that would have been taken into account using the actual contract revenues and costs instead of estimates 
non gaap financial measures management believes that the non gaap generally accepted accounting principles measures used in this report on form k provide investors with important perspectives into our ongoing business performance 
we do not intend for the information to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures 
other companies may define the measures differently 
we define the non gaap measures used in this report and other disclosures  as follows organic sales per sales day organic sales per sales day is defined as gaap net sales from the industrial distribution segment less sales derived from acquisitions divided by the number of sales days in a given period 
sales days are the number of business days that the industrial distribution segment s branch locations were open for business and exclude weekends and holidays 
management believes sales per sales day provides investors with an important perspective on how net sales may be impacted by the number of days the segment is open for business 
management uses sales per sales day as a measurement to compare periods in which the numbers of sales days differ 
free cash flow free cash flow is defined as gaap net cash provided by used in operating activities less expenditures for property  plant equipment 
management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for dividends to shareholders  debt repayment  and acquisitions after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long term value creation 
free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it excludes certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt 
management uses free cash flow internally to assess both business performance and overall liquidity 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations the following table summarizes certain of the company s contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in millions contractual obligations total within year years years more than years long term debt convertible notes interest payments on debt a operating leases purchase obligations b other long term obligations c planned funding of pension and serp d payments to the commonwealth of australia e total note for more information refer to note  debt short term borrowing and long term debt  note  commitments and contingencies  note  other long term liabilities  note  pension plans  and note  income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
a interest payments on debt are calculated based on the applicable rate and payment dates for each instruments 
for variable rate instruments  interest rates and payment dates are based on management s estimate of the most likely scenarios for each relevant debt instrument 
b this category includes purchase commitments to suppliers for materials and supplies as part of the ordinary course of business  consulting arrangements and support services 
only obligations in the amount of at least  are included 
c this category includes obligations under the company long term incentive plan  deferred compensation plan  a supplemental disability income arrangement for one former company officer and unrecognized tax benefits 
d this category includes planned funding of the company s serp and qualified defined benefit pension plan 
projected funding for the qualified defined benefit pension plan beyond one year has not been included as there are several significant factors  such as the future market value of plan assets and projected investment return rates  which could cause actual funding requirements to differ materially from projected funding 
e pursuant to the terms of our revenue sharing agreement with the commonwealth of australia  we will share all proceeds from the resale of the sh g i aircraft  spare parts  and equipment with the commonwealth on a predetermined basis 
total payments of at least million aud must be made to the commonwealth regardless of sales  of which at least million aud must be paid by march additional payments of million aud each must be paid in march of and to the extent that cumulative payments have not yet reached million aud and million aud as of such dates  respectively 
through december   we have made required payments of million aud 
as of that date  the us dollar value of the remaining million aud required payment was million  of which million is due in march in late  we entered into foreign currency exchange contracts that limit the foreign currency risks associated with these required payments 
these contracts will enable us to purchase million aud for million 
off balance sheet arrangements the following table summarizes the company s off balance sheet arrangements payments due by period in millions total within year years years more than years acquisition earn out total the obligation to pay earn out amounts depends upon the attainment of specific milestones for kpp orlando  an operation acquired in the company currently maintains million in outstanding standby letters of credit under the revolving credit agreement 
of this amount  million is related to the guaranteed minimum payments to australia in connection with the ownership transfer of the sh g a helicopters along with spare parts and associated equipment 
critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are outlined in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosures based upon historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant 
we are also responsible for evaluating the propriety of our estimates  judgments  and accounting methods as new events occur 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management periodically reviews the company s critical accounting policies  estimates  and judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the most significant areas currently involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
long term contracts methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions for long term aerospace contracts  we generally recognize sales and income based on the percentage of completion method of accounting  which allows for recognition of revenue as work on a contract progresses 
we recognize sales and profit based upon either the cost to cost method  in which sales and profit are recorded based upon the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs to complete the contract  or the units of delivery method  in which sales are recognized as deliveries are made and cost of sales is computed on the basis of the estimated ratio of total cost to total sales 
management performs detailed quarterly reviews of all of our significant long term contracts 
based upon these reviews  we record the effects of adjustments in profit estimates each period 
if at any time management determines that in the case of a particular contract total costs will exceed total contract revenue  we record a provision for the entire anticipated contract loss at that time 
the percentage of completion method requires that we estimate future revenues and costs over the life of a contract 
revenues are estimated based upon the original contract price  with consideration being given to exercised contract options  change orders and in some cases projected customer requirements 
contract costs may be incurred over a period of several years  and the estimation of these costs requires significant judgment based upon the acquired knowledge and experience of program managers  engineers  and financial professionals 
estimated costs are based primarily on anticipated purchase contract terms  historical performance trends  business base and other economic projections 
the complexity of certain programs as well as technical risks and uncertainty as to the future availability of materials and labor resources could affect the company s ability to estimate future contract costs 
while we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in estimates or assumptions used to calculate our long term revenues and costs  estimating the percentage of work complete on certain programs is a complex task 
as a result  changes to these estimates could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
these programs include the sikorsky canadian mh program  the sikorsky black hawk program  the jpf program  the boeing a program  the bell helicopter program and several other programs 
estimating the ultimate total cost of these programs has been challenging due to the complexity of the programs  the increase in production of new programs  the nature of the materials needed to complete these programs  change orders related to the programs and the need to manage our customers expectations 
these programs are an important element in our continuing strategy to increase operating efficiencies and profitability as well as broaden our business base 
management continues to monitor and update program cost estimates quarterly for these contracts 
a significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions the allowance for doubtful accounts represents management s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the receivable balance 
these estimates are based on known past due amounts and historical write off experience  as well as trends and factors impacting the credit risk associated with specific customers 
in an effort to identify adverse trends for trade receivables  we perform ongoing reviews of account balances and the aging of receivables 
amounts are considered past due when payment has not been received within a pre determined time frame based upon the credit terms extended 
for our government and commercial contracts  we evaluate  on an ongoing basis  the amount of recoverable costs 
the recoverability of costs is evaluated on a contract by contract basis based upon historical trends of payments  program viability and the customer s credit worthiness 
write offs are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts only after we have exhausted all collection efforts 
actual write offs and adjustments could differ from the allowance estimates due to unanticipated changes in the business environment as well as factors and risks associated with specific customers 
as of december  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million  respectively 
receivables written off  net of recoveries  in and were million and million  respectively 
currently we do not believe that we have a significant amount of risk relative to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
a change in the allowance would have a million effect on pre tax earnings 
inventory valuation methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have four types of inventory a merchandise for resale  b contracts in process  c other work in process  and d finished goods 
merchandise for resale is stated at the lower of the cost of the inventory or its fair market value 
contracts in process  other work in process and finished goods are valued at production cost comprised of material  labor and overhead  including general and administrative expenses on certain government contracts 
contracts in process  other work in process  and finished goods are reported at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
we include raw material amounts in the contracts in process and other work in process balances 
raw material includes certain general stock materials but primarily relates to purchases that were made in anticipation of specific programs that have not been started as of the balance sheet date 
the total amount of raw material included in these in process amounts was less than of the total inventory balance as of both december  and the process for evaluating inventory obsolescence or market value often requires the company to make subjective judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels  quantities and prices at which such inventory will be sold in the normal course of business 
we adjust our inventory by the difference between the estimated market value and the actual cost of our inventory to arrive at net realizable value 
changes in estimates of future sales volume may necessitate future write downs of inventory value 
based upon a market evaluation performed in we wrote down our k max inventory by million in that year 
the k max inventory balance  consisting of work in process and finished goods  was million as of december  we believe that it is stated at net realizable value  although lack of demand for spare parts in the future could result in additional write downs of the inventory value 
overall  management believes that our inventory is appropriately valued and not subject to further obsolescence in the near term 
on february   we completed the transfer of title to the australian sh g a super seasprite helicopters  including related inventory and equipment 
at december   million of sh g i inventory  formerly sh g a  was included in contracts and other work in process inventory 
we believe there is market potential for these aircraft and we are actively marketing them to interested potential customers  however a significant portion of this inventory will be sold after december   based upon the time needed to market the aircraft and prepare them for sale 
inventory valuation at our industrial distribution segment generally requires less subjective management judgment than the valuation of certain inventory in the aerospace segment 
management reviews the k max inventory balance on an annual basis to determine whether any additional write downs are necessary 
if such a write down were to occur  this could have a significant impact on our operating results 
a write down of the december  inventory balance would have affected pre tax earnings by approximately million in management reviewed the sh g i inventory balance at december  to determine that no write down was necessary 
if such a write down were to occur  this could have a significant impact on our operating results 
a write down of the december  inventory balance would have affected pre tax earnings by approximately million in goodwill and other intangible assets methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions goodwill and certain intangible assets that have indefinite lives are evaluated at least annually for impairment 
all intangible assets are also reviewed for possible impairment whenever changes in conditions indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the annual evaluation is generally performed during the fourth quarter  using forecast information 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
a component of an operating segment is deemed to be a reporting unit if it constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of fair value of the reporting unit as compared to its carrying value 
the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
see note  goodwill and other intangible assets  net  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of the million goodwill impairment charge taken by our uk composites reporting unit 
during  management estimated the fair value of its reporting units by using an income methodology based on management s estimates of forecasted cash flows for each business unit  with those cash flows discounted to present value using rates commensurate with the risks of those cash flows 
in addition  management used a market based valuation method involving analysis of market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for i a group of comparable public companies and ii recent transactions  if any  involving comparable companies 
assumptions used by management were similar to those that would be used by market participants performing valuations of our reporting units 
in management used an income based methodology in the determination of the fair value of the reporting units 
management believes the decision to incorporate a second valuation technique in is appropriate as the market based approach provides additional information that would be available to market participants performing a similar valuation 
in preparing our annual evaluation we used an assumed terminal growth rate of to for our reporting units 
the discount rate utilized to reflect the risk and uncertainty in the financial markets and specifically in our internally developed earnings projections ranged from for our reporting units 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the results of our tests for goodwill impairment 
we do not currently believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in estimates or assumptions used to test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment losses 
a decrease of in our terminal growth rate or an increase of in our discount rate would still result in a fair value calculation exceeding our book value for the reporting units that did not record a goodwill impairment charge in additionally  a decrease in the fair value of these reporting units also would not have resulted in an impairment of goodwill 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 
long term incentive programs methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions the company maintains a stock incentive plan  which provides for share based payment awards  including non statutory stock options  restricted stock  stock appreciation rights  and long term incentive program ltip awards 
we determine the fair value of our non qualified stock option awards at the date of grant using a black scholes model 
we determine the fair value of our restricted share awards at the date of grant using an average of the high and low market price of our stock 
ltip awards provide certain senior executives an opportunity to receive award payments  generally in cash 
for each performance cycle  the company s financial results are compared to the russell indices for the same periods based upon the following a average return on total capital  b earnings per share growth and c total return to shareholders 
no awards will be payable unless the company s performance is at least in the th percentile of the designated indices 
the maximum award is payable if performance reaches the th percentile of the designated indices 
awards for performance between the th and th percentiles are determined by straight line interpolation 
awards will be paid out at at the th percentile 
in order to estimate the liability associated with ltip awards  management must make assumptions as to how our current performance compares to current russell data based upon the russell s historical results 
this analysis is performed on a quarterly basis 
when sufficient russell data for a year is available  which typically will not be until may or june of the following year  management will adjust the liability to reflect its best estimate of the total award 
actual results could differ significantly from management s estimates 
the total estimated liability as of december  was million 
option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price  expected dividend yield  future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
our long term incentive plan requires management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving long term company goals as well as estimate the impact the russell results may have on our accrual 
we do not currently believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to changes in stock based compensation expense that could be material 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used  the stock based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock based compensation 
a change in our stock based compensation expense for the year ended december   would have affected pre tax earnings by approximately million in due to the timing of availability of the russell data  there is a risk that the amount we have recorded as ltip expense could be different from the actual payout 
a percentage point increase in the total performance factor earned for our ltip would result in a reduction of pretax earnings of million 
pension plans methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions we maintain a qualified defined benefit pension  as well as a non qualified supplemental employees retirement plan serp  for certain key executives 
see note  pension plans  in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k for further discussion of these plans 
expenses and liabilities associated with each of these plans are determined based upon actuarial valuations 
integral to these actuarial valuations are a variety of assumptions including expected return on plan assets  discount rate and rate of increase in compensation levels 
we regularly review these assumptions  which are updated at the measurement date  december st 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the impact of differences between actual results and the assumptions are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods  which will affect expense recognized in future periods 
we believe that two assumptions  the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets  are important elements of expense and or liability measurement 
the discount rate represents the interest rate used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension obligation 
for  management reviewed the citigroup pension discount curve and liability index to determine the continued appropriateness of our discount rate assumptions 
this index was designed to provide a market average discount rate to assist plan sponsors in valuing the liabilities associated with postretirement obligations 
additionally  we reviewed the changes in the general level of interest rates since the last measurement date noting that overall rates had decreased when compared with based upon this information  we used a discount rate as of december  for the qualified benefit pension plan 
this rate takes into consideration the participants in our pension plan and the anticipated payment stream as compared to the citigroup index and rounds the results to the nearest fifth basis point 
for the serp  we used the same methodology as the pension plan and derived a discount rate of in for the benefit obligation 
the difference in the discount rates is primarily due to the expected duration of serp payments  which is shorter than the anticipated duration of benefit payments to be made to the average participant in the pension plan 
the qualified defined benefit pension plan and serp used discount rates of and at december   respectively  for purposes of calculating the benefit obligation 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for anticipated benefit payments 
the expected return on assets assumption is developed based upon several factors 
such factors include current and expected target asset allocation  our historical experience of returns by asset class type  a risk premium and an inflation estimate 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension expense in by million 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension expense in by million 
a lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets would increase pension expense 
the expected return on plan assets was at december  a one percentage point increase decrease in the assumed return on pension plan assets assumption would have changed pension expense in by approximately million 
the actual return on pension plan assets during and was significantly higher than our expected rate of return on pension plan assets of 
however  management believes that is still a valid assumption for the expected return on pension plan assets due to the long term nature of our benefit obligations and the likely returns associated with our allocation targets to various investments 
income taxes methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions tax laws in certain of our operating jurisdictions require items to be reported for tax purposes at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements 
one example of such temporary differences is depreciation expense 
other differences are permanent  such as expenses that are never deductible on our tax returns  an example being a charge related to the impairment of goodwill 
temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment is not yet due or the realized tax benefit of expenses we have already reported in our tax returns  but have not yet recognized as expense in our financial statements 
as of december   we had recognized million of net deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances 
the realization of these benefits is dependent in part on future taxable income 
for those foreign countries or us states where the expiration of tax loss or credit carryforwards or the projected operating results indicates that realization is not likely  a valuation allowance is provided 
management believes that sufficient income will be earned in the future to realize deferred income tax assets  net of valuation allowances recorded 
the realization of these deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws or statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
our effective tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was for our effective tax rate is based on expected or reported income or loss  statutory tax rates  and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are valid and defensible  we believe that certain positions may not prevail if challenged 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit or changes in tax legislation 
our effective tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that we consider appropriate 
this rate is then applied to our quarterly operating results 
in the event that there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in our operating results  the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or one time item 
we do not anticipate a significant change in our unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months 
we file tax returns in numerous us and foreign jurisdictions  with returns subject to examination for varying periods  but generally back to and including it is our policy to record interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits as income taxes 
a one percent increase decrease in our tax rate would affect our earnings by million 
environmental costs methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions our operations are subject to environmental regulation by federal  state and local authorities in the united states and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations 
as a result  we have established and update  as necessary  policies relating to environmental standards of performance for our operations worldwide 
when we become aware of an environmental risk  we perform a site study to ascertain the potential magnitude of contamination and the estimated cost of remediation 
this cost is accrued using a reasonable discount factor based on the estimated future cost of remediation 
we continually evaluate the identified environmental issues to ensure the time to complete the remediation and the total cost of remediation are consistent with our initial estimate 
if there is any change in the cost and or timing of remediation  the accrual is adjusted accordingly 
environmental costs are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site  including existing technology  current laws and regulations and prior remediation experience 
liabilities with fixed or readily determinable payment dates are discounted 
we believe that expenditures necessary to comply with the present regulations governing environmental protection will not have a material effect upon our competitive position  consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
at december   amounts accrued for known environmental remediation costs were million 
a change in this accrual could have impacted pre tax earnings by million 
further information about our environmental costs is provided in note  environmental costs  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
derivatives and hedging methodology judgment and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions we use derivatives to manage risks related to foreign exchange  our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries and interest rates 
accounting for derivatives as hedges requires that  at inception and over the term of the arrangement  the hedged item and related derivative meet the requirements for hedge accounting 
the rules and interpretations related to derivative accounting are complex 
if a derivative does not meet the complex requirements established as a prerequisite for hedge accounting  changes in the fair value of the derivative must be reported in earnings rather than as a component of other comprehensive income  without regard to the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
in evaluating whether a particular relationship qualifies for hedge accounting  we first determine whether the relationship meets the strict criteria to qualify for exemption from ongoing effectiveness testing 
for a relationship that does not meet these criteria  we test effectiveness at inception and quarterly thereafter by determining whether changes in the fair value of the derivative offset  within a specified range  changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
if fair value changes fail this test  we discontinue applying hedge accounting to that relationship prospectively 
fair values of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are calculated using internal valuation models incorporating market based assumptions
