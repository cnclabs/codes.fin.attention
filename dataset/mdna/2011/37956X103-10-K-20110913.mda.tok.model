fiscal year ending june item selected financial data our selected consolidated financial data as of and for each of the five years in the period ended june  have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements 
ebitda represents net income before interest income  interest expense  provision benefit for income taxes  and depreciation and amortization expense 
ebitda does not represent cash flows defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and does not necessarily indicate that our cash flows are sufficient to fund all of our cash needs 
we disclose ebitda since it is a financial measure commonly used in our industry 
ebitda facilitates internal comparisons of our historical financial position and operating performance on a more consistent basis  we also use ebitda in measuring performance relative to that of our competitors and in evaluating acquisition opportunities 
ebitda is not meant to be considered a substitute or replacement for net income as prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
we record an order in backlog when we receive a firm contract or purchase order  which identifies product quantities  sales price  service dates and delivery dates 
backlog represents the amount of unrecorded revenue on undelivered orders and services to be provided and a percentage of revenues from sales of products that have been shipped where installation has not been completed and final acceptance has not been received from the customer 
our backlog at any given time is not necessarily indicative of future period revenues

this discussion contains  in addition to historical information  forward looking statements  within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  such as  among others  our dependence on a limited number of contracts for a high percentage of our revenues and a significant reduction in revenues from the government marketplace 
these risks and others are more fully described in the risk factors section and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
overview our business is global and subject to technological and business trends in the telecommunications marketplace 
we derive much of our revenue from the government marketplace and developing countries 
our business is therefore affected by geopolitical developments involving areas of the world in which our customers are located  particularly in developing countries and areas of the world involved in armed conflicts  which directly impacts our military related sector business 
our business may also be affected by the government s budgetary issues and its recent efforts to reduce the national deficit and defense spending  which may have a significant effect on our results of operations 
the products and services we offer include pre engineered products  systems design and integration services  access  hosted  and lifecycle support services 
to provide these products and services  we engineer all the necessary satellite and terrestrial facilities as well as provide the integration services required to implement those facilities 
we also operate and maintain managed networks and provide life cycle support services on an ongoing basis 
our customers generally have network service requirements that include point to point or point to multipoint connections via a hybrid network of satellite and terrestrial facilities 
in addition to the government marketplace  these customers are communications service providers  commercial enterprises and media and content broadcasters 
since our products and services are often sold into areas of the world which do not have fiber optic land based networks  a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from  and are expected to continue to be derived from  developing countries 
these countries carry with them more enhanced risks of doing business than in developed areas of the world  including the possibility of armed conflicts or the risk that more advanced land based telecommunications will be implemented over time  and less developed legal protection for intellectual property 
in the year ended june   of our consolidated revenues and of our services revenues were derived from northrop 
the us government s prime contract with northrop  under which we served as a subcontractor  will expire in february and will be replaced with a prime contract under which we are providing similar services as a subcontractor to another subcontractor 
although the identity of customers and contracts may vary from period to period  we have been  and expect to continue to be  dependent on revenues from a small number of customers or contracts in each period in order to meet our financial goals 
from time to time these customers are located in developing countries or otherwise subject to unusual risks 
as a consequence of the worldwide financial and economic crisis and continuing business downturn that has occurred during the past several years  our customers have reduced and may continue to reduce their budgets for spending on equipment and systems  which has impacted our infrastructure segment revenues  resulting in an operating loss in this segment in the years ended june   and we are also experiencing a shift in our infrastructure business from numerous smaller orders to ones that are larger and include various milestones which affect revenue recognition 
this may result in more significant quarter to quarter shifts in revenues from this segment in the future 
we expect an increase in revenues from this segment in the fiscal as a result of this shift 
our cash provided by operating activities was negatively impacted in fiscal years ended june  and due to the increase in inventories and the payment of accounts payable during the current period 
this increase was the result of inventory purchases related to a significant contract in the infrastructure business which is now expected to be shipped in fiscal we have not recognized certain revenues from this contract as a result of not yet achieving certain contract milestones 
moreover  this contract carries an unusually low margin which will negatively impact our gross margin in fiscal as milestones are reached 
revenues related to contracts for infrastructure solutions and services have been fixed price contracts in a majority of cases 
profitability of such contracts is subject to inherent uncertainties as to the cost of performance 
cost overruns may be incurred as a result of unforeseen obstacles  including both physical conditions and unexpected problems encountered in engineering design and testing 
since our business is frequently concentrated in a limited number of large contracts  a significant cost overrun on any contract could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
revenue and gross margin may also be affected by our recent million contract with a us government agency  which carries a lower margin due to the competitive landscape 
contract costs generally include purchased material  direct labor  overhead and other direct costs 
anticipated contract losses are recognized  as they become known 
costs from infrastructure solutions consist primarily of the costs of purchased materials including shipping and handling costs  direct labor and related overhead expenses  project related travel and living costs and subcontractor costs 
costs from services consist primarily of satellite space segment charges  voice termination costs  network operations expenses and internet connectivity fees 
satellite space segment charges consist of the costs associated with obtaining satellite bandwidth the measure of capacity used in the transmission of services to and from the satellites leased from operators 
network operations expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the operation of the network operations center on a hour a day  seven day a week basis  including personnel and related costs and depreciation 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  travel and living costs for sales and marketing personnel 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related overhead expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist of expenses associated with our management  finance  contract  and administrative functions  as well as amortization of intangible assets 
critical accounting policies certain of our accounting policies require judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
actual results may differ from these judgments under different assumptions or conditions 
our accounting policies that require management to apply significant judgment include revenue recognition infrastructure solutions we recognize revenue for our production type contracts that are sold separately as standard satellite ground segment systems when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the selling price is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured  delivery has occurred and the contractual performance specifications have been met 
our standard satellite ground segment systems produced in connection with these contracts are typically short term less than twelve months in term and manufactured using a standard modular production process 
such systems require less engineering  drafting and design efforts than our long term complex production type projects 
revenue is recognized on our standard satellite ground segment systems upon shipment and acceptance of factory performance testing which is when title transfers to the customer 
the amount of revenues recorded on each standard production type contract is reduced by the customer s contractual holdback amount  which typically requires to of the contract value to be retained by the customer until installation and final acceptance is complete 
the customer generally becomes obligated to pay to of the contract value upon shipment and acceptance of factory performance testing 
installation is not deemed to be essential to the functionality of the system since installation does not require significant changes to the features or capabilities of the equipment  does not require complex software integration and interfacing and we have not experienced any difficulties installing such equipment 
in addition  the customer or other third party vendors can install the equipment 
the estimated value of the installation services is determined by management  which is typically less than the customer s contractual holdback percentage 
if the holdback is less than the estimated value of installation  we will defer recognition of revenues  determined on a contract by contract basis equal to the estimated value of the installation services 
payments received in advance by customers are deferred until shipment and are presented as deferred revenues 
we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones  for our non standard  complex production type contracts for the production of satellite ground segment systems and equipment that are generally integrated into the customer s satellite ground segment network 
the equipment and systems produced in connection with these contracts are typically long term in excess of twelve months in term and require significant customer specific engineering  drafting and design effort in order to effectively integrate all of the customizable earth station equipment into the customer s ground segment network 
these contracts generally have larger contract values  greater economic risks and substantive specific contractual performance requirements due to the engineering and design complexity of such systems and related equipment 
progress payments received in advance by customers are netted against the inventories balance 
the timing of our revenue recognition is primarily driven by achieving shipment  final acceptance or other contractual milestones 
project risks including project complexity  political and economic instability in certain regions in which we operate  export restrictions  tariffs  licenses and other trade barriers which may result in the delay of the achievement of revenue milestones 
a delay in achieving a revenue milestone may negatively impact our results of operations 
costs from infrastructure solutions costs related to our production type contracts and our non standard  complex production type contracts rely on estimates based on total expected contract costs 
typically  these contracts are fixed price projects 
we use estimates of the costs applicable to various elements which we believe are reasonable 
our estimates  are assessed continually during the term of these contracts and costs are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
these estimates are subjective based on management s assessment of project risk 
these risks may include project complexity and political and economic instability in certain regions in which we operate 
revisions in cost estimates are reflected in the period in which they become known 
a significant revision in an estimate may negatively impact our results of operations 
in the event an estimate indicates that a loss will be incurred at completion  we record the loss as it becomes known 
goodwill and other intangibles assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of businesses over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
the amount of goodwill recorded in our balance sheet has significantly increased over the recent past as we have made several acquisitions 
goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually 
the impairment test for goodwill uses a two step approach  which is performed at the reporting unit level 
step one compares the fair value of the reporting unit calculated using a discounted cash flow method to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  there is a potential impairment and step two must be performed 
step two compares the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its implied fair value ie  fair value of the reporting unit less the fair value of the unit s assets and liabilities  including identifiable intangible assets 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  the excess is required to be recorded as an impairment charge 
the impairment test is dependent upon estimated future cash flows of the services segment 
there have been no events during the year ended june  that resulted in the impairment of any goodwill or other intangible assets 
deferred tax assets we regularly estimate our ability to recover deferred income taxes  report such deferred tax assets at the amount that is determined to be more likely than not recoverable  and we have to estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items  such as the timing for recognizing revenue and expenses for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we are required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets  which include net operating loss carry forwards and temporary differences that are expected to be deductible in future years  will be recoverable from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies 
if recovery is not likely  we have to provide a valuation allowance based on our estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions  and the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable 
the provision for current and deferred taxes involves evaluations and judgments of uncertainties in the interpretation of complex tax regulations 
this evaluation considers several factors  including an estimate of the likelihood of generating sufficient taxable income in future periods  the effect of temporary differences  the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities and available tax planning strategies 
at june  and june   we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million and million  respectively which if recognized in the future  would favorably impact our effective tax rate 
we record both accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters  if any  in the provision for income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
at june  and june  we had not accrued any amounts for the potential payment of penalties and interest 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the appropriate vesting period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock 
in addition  judgment is required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates or different key assumptions were used  it could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
as of june  there was approximately million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock based compensation related to the restricted shares and restricted share units 
the cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
as of june  there was approximately  of unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested outstanding stock options 
the cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess the customer s ability to pay based on a number of factors  including our past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
an assessment of the inherent risks in conducting our business with foreign customers is also made since a significant portion of our revenues is international 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate in the future  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories inventories consist primarily of work in progress from costs incurred in connection with specific customer contracts  which are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
in assessing the realizability of inventories  we are required to make estimates of the total contract costs based on the various elements of the work in progress 
it is possible that changes to these estimates could cause a reduction in the net realizable value of our inventories 
valuation of contingent consideration we maintain a liability for contingent consideration related to potential earn out payments to the former shareholders of cc  evocomm and comsource if certain milestones are met 
these amounts are estimated based on a number of factors including likelihood of meeting those milestones based on forecasted results 
we review these estimates and updated forecasts on a quarterly basis and record adjustments as required 
in the year ended june   we recorded expense of approximately million in operating results relating to increases in these estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements on july  the company adopted the accounting pronouncement relating to business combinations  including assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies 
changes for business combination transactions pursuant to this pronouncement include  among others  expensing acquisition related transaction costs as incurred  the recognition of contingent consideration arrangements at their acquisition date fair value and capitalization of in process research and development assets acquired at their acquisition date fair value 
the adoption of this pronouncement resulted in the inclusion of acquisition related costs of  and  in general and administrative expenses in the year ended june  and  respectively 
in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu which updates asc topic  multiple elements arrangements  of the fasb codification 
asu provides new guidance on how to determine if an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting  and if so allows companies to allocate arrangement considerations in a manner more consistent with the economics of the transaction 
asu was effective for the company  for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  the adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations for the year ended june  in january  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu 
asu requires new disclosures regarding transfers in and out of the level and and activity within level fair value measurements and clarifies existing disclosures of inputs and valuation techniques for level and fair value measurements 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosure of activity within level fair value measurements  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those years 
this update did not have a material impact on the company s fair value disclosures 
in april  the fasb issued asu  compensation stock compensation topic effect of denominating the exercise price of a share based payment award in the currency of the market in which the underlying equity security trades a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu 
asu clarifies that a share based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entity s equity securities trades should not be considered to contain a condition that is not a market  performance  or service condition 
therefore  such an award should not be classified as a liability if it otherwise qualifies as equity 
this clarification of existing practice is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december   with early application permitted 
the adoption of this pronouncement will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
results of operations fiscal years ended june  and our consolidated results of operations for the year ended june  include results of comsource  cc and evocomm 
these acquisitions took place on april  and march  for cc and evocomm  respectively  and were not included in the corresponding periods in fiscal  except for four months of results for cc and evocomm 
revenues from services 
revenues from services increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in revenues was due to an increase in our access product line of our managed network service line primarily in the government marketplace along with million of revenue from comsource  cc and evocomm 
revenues from infrastructure solutions 
revenues from infrastructure solutions decreased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in revenues was primarily driven by a decline in bookings of contract orders due to the continued global economic slowdown  which resulted in government and commercial customers and prospects delaying or cancelling projects which affected  in particular  pre engineered systems  as well as the unexpected delay in shipments for a major project 
the company expects a significant portion of these delayed shipments to be made in the next fiscal year 
this project carries a lower than normal margin 
additionally  the company also expects a significant amount of revenues under another large contract with lower than normal margins  due primarily to the competitive climate  to be shipped in the next fiscal year 
due to the current global economic conditions it is currently difficult to assess whether or not future bookings will meet or exceed levels experienced in the past 
costs from services 
costs from services increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  gross margin for services increased to for the fiscal year ended june  compared to for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in the gross margin was primarily driven by an increase in revenue in the government marketplace  which tends to have a higher margin 
the increase in gross margin in the services segment has been a key driver in the increase in our consolidated income from operations 
the future relationship between the revenue and margin growth of our operating segments will depend on a variety of factors  including the timing of major contracts  which are difficult to predict 
costs from infrastructure solutions 
costs from infrastructure solutions decreased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the gross margin from infrastructure solutions remained relatively consistent at for the fiscal year ended june  compared to for the fiscal year ended june  selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was a result of increased proposal activity and marketing efforts in infrastructure  an increase in head count  and net increase of million of expenses incurred at comsource  cc and evocomm 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was principally due to costs associated with the tempo enterprise media platform 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was a result of million of an increase in general and administrative expenses incurred at comsource  cc and evocomm inclusive of an increase of million of amortization of intangibles related to these acquisitions  along with an increase in headcount and stock compensation expense and an increase in the accrual for the company s pay for performance plan  partially offset by a decrease in acquisition costs of million and reduction of foreign currency expense of million compared to previous period due to the settlement of forward contracts to purchase euros includes the combined impact of a million gain in the fiscal year ended june  coupled with a million reduction of expense due to inclusion of million loss recorded in same period last year 
earn out fair value adjustments 
the earn out fair value adjustments are a result of the earn out accrual related to the acquisitions of cc  evocomm and comsource 
the expense in the year end june  includes additional expense recorded due to cc and evocomm performing better than our original forecasts along with a settlement reached for the second twelve month earn out period due to the improved performance 
interest income 
interest income decreased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june   as a result of a decrease in interest rates and a decrease in unrestricted cash balance during the year 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by million  as a result of the issuance of debt on march  related to the acquisition of cc and evocomm and april  related to the acquisition of comsource 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  the provision for income taxes increased as a result of the increase in income before income taxes 
the effective rate was for the fiscal year ended june  compared to for the fiscal year ended june  in addition  the effective rate for the fiscal year ended june  included a net benefit for non recurring tax adjustments which primarily represented research and development tax credits related to fiscal years through the effective rate for fiscal excluding these items was 
the effective rate increased in fiscal due to the earn out fair value adjustment that is not deductible for income tax purposes 
this increase was partially offset by a research and development credit for fiscal  a benefit for the extension of the research and development credit that was enacted in the tax relief act of that is retroactive to january  along with benefits for lower tax rates in certain foreign jurisdictions 
fiscal years ended june  and our consolidated results of operations for the year ended june  include results of mach  telaurus  cc  and evocomm four month of results are included in fiscal for cc and evocomm following the acquisition on march  
these acquisitions took place on february   may   and march  for cc and evocomm  respectively  and were not included in the corresponding periods in fiscal  except for four months of results for mach and one month of telaurus 
revenues from services 
revenues from services increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in revenues was due to million of revenue from mach  telaurus  cc and evocomm along with an increase in our access product line of our managed network service line primarily in the government marketplace 
revenues from infrastructure solutions 
revenues from infrastructure solutions increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in revenue was due to the timing of revenue milestones reached in the system design and integration offering offset by a decrease in revenue in pre engineered systems primarily driven by a decline in bookings of contract orders due to the global economic slowdown  which resulted in government and commercial customers and prospects delaying or cancelling projects which  in particular affected pre engineered systems

costs from infrastructure solutions 
costs from infrastructure solutions increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the gross margin from infrastructure solutions increased to for the fiscal year ended june  compared to for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in gross margin was mainly attributable to product mix  specifically the increase in margin in the government marketplace 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was primarily a result of marketing expenses of million incurred at mach  telaurus  cc and evocomm  partially offset by a decrease in salary and salary related expenses and other marketing expenses due to previous cost savings initiatives 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was principally due to costs associated with expanding x and ka band product capabilities  along with research and development costs of million at telaurus 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was a result of million of general and administrative expenses incurred at mach  telaurus  cc and evocomm inclusive of an increase of million of amortization of intangibles related to these acquisitions  acquisition related costs of approximately million  an increase in the pay for performance plan based on operating results  million to record to the fair value of forward contracts to purchase euros to settle a purchase obligation  and an increase in salary and salary related expenses due to increases in headcount 
acquisition related costs of million were included in fiscal  but not in fiscal  due to a change in accounting principles adopted july  earn out fair value adjustments 
the earn out fair value adjustment is a result of the earn out accrual related to the acquisition of cc and evocomm on march  interest income 
interest income decreased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june   as a result of a decrease in interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by million  as a result of the issuance of debt on march  related to the acquisition of cc and evocomm 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased as a result of the increase in income before income taxes partially offset by a decrease in our effective rate to for the year ended june  from for the year ended june  the effective rate for the year ended june  included a net benefit for non recurring tax adjustments which primarily represented research and development tax credits related to fiscal years through our effective rate for fiscal excluding these non recurring items was 
the effective rate for the year ended june  includes a discrete tax benefit associated with non taxable life insurance proceeds due to the passing of our former president and a research and development tax credit

on may   we entered into amendment no 
to our committed secured credit facility with citibank  na citibank 
the credit facility has been extended and expired on july  the credit facility was comprised of a million line of credit the line and a foreign exchange line in the amount of million 
the line included the following sublimits a million available for standby letters of credit  b million available for commercial letters of credit  c a line for up to two term loans  each having a term of no more than five years  in the aggregate amount of up to million that can be used for acquisitions  and d million available for revolving credit borrowings 
on july   we entered into a new secured credit facility with citibank which expires on october  replacing the credit facility above 
the credit facility is comprised of a million line of credit the line which includes the following sublimits a million available for standby letters of credit  b million available for commercial letters of credit  c a line for term loans  each having a term of no more than five years  in the aggregate amount of up to million that can be used for acquisitions  and d million available for revolving credit borrowings 
at our discretion  advances under the line bear interest at the prime rate or libor plus applicable margin based on our leverage ratio and are collateralized by a first priority security interest on all of our personal property 
at june   the applicable margin on the libor rate was basis points 
we are required to comply with various ongoing financial covenants  including with respect to the company s leverage ratio  minimum cash balance  fixed charge coverage ratio and ebitda minimums  with which we were in compliance at june  as of june   million was outstanding under the cc and comsource acquisition loans  of which million was due within one year 
in addition  there were standby letters of credit of approximately million  which were applied against and reduced the amounts available under the credit facility as of june  we entered into  and simultaneously closed  an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement as of april  with comsource inc comsource 
pursuant to the merger agreement  a newly formed subsidiary merged with and into comsource in exchange for an initial cash purchase price of million  funded through million of existing cash and million through the comsource acquisition loan 
to the extent that working capital at the effective time was less or more than  there may be a post closing adjustment to the purchase price 
the comsource acquisition loan provides that we will pay to citibank  na sixty consecutive monthly principal installments of  each plus applicable interest 
former comsource shareholders are also entitled to receive additional cash payments of up to an aggregate of million  subject to an earn out based upon the acquired business achieving certain earnings milestones within months following the closing 
we lease satellite space segment services and other equipment and office space under various operating lease agreements  which expire in various years through fiscal future minimum lease payments due on these leases through june  are approximately million 
we expect that our cash and working capital requirements for operating activities may increase as we continue to implement our business strategy 
management anticipates additional working capital requirements for work in progress for orders as obtained and that we may periodically experience negative cash flows due to variances in quarter to quarter operating performance and if cash is used to fund any future acquisitions of complementary businesses  technologies and intellectual property 
we will use existing working capital and  if required  use our credit facility to meet these additional working capital requirements 
our future capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including the success of our marketing efforts in the services and infrastructure solutions business  the nature and timing of customer orders and the level of capital requirements related to the expansion of our service offerings 
based on current plans  we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements at least through june  however  we cannot assure you that there will be no unforeseen events or circumstances that would consume available resources significantly before that time 
additional funds may not be available when needed and  even if available  additional funds may be raised through financing arrangements and or the issuance of preferred or common stock or convertible securities on terms and prices significantly more favorable than those of the currently outstanding common stock  which could have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or rights of our existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are unavailable  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some of our operating activities  including  without limitation  capital expenditures  research and development activities  and the timing and extent of our marketing programs  and we may be required to reduce headcount 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments at june   we had contractual obligations and commercial commitments as follows in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases long term debt total contractual obligations amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts less than more than other commercial commitments committed year years years years standby letters of credit total commercial commitments our tax liability for uncertain tax positions was approximately million at june  until formal resolutions are reached between us and the tax authorities  the timing and amount of a possible audit settlement for uncertain tax benefits is not practicable 
therefore  we do not include this obligation in the table of contractual obligations 
in june  the company and the former owners of cc and evocomm reached a settlement agreement on the second earn out period related to the acquisition of cc and evocomm resulting in a million liability for the final earn out as of june  in july the million was paid to the former shareholders 
as part of the acquisition of comsource  the former comsource shareholders are also entitled to receive additional cash payments of up to an aggregate of million  subject to an earn out based upon the acquired business achieving certain earnings milestones within months following the closing 
the company has estimated the fair value of the earn out to be million as of june  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to a variety of risks  including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations relating to certain purchases from foreign vendors 
in the normal course of business  we assess these risks and have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values 
our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with foreign currency exchange rates 
accordingly  we may utilize from time to time foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposure on firm commitments denominated in foreign currency 
in january  we entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to purchase approximately million euros to cover specific purchase commitments for material for an infrastructure program 
in july  october and january  the company purchased approximately million  million  and million euros  respectively  under these forward exchange contracts 
we recorded approximately million gain to general and administrative expense in the year ended june  to adjust these contracts to market value 
at june  we had no outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates primarily from rates earned on our excess available cash balances and from our variable interest rate long term debt 
under our current positions  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
a change in our interest rate of basis points on our long term debt would have resulted in additional interest expense of approximately  in the year ended june
