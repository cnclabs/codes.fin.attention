critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue  operating income and net income  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition and estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
we discuss below the assumptions  judgments and estimates associated with these policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on our critical accounting policies  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we derive our revenues primarily from professional fees earned on consulting engagements  product sales in our defense technology development practice  fees earned for the use of our equipment and facilities  as well as reimbursements for outside direct expenses associated with the services that are billed to our clients 
substantially all of our engagements are performed under time and material or fixed price billing arrangements 
for time and material and fixed price projects  revenue is generally recognized as the services are performed 
for substantially all of our fixed price engagements we recognize revenue based on the relationship of incurred labor hours at standard rates to our estimate of the total labor hours at standard rates we expect to incur over the term of the contract 
our estimate of total labor hours we expect to incur over the term of the contract is based on the nature of the project and our past experience on similar projects 
we believe this methodology achieves a reliable measure of the revenue from the consulting services we provide to our customers under fixed price contracts 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenues recognized in any accounting period 
these judgments and estimates include an assessment of collectibility and  for fixed price engagements  an estimate as to the total effort required to complete the project 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates  the amount and timing of our revenue for any period could be materially different 
all contracts are subject to review by management  which requires a positive assessment of the collectibility of contract amounts 
if  during the course of the contract  we determine that collection of revenue is not reasonably assured  we do not recognize the revenue until its collection becomes reasonably assured  which in those situations would generally be upon receipt of cash 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the client  as well as the credit worthiness of the client 
losses on fixed price contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes evident 
contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated total costs of the contract exceeds the total fixed price of the contract 
estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must make estimates of our ability to collect accounts receivable and our unbilled work in process 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debts  customer concentration  customer credit worthiness  current economic conditions  aging of amounts due and changes in customer payment terms 
as of december   our accounts receivable balance was  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of

this growth was due to solid overall demand and particularly strong performances in our defense technology development and mechanics and materials practices  as well as our environmental and health groups 
we continued to work on a steady flow of reactive projects related to litigation  insurance claims and product recalls for which we were able to perform in depth scientific research and analysis to determine what happened 
during the year we were engaged by our clients on some major projects 
we leveraged our unique engineering and scientific consulting expertise to address the key technical issues  as well as the potential health and environmental impacts 
during fiscal  we were also successful in expanding our client base in defense technology development to include three european countries 
throughout the year we experienced growth in regulatory compliance services as we helped clients complete the necessary scientific studies to meet the first major milestone in complying with the reach regulation in the european union 
net income increased and diluted earnings per share increased to per share as compared to per share last year 
we were able to improve profitability and margins by effectively managing headcount over the past year to align our resources with demand and benefited from some major projects which resulted in improved utilization and increased leverage of our cost structure 
utilization for fiscal increased to as compared to during the prior year 
for we expect to be focused on selectively hiring new talent  continuing to manage our other operating and general and administrative expenses  generating additional cash from operations  maintaining a strong balance sheet  and undertaking activities such as share repurchases to enhance shareholder value

recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a new revenue recognition standard for arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the new standard permits entities to initially use management s best estimate of selling price to value individual deliverables when those deliverables do not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value or when third party evidence is not available 
additionally  the new standard modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated 
table of contents across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration 
also in october  the fasb amended the accounting standards for revenue recognition to exclude software contained within certain qualifying tangible products from the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance if the software is essential to the tangible product s functionality 
these new standards are effective for annual periods beginning after june  and are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal we do not expect the adoption of these standards to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

table of contents non gaap financial measures regulation g  conditions for use of non generally accepted accounting principles non gaap financial measures  and other sec regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non gaap financial information 
generally  a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance  financial position or cash flow that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
we closely monitor two financial measures  ebitda and ebitdas  which meet the definition of non gaap financial measures 
we define ebitda as net income before income taxes  interest income  depreciation and amortization 
we define ebitdas as ebitda before stock based compensation 
the company regards ebitda and ebitdas as useful measures of operating performance and cash flow to complement operating income  net income and other gaap financial performance measures 
additionally  management believes that ebitda and ebitdas provide meaningful comparisons of past  present and future operating results 
these measures are used to evaluate our financial results  develop budgets and determine employee compensation 
these measures  however  should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute or superior to  operating income  cash flows  or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
a reconciliation of the non gaap measures to the nearest comparable gaap measure is set forth below 
the following table shows ebitda as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements for fiscal years  and in thousands  except percentages fiscal years revenues before reimbursements ebitda ebitda as a of revenues before reimbursements the increase in ebitda as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in utilization and our efforts to manage our cost structure 
utilization for fiscal increased to as compared to during fiscal in fiscal  we were able to maintain ebitda as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements as compared to fiscal through our efforts to manage our cost structure by reducing discretionary spending and negotiating favorable agreements with our vendors 
in fiscal  we expect ebitda as a percentage of revenues before reimbursements to be slightly lower than fiscal

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk exponent is exposed to interest rate risk associated with our balances of cash and cash equivalents 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio primarily consisting of debt instruments with high credit quality and relatively short average effective maturities in accordance with the company s investment policy 
the maximum effective maturity of any issue in our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments is years and the maximum average effective maturity of the portfolio cannot exceed months 
if interest rates were to instantaneously increase or decrease by basis points  the change in the fair value of our portfolio of cash equivalents would not have a material impact on our financial statements 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risk  there can be no assurances that we will be adequately protected against the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
we are exposed to some foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign operations 
given the limited nature of these operations  we believe that any exposure would be minimal
