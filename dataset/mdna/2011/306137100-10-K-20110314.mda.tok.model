investors are cautioned that any forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve significant risks and uncertainties  and that actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
overview our results of operations for were overshadowed by our discovery  in september   that improper payments had been made in connection with a customer s licensing of software from us 
following the discovery of the improper payments  reijane huai  our president and chief executive officer  and the chairman of our board of directors  resigned from all positions with the company 
we conducted an internal investigation of the issue and we are being investigated by the united states attorney s office for the eastern district of new york and by the securities and exchange commission 
in addition  stockholder lawsuits have been filed against the company 
the investigations and the lawsuits are more fully described in part  item legal proceedings of this annual report on form k 
in response to these events  we made several changes to our management 
in september  james mcniel  previously a vice president and our chief strategy officer  was initially appointed interim chief executive officer and interim president 
james weber  a vice president and our chief financial officer  was given the additional title and responsibilities of interim chief operating officer 
eli oxenhorn  one of our directors  was named non executive chairman of the board of directors 
together  messrs 
mcniel  weber and oxenhorn conducted a thorough review of our operations and began to implement changes 
some of these changes are as follows in january  mr 
mcniel was appointed chief executive officer and president 
also in january  john turner was named vice president of sales for north america 
additional changes were made in the leadership of our engineering and support organizations 
the discovery of the improper payments and the ongoing investigations and civil lawsuits distracted us from  and continue to cause distraction to  our efforts to promote  market and sell our goods and services 
in addition  these events could negatively impact the perception that customers or potential customers have of our company which could reduce our potential revenues 
we cannot predict how long the external investigations or the stockholder lawsuits will last or what the outcomes will be 
we have also incurred  and will continue to incur  significant expenses  primarily for legal counsel and legal services providers  due to the internal and external investigations 
at december   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately million  compared with million at december  we anticipate a further decrease in our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities due to the costs resulting from the internal and external investigations 
with regard to our business operations  on a year over year basis we continued to see benefits from our renewed sales efforts for falconstor branded products 
we also continued to reduce costs from our operations 
despite a year over year decline in our oem product revenues  our overall total revenues declined only 
the year saw the full rollout of falconstor branded gateway appliances and complete turn key appliances with integrated disks 
these products integrate our software with standard hardware configurations 
the integrated products were created in response to feedback we received from our resellers and the end users suggested that we could increase sales if we offered turn key appliances 
we believe that the introduction of the turn key appliances had a significant impact on our revenues in while our non oem channel and direct product revenues only increased compared with  our non oem product revenues included one order by a customer which represented of our total non oem product revenues in this shows that the non oem product revenues of our branded appliances increased dramatically in compared with we are continuing to invest in our falconstor branded products and in our channel development and marketing activities 
we expect that these investments will result in further increases in non oem product revenue in as we expected  our oem product revenues continued to decline in during  two of our largest oem customers emc  and sun microsystems became involved in transactions that had substantial negative effects on our revenues 
in july  emc acquired data domain  inc this acquisition resulted in changes to emc s product lines and sales and marketing focus 
as result  sales of the emc products that incorporate our software continued to decline 
total revenue from emc on an annual basis was still more than of our total revenue for  but a substantial portion of that revenue was attributable to maintenance and support fees for existing deployments  rather than for sales of new emc products that incorporate our software 
our agreement with emc runs through  but there are no minimum revenue commitments from emc 
we do not expect that emc will account for or more of our revenue in any future period 
in june  oracle corporation announced that it had reached an agreement to buy sun microsystems 
before completing the acquisition  oracle was required to get approval for the purchase from various jurisdictions worldwide 
this approval process took several months  and at various points the statements of the regulators cast doubt on whether the transaction would be approved 
ultimately  the purchase of sun was not completed until january during this period of delay and uncertainty  sun suffered a substantial decline in its sales  including sales of the sun products that incorporate our software 
oracle has since discontinued the sun product line that incorporated our software 
we will continue to receive revenue for a period of time for support and maintenance of the existing installed sun customer base  but the revenue will continue to decline 
collectively  these two merger and acquisition events continued to cause a decline in our oem product revenues 
oem product revenues declined in from overall  our total revenues for the full year decreased to million from million in this is a year over year decrease in total revenues 
we currently anticipate that revenue will increase in compared with net loss for the year was million compared with a net loss of million in as discussed more fully below  included in our net loss for the year ended december  was an income tax provision of million  compared with an income tax benefit of million for the same period in we had stock based compensation expense which relates to stock options and restricted stock we grant to employees  officers and directors as part of our incentive compensation plan  and to some consultants as payment for services of million in and million in  which is reflected in the net results for each year 
typically  we look to operating income as another measure of our progress 
this number enables us to measure and to compare our results of operations from one year to the next 
operating loss for was million  compared with operating loss of million in these numbers again include stock based compensation expense 
we attribute the decline in operating income from to primarily to the decrease in our oem product revenues as discussed above and expenditures related to the governmental investigations 
as we expected  our gross margin showed a decline in from sales of falconstor branded turn key appliances require us to purchase hardware from third party vendors 
our margins on the resale of the hardware as part of an appliance are significantly lower than our margins on sales of software only solutions  particularly sales to oems 
because sales of appliances have become the core of our business plan  our margins were bound to decrease 
operating margin is a measure of operating efficiency 
we incur research and development expenses before the product is offered for licensing 
these expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for engineering and testing  but also include other items such as the depreciation and amortization of hardware and software used in development 
we also have expenses for software support  sales and marketing  and general and administrative functions 
our operating margin decreased in to  compared with in the impact of the equity based compensation expense on operating margin in and was equivalent to and  respectively 
the key factors we look to for our future business prospects are our ability to establish and to expand relationships with resellers  and sales and re orders by those resellers  growth in deferred revenue  the development and sales of our new products  re orders from existing customers  and the growth of the overall market for data protection and storage solutions 
we anticipate that in product revenue by resellers and  to a lesser extent  direct licenses to end users  will continue to grow in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales 
increasing sales from our non oem business remains an area of focus for us and we have installed new leadership and made significant investments in our sales force and in our marketing team to help grow these sales 
we expect these investments to take time to increase our sales 
we also have instituted  and we will be instituting further  support  training and incentive programs intended to increase sales by resellers 
we continue to enhance our reseller program 
many enterprises look to value added resellers or solution providers to assist them in making their information technology purchases 
these resellers typically review an enterprise s needs and suggest a hardware  software  or combined hardware and software solution to fulfill the enterprise s requirements 
as service providers to companies  resellers reputations are dependent on satisfying their customers needs efficiently and effectively 
resellers have wide choices in fulfilling their customers needs 
if resellers determine that a product they have been providing to their customers is not functioning as promised  or is not providing adequate return on investment  or if the customers are not satisfied with the level of support they are receiving from the suppliers  the resellers will move quickly to offer different solutions to their customers 
additional sales by resellers are therefore an important indicator of our business prospects 
in  we signed agreements with new resellers worldwide 
the type of resellers with whom we are signing agreements has continued to evolve 
while we still sign agreements with strong local and regional resellers  we have also entered into reseller agreements with national and multi national resellers who have their own distribution networks 
the enhanced distribution and marketing networks offered by these larger resellers should help us to continue to grow our sales 
we also terminated relationships with resellers who we believed were not properly selling our products in we will continue to enter into relationships with resellers and to discontinue relationships with resellers with whom we are not satisfied 
our deferred revenues consist primarily of amounts attributable to future support and maintenance of our products 
the level of deferred revenue is an important indicator of our success 
maintenance and support for our products is sold for fixed periods of time 
maintenance and support agreements are typically for one year  although some agreements are for terms in excess of one year 
if we do not deliver the support needed by end users of our products or by our oem partners and resellers  then they will not renew their maintenance and support agreements 
if end users stop using our products  they also will not renew their maintenance and support agreements 
an increase in deferred revenues thus indicates growth in our installed base and end user and oem satisfaction with our products and our maintenance and support services 
our deferred revenue increased to million as of december   compared with million as of december  we expect deferred revenue to continue to grow in at the start of  we instituted cost controls and new restrictions on hiring in an effort to better align our cost structure with our anticipated revenues 
these efforts paid off as our operating expenses decreased in from million in to million in by way of comparison  our operating expenses increased by from to and by from to we did anticipate even greater savings in  however the costs of our internal investigation of the misconduct that came to light  the government investigations  and the stockholder lawsuits negated some of our anticipated improvement in cost containment 
these costs  primarily related to professional fees and fees for service providers  amounted to over million 
we expect costs related to the governmental investigations and the stockholder suits to continue to impact our expenses in included in our operating expenses for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively  of share based compensation expense 
we expect to continue to be affected by seasonality of the information technology business on a quarterly basis 
historically  information technology spending has been higher in the fourth and second quarters of each calendar year  and somewhat slower in the other quarters  particularly the first quarter 
while our results were skewed by the impact of the strategic transactions affecting our oem customers  our quarterly results reflected this seasonality in  and we anticipate that our quarterly results for will show the effects of seasonality as well 
accounting rules relating to share based compensation expense continued to have a negative impact on our earnings in on an on going basis we weigh the impact of the expense on our consolidated financial statements against the impact of discontinuing the grant of equity based compensation to our worldwide workforce 
it continues to be our view that the opportunity to participate in the growth of our company is an important motivating factor for our current employees and a valuable recruiting tool for new employees 
we will thus continue to apply the criteria and the methodology we have used in the past to determine grants of stock options or other equity based compensation to our employees 
for the management of our business and the review of our progress  we will continue to look to our results before share based compensation expense 
we will use these non gaap financial measures in making operating decisions because they measure the results of our day to day operations and because they provide a more consistent basis for evaluating and comparing our results across different periods 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  during  we shifted our focus to selling turn key solutions  whereby our software is integrated with industry standard hardware and sold as one complete integrated solution 
as a result  commencing in the second quarter of  we reclassified our revenue into two categories i product revenue  and ii support and services revenue 
product revenue consists of both integrated solutions and stand alone software revenues 
support and services revenues consists of both maintenance revenues and professional services revenues 
as a result of the reclassification  we have a corresponding cost of revenues for each revenue category 
revenues for the year ended december  decreased to million compared with million for the year ended december  our cost of revenues increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  included in our cost of revenues for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively  of share based compensation expense 
our operating expenses decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  included in our operating expenses for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively  of share based compensation expense 
in addition  we incurred approximately million of legal and professional fees resulting from the internal and external investigations that commenced during the third quarter of and from stockholder lawsuits that were filed in the fourth quarter of net loss for the year ended december  was million compared with a net loss of million for the year ended december  included in our net loss for the year ended december  was an income tax provision of million  compared with an income tax benefit of million for the same period in during  as part of our income tax provision  we recorded million in connection with a valuation allowance on substantially all of our existing deferred tax assets due to our determination during the year that we would not utilize our deferred tax assets on a more likely than not basis in future periods 
the million income tax benefit recorded during the year ended december   was primarily attributable to i a benefit of million related to research and development credits we recognized during  and ii the impact of our full year effective tax rate on our pre tax losses for our overall decline in revenues was primarily due to a significant decrease in our product revenue 
this decline was partially offset by increases in our support and services revenues for the year ended december   compared with the same period in our product revenues from our non oem partners increased  while our product revenues from our oem partners decreased  for the year ended december   compared with the same period in although  we had one transaction that accounted for of the total non oem product revenue for the year ended december   our non oem product revenue still increased in as a result of our ongoing focus on the falconstor branded business for the year ended december  the decrease in our oem product revenues continues to result primarily from the merger and acquisition activity that commenced during that affected some of our key oem partners  specifically  emc and oracle usa formerly sun microsystems 
historically  both emc and sun microsystems each represented over of our annual revenues 
as we have stated over the past several quarters  we do not anticipate that revenues from either oem partner will return to their historical peaks  which has resulted in our continued and ongoing focus of the non oem falconstor branded business 
however  because of our well established installed customer base  support and services revenues continued to grow and have not been as significantly impacted by the disruptions in our oem channel 
our operating expenses have decreased 
commencing in the second quarter of  we implemented expense controls and put new restrictions on new hires 
we have begun to recognize the benefits of these cost savings initiatives  but the full impact of these initiatives have yet to be recognized on a full year basis 
we will continue to evaluate the appropriate headcount levels to properly align requirements with our current and long term outlook 
our worldwide headcount was employees as of december   compared with employees as of december  revenues year ended december  revenues product revenue support and services revenue total revenues year over year percentage growth product revenue support and services revenue total percentage growth product revenue product revenue is comprised of sales of our software integrated with industry standard hardware creating a turn key solution or integrated solution  and our stand alone software applications 
the products are sold through our oems  and through i value added resellers  ii distributors  and or iii directly to end users collectively non oems 
these revenues are recognized when  among other requirements  we receive a customer purchase order or a royalty report summarizing stand alone software applications sold  or integrated solutions are sold and or permanent key codes are delivered to the customer 
product revenue decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  product revenue represented and of our total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in product revenue was primarily attributable to a decline of in product revenue from our oem partners for the year ended december   compared with the same period in this decrease was offset partially by an increase in our non oem product revenues of for the year ended december   compared with the same period in we had one transaction that accounted for of the total non oem product revenue for the year ended december  while this one transaction was not repeated in  the absence of this revenue was offset in by increases in our non oem product revenues as a result of our ongoing focus on the falconstor branded business 
the decrease in our oem partner product revenue was primarily attributable to the impact of merger and acquisition activity involving some of our key oem partners that commenced during we do not anticipate that revenues from these oem partners will return to their historical peaks 
product revenue from our non oem partners represented and of our total product revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
product revenue from our oem partners represented and of our total product revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we continue to focus our investments on the falconstor branded non oem channel business as we feel this is in line with our long term outlook 
we anticipate that our investments in the falconstor branded business will result in our non oem generated product revenue growing at a greater rate in future years when compared to our oem generated product revenue 
support and services revenue support and services revenue is comprised of i maintenance and technical support services  ii professional services primarily related to the implementation of our software  and iii engineering services 
revenues derived from maintenance and technical support contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual maintenance term 
professional services revenue is recognized in the period that the related services are performed 
revenue from engineering services is primarily related to customizing software product masters for some of our oem partners 
revenue from engineering services is recognized in the period in which the services are completed 
support and services revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in support and services revenue was attributable to maintenance and technical support services  which increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the same period in as we are in business longer  and as we license more integrated solutions and stand alone software applications to new customers and grow our installed customer base  we expect the amount of maintenance and technical support contracts we have to grow as well 
the anticipated growth in our maintenance and technical support service revenue is expected to result primarily from i the purchase of maintenance and support contracts by our customers  and ii the renewal of maintenance and support contracts by our existing and new customers after their initial contracts expire 
professional services revenues also contributed to the increase in our support and services revenue  which increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the same period in the professional services revenue varies from year to year based upon i the number of integrated solutions sold during the existing and previous periods  ii the number of our customers who elect to purchase professional services  and iii the number of professional services contracts that were completed during the period 
we expect professional services revenues to continue to vary from year to year based upon the number of customers who elect to utilize our professional services upon purchasing any of our integrated solutions 
cost of revenues year ended december  cost of revenues product support and service total cost of revenues total gross profit gross margin product support and service total gross margin cost of revenues  gross profit and gross margin cost of product revenue consists primarily of industry standard hardware we purchase and integrate with our software for a turn key integrated solution  personnel costs  amortization of purchased and capitalized software  shipping and logistics costs  and share based compensation expense 
cost of support and service consists primarily of personnel and other costs associated with providing software implementations  technical support under maintenance contracts  training  and share based compensation expense 
cost of product revenue for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million compared with million for the same period in the increase in cost of product revenue was primarily due to the increased hardware costs associated with our new focus in on selling falconstor branded integrated turn key solutions 
our cost of support and service revenues for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million compared with million for the same period in the decrease in cost of support and service revenue is primarily related to our cost savings controls and new restrictions on new hires that were implemented during the second quarter of total gross profit decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  total gross margin decreased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in the decrease in both our total gross profit and total gross margins for the year ended december   compared with the same period in  was primarily due to i a decline in our total revenue  and ii increased hardware costs associated with our new focus in of selling falconstor branded turn key integrated solutions 
generally  our total gross profits and total gross margins may fluctuate based on several factors  including i revenue growth levels  ii changes in personnel headcount and related costs  and iii our product offerings and service mix of sales 
share based compensation expense included in the cost of product revenue was less than of revenue for both the years ended december  and december  share based compensation expense included in the cost of support and service revenue decreased to million from million for the years ended december  and december   respectively

selling and marketing expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in the decrease in selling and marketing expenses was primarily due to i lower commissions paid as a result of our decline in total revenue  and ii lower salary and personnel related costs as a result of the decline in total sales and marketing personnel

the decrease in our product revenues from our oem partners was primarily attributable to the merger and acquisition activity that adversely impacted some of our key oem partners  specifically  emc  oracle usa formerly sun microsystems and com 
additionally  as a result of the macroeconomic environment during  we continued to experience slowed revenue growth  particularly in product revenues  resulting from the downturn in information technology spending and disruptions in the global financial markets  which commenced during the third quarter of and continued throughout however  because of our well established installed customer base  our support and services revenues were not as significantly impacted as compared with our product revenues

liquidity and capital resources cash flow information is as follows years ended december  cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities balances 
our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balance as of december  totaled million  as compared with million as of december  cash and cash equivalents totaled million and marketable securities totaled million at december  as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in marketable securities 
during the second quarter of  we implemented cost savings initiatives and new restrictions on hiring in response to the operating losses we were incurring 
additionally  we continue to evaluate the appropriate headcount levels to properly align such requirements with our current and long term outlook 
we expect that these initiatives will help to bring our expense structure in line with our current revenue levels and provide a positive impact on our operating results 
we will continue to make investments in capital expenditures 
in the past  we have also used cash to purchase software licenses and to make acquisitions 
we will continue to evaluate potential software license purchases and acquisitions  and if the right opportunity presents itself  we may continue to use our cash for these purposes 
as of the date of this filing  we have no agreements  commitments or understandings with respect to any such acquisitions 
as discussed further in part i  item legal proceedings of this annual report on form k  we are currently under investigations by the united states attorney s office and the securities and exchange commission and are named in multiple lawsuits 
we have incurred  and will continue to incur  significant expenses  primarily for legal counsel and legal services providers  due to the internal and external investigations 
while these investigations will likely decrease our liquidity  we cannot predict the scope  timing  or outcome of such legal proceedings  nor can we predict what impact  if any  these matters may have on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and statement of cash flow 
we currently do not have any debt and our only significant commitments are related to our office leases 
at various times from october through february our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our outstanding common stock in the aggregate 
we did not repurchase any of our outstanding common stock during the year ended december  during  we repurchased  shares of our common stock in open market purchases at an aggregate purchase price of million 
during  we repurchased  shares of our common stock in open market purchases at an aggregate purchase price of million

in addition  during we used million for the acquisition of assets  while we did not have any acquisitions of assets in the same periods of or the cash used to purchase software licenses was million for the year ended december  we did not have any significant purchases of software licenses during the years ended december  and we continually evaluate potential software license purchases and acquisitions  and we may continue to make similar investments if we find opportunities that would benefit our business 
we anticipate continued capital expenditures as we continue to invest in our infrastructure 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared with net cash used in financing activities of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds received from the exercise of stock options

cash inflows from financing activities were also impacted by the tax benefits recognized as a result of excess stock based compensation deductions and exercises of stock options 
as discussed in note fair value measurements to our consolidated financial statements  we utilize unobservable level inputs in determining the fair value of auction rate securities we hold 
as of december  and december   million and million at par value  respectively  of our investments was comprised of auction rate securities 
liquidity for these auction rate securities is typically provided by an auction process  which allows holders to sell their notes  and resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals 
over the past three years we have experienced failed auctions on our auction rate securities 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not be matched with an adequate volume of buyers 
in the event that there is a failed auction  the indenture governing the security requires the issuer to pay interest at a contractually defined rate that is generally above market rates for other types of similar short term instruments 
the securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest at the contractual rate and continue to reset the next auction date every days until the auction succeeds  the issuer calls the securities  or they mature 
because there is no assurance that auctions for these securities will be successful in the near term and due to our ability and intent to hold these securities to maturity  the auction rate securities were classified as long term investments in our consolidated balance sheet at both december  and our auction rate securities are classified as available for sale securities and are reflected at fair value 
in prior periods during the auction process  quoted market prices were readily available  which would qualify as level under fasb authoritative guidance 
over the past three years  the auction events for most of these instruments failed and  therefore  we have determined the estimated fair values of these securities utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis or other type of valuation model 
these analyses consider  among other items  the collateral underlying the security  the creditworthiness of the issuer  the timing of the expected future cash flows  including the final maturity  associated with the securities  and an assumption of when the next time the security is expected to have a successful auction 
these securities were also compared  when possible  to other observable and relevant market data  which is limited at this time 
as a result  we reclassified these instruments as level unobservable inputs within our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we recorded a cumulative temporary decline in fair value of approximately  in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
as of december   we recorded  cumulatively as an other than temporary impairment and a cumulative temporary decline in fair value of approximately  in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
during the fourth quarter of   of our auction rate securities were called by the issuer at par value  including amounts previously recognized as an other than temporary impairment 
we believe that the temporary declines in fair value are primarily due to liquidity concerns and are not due to the creditworthiness of the remaining underlying assets  because the majority of the underlying securities are almost entirely backed by the us government 
however  if at any time in the future a determination that a valuation adjustment is other than temporary  we will record a charge to earnings in the period of determination 
our holdings of auction rate securities at par value represented approximately and of our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities balance as of december  and december   respectively  which we believe allows us sufficient time for the securities to return to full value or to be refinanced by the issuer 
because we believe that the decline in fair value deemed to be temporary is primarily due to liquidity issues in the credit markets  any difference between our estimate and an estimate that would be arrived at by another party would have no impact on our earnings  since such difference would also be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss 
we will continue to re evaluate each of these factors as market conditions change in subsequent periods 
we currently do not have any debt and our only material cash commitments are related to our office leases 
we have an operating lease covering our corporate office facility that expires in february we also have several operating leases related to offices in the united states and foreign countries 
the expiration dates for these leases range from through the following is a schedule of future minimum lease payments for all operating leases as of december year ending december  we believe that our current balance of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  and our expected cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
see item a of part i  risk factors 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and  we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable allowances  deferred income taxes  accounting for share based payments  acquisitions  goodwill and other intangible assets  and fair value measurements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the fasb on revenue recognition 
product revenue is recognized only when pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the fee is fixed and determinable  among other criteria 
an arrangement is evidenced by a signed customer contract  a customer purchase order  and or a royalty report summarizing software licenses sold for each software license resold by an oem  distributor or solution provider to an end user 
product fees are fixed and determinable as our standard payment terms range from to days  depending on regional billing practices  and we have not provided any of our customers with extended payment terms 
when a customer purchases our integrated solutions and or licenses software together with the purchase of maintenance  we allocate a portion of the fee to maintenance for its fair value based on the contractual maintenance renewal rate 
accounts receivable 
we review accounts receivable to determine which are doubtful of collection 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance for uncollectible accounts and returns  we consider i historical return rates  ii specific past due accounts  iii analysis of our accounts receivable aging  iv customer payment terms  v historical collections  write offs and returns  vi changes in customer demand and relationships  vii actual cash collections on our accounts receivables and viii concentrations of credit risk and customer credit worthiness 
as part of our determination of the appropriate allowance for uncollectable accounts each period  the actual customer collections of outstanding account receivable balances impact the required allowance for doubtful accounts 
historically  we have experienced a somewhat consistent level of write offs and returns as a percentage of revenue due to our customer relationships  contract provisions and credit assessments 
changes in the product return rates  credit worthiness of customers  general economic conditions and other factors may impact the level of future write offs  revenues and our general and administrative expenses 
deferred income taxes 
in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the fasb on income taxes  we regularly estimate our ability to recover deferred tax assets  and report such deferred tax assets at the amount that is determined to be more likely than not recoverable 
we also have to estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items  such as the timing for recognizing revenue and expenses for tax and accounting purposes  as well as estimating foreign tax credits 
these differences may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our condensed consolidated balance sheet 
we are required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets  which include temporary differences that are expected to be deductible in future years  will be recoverable from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies 
if recovery is not likely  we have to provide a valuation allowance based on our estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions  and the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable 
the provision for current and deferred taxes involves evaluations and judgments of uncertainties in the interpretation of complex tax regulations 
this evaluation considers several factors  including an estimate of the likelihood of generating sufficient taxable income in future periods  the effect of temporary differences  the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities  past and projected taxable income  and available tax planning strategies 
accounting for share based payments 
as discussed further in note share based payment arrangements  to our consolidated financial statements  we account for stock based awards in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the fasb on stock compensation 
we have used and expect to continue to use the black scholes option pricing model to compute the estimated fair value of share based compensation expense 
the black scholes option pricing model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields  expected volatility  expected option term and risk free interest rates 
the assumptions used in computing the fair value of share based compensation expense reflect our best estimates  but involve uncertainties relating to market and other conditions  many of which are outside of our control 
we estimate expected volatility based primarily on historical daily price changes of our stock and other factors 
the expected option term is the number of years that we estimate that the stock options will be outstanding prior to exercise 
the expected term of the awards issued prior to january   was determined using the simplified method prescribed in sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
the estimated expected term of the stock awards issued since january  has been determined pursuant to sab no 
additionally  we estimate forfeiture rates based primarily upon historical experiences  adjusted when appropriate for known events or expected trends 
we may adjust share based compensation expense on a quarterly basis for changes to our estimate of expected equity award forfeitures based on our review of these events and trends  and recognize the effect of adjusting the forfeiture rate for all expense amortization in the period in which we revised the forfeiture estimate 
if other assumptions or estimates had been used  the share based compensation expense that was recorded for the years ended december    and  could have been materially different 
furthermore  if different assumptions or estimates are used in future periods  share based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the future 
acquisitions 
we account for acquisitions in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the fasb on business combinations 
pursuant to the authoritative guidance  the acquiring company must allocate the purchase price of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition  including intangible assets that can be identified 
the purchase price in excess of the fair value of the net assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill 
among other sources of relevant information  we use independent appraisals or other valuations to assist in determining the estimated and final recorded fair value of assets and liabilities acquired 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
as discussed further in note summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements  we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the fasb on goodwill and other intangibles 
the authoritative guidance requires an impairment only approach to accounting for goodwill and other intangibles with an indefinite life 
absent any prior indicators of impairment  we perform an annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of each of our fiscal year 
as of each december  and  we had million of goodwill  respectively 
as of each december  and  we had million and million net of amortization  respectively  of other identifiable intangible assets 
we do not amortize goodwill  but we assess for impairment at least annually and more often if a trigger event occurs 
we amortize identifiable intangible assets over their estimated useful lives  which typically is three years 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill using a two step process based on an evaluation of the reporting unit 
the first step involves a comparison of a reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
in the second step  if the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  we compare the goodwill s implied fair value and its carrying value 
if the goodwill s carrying value exceeds its implied fair value  we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to such excess 
we evaluate the recoverability of other identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable 
such events include significant adverse changes in business climate  several periods of operating or cash flow losses  forecasted continuing losses or a current expectation that an asset or asset a group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life 
throughout  we continually monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill impairment test 
for the periods presented  we did not identify any triggering events which would require an update to our annual impairment test 
as a measure of sensitivity  a decrease in the fair value of our reporting unit as of december  would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill 
as of both december  and  we did not record any impairment charges on either our goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets 
fair value measurement 
as discussed further in note  fair value measurements  to our consolidated financial statements  we determine fair value measurements of both financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by the fasb on fair value measurements and disclosures 
in the current market environment  the assessment of the fair value of our marketable securities  specifically our debt instruments  can be difficult and subjective 
the volume of trading activity of certain debt instruments has declined  and the rapid changes occurring in the current financial markets can lead to changes in the fair value of financial instruments in relatively short periods of time 
the fasb authoritative guidance establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value 
each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value 
level instruments represent quoted prices in active markets 
therefore  determining fair value for level instruments does not require significant management judgment  and the estimation is not difficult 
level instruments include observable inputs other than level prices  such as quoted prices for identical instruments in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions less active markets  issuer credit ratings  non binding market consensus prices that can be corroborated with observable market data  model derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities  or quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities 
these level instruments require more management judgment and subjectivity compared to level instruments 
level instruments include unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities 
the determination of fair value for level instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity 
all of our marketable debt instruments classified as level are valued using a undiscounted cash flow analysis  non binding market consensus price and or a non binding broker quote  all of which we corroborate with unobservable data 
non binding market consensus prices are based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing providers or brokers 
these valuation models incorporate a number of inputs  including non binding and binding broker quotes  observable market prices for identical and or similar securities  and the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs  and to a lesser degree non observable market inputs 
adjustments to the fair value of instruments priced using non binding market consensus prices and non binding broker quotes  and classified as level  were not significant for each of the years ended december  and other than temporary impairment after determining the fair value of our available for sale debt instruments  gains or losses on these investments are recorded to other comprehensive income  until either the investment is sold or we determine that the decline in value is other than temporary 
determining whether the decline in fair value is other than temporary requires management judgment based on the specific facts and circumstances of each investment 
for investments in debt instruments  these judgments primarily consider the financial condition and liquidity of the issuer  the issuer s credit rating  and any specific events that may cause us to believe that the debt instrument will not mature and be paid in full  and our ability and intent to hold the investment to maturity 
given the current market conditions  these judgments could prove to be wrong  and companies with relatively high credit ratings and solid financial conditions may not be able to fulfill their obligations 
as of december   our investments in marketable securities included million at par value of available for sale auction rate securities  and we did not recognize any other than temporary impairments on our available for sale auction rate securities 
as of december   our investments in marketable securities included million at par value of available for sale auction rate securities and recognized  cumulatively in other than temporary impairments on our available for sale auction rate securities
