we own and operate office  retail and showroom properties our core operations with large concentrations of office and retail properties in the new york city metropolitan area and in the washington  dc northern virginia area 
in addition  we have a interest in toys r us  inc toys which has a significant real estate component  a interest in alexander s  inc nyse alx alexander s  which has seven properties in the greater new york metropolitan area  as well as interests in other real estate and related investments 
our business objective is to maximize shareholder value  which we measure by the total return provided to our shareholders 
below is a table comparing our performance to the morgan stanley reit index rms and the snl reit index snl for the following periods ended december  total return vornado rms snl one year three year five year ten year past performance is not necessarily indicative of how we will perform in the future 
we intend to achieve our business objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and executing our operating strategies through maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit  investing in properties in select markets  such as new york city and washington  dc  where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation  acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents  investing in retail properties in select under stored locations such as the new york city metropolitan area  developing and redeveloping existing properties to increase returns and maximize value  and investing in operating companies that have a significant real estate component 
we expect to finance our growth  acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds  proceeds from possible asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets 
we may also offer vornado common or preferred shares or operating partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities in the future 
we compete with a large number of real estate property owners and developers  some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments 
principal factors of competition are rents charged  attractiveness of location  the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided 
our success depends upon  among other factors  trends of the national  regional and local economies  the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers  availability and cost of capital  construction and renovation costs  taxes  governmental regulations  legislation and population trends 
see risk factors in item a for additional information regarding these factors 
substantially all businesses  including ours  were negatively affected by the economic recession and illiquidity and volatility in the capital and financial markets 
although there are signs of an economic recovery and greater stability in the capital and financial markets  it is not possible for us to predict whether these trends will continue in the future or quantify the impact of these or any other trends on our financial results

recently issued accounting literature in the fourth quarter of  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an update to the guidance contained in accounting standards codification asc  receivables 
the new guidance requires companies to provide more information about the credit quality of their financing receivables in the disclosures to financial statements including  but not limited to  significant purchases and sales of financing receivables  aging information and credit quality indicators 
the adoption of this accounting guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on january   the fasb issued an update to asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  adding new requirements for disclosures about transfers into and out of levels and fair value measurements and additional disclosures about the activity within level fair value measurements 
the adoption of this guidance on january  did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued an update to asc  consolidation  which modifies the existing quantitative guidance used in determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie by requiring entities to qualitatively assess whether an enterprise is a primary beneficiary  based on whether the entity has i power over the significant activities of the vie  and ii an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the vie 
the adoption of this guidance on january  did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements we have made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
real estate real estate is carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
as of december  and  the carrying amounts of real estate  net of accumulated depreciation  were billion and billion  respectively 
maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
depreciation requires an estimate by management of the useful life of each property and improvement as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components 
if we do not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our real estate  depreciation expense may be misstated 
as real estate is undergoing development activities  all property operating expenses  including interest expense  are capitalized to the cost of real property to the extent we believe such costs are recoverable through the value of the property 
upon the acquisition of real estate  we assess the fair value of acquired assets including land  buildings and improvements  identified intangibles such as acquired above and below market leases and acquired in place leases and tenant relationships and acquired liabilities and we allocate purchase price based on these assessments 
we assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors  including historical operating results  known trends and market economic conditions 
our properties  including any related intangible assets  are individually reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over the anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis 
an impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the property s carrying amount over its estimated fair value 
impairment analyses are based on our current plans  intended holding periods and available market information at the time the analyses are prepared 
if our estimates of the projected future cash flows  anticipated holding periods  or market conditions change  our evaluation of impairment losses may be di fferent and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based  in part  on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results 
plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses 
critical accounting policies continued identified intangibles as of december  and  the carrying amounts of identified intangible assets including acquired above market leases  tenant relationships and acquired in place leases were  and  respectively 
the carrying amounts of identified intangible liabilities  a component of deferred credit on our consolidated balance sheets  were  and  respectively 
identified intangibles are recorded at their estimated fair value  separate and apart from goodwill 
identified intangibles that are determined to have finite lives are amortized over the period in which they are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the property or business acquired 
intangible assets that are subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indi cate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of the identified intangible over its estimated fair value 
if intangible assets are impaired or estimated useful lives change  the impact to our consolidated financial statements could be material 
mezzanine loans receivable as of december  and  the carrying amounts of mezzanine loans receivable were  and  respectively  net of valuation allowances of  and  respectively 
we invest in mezzanine loans of entities that have significant real estate assets 
these investments  which are subordinate to the mortgage loans secured by the real property  are generally secured by pledges of the equity interests of the entities owning the underlying real estate 
we record these investments at the stated principal amount net of any unamortized discount or premium 
we accrete or amortize any discount or premium over the life of the related receivable utilizing the effective interest method or straight line method  if the result is not materially different 
we evaluate the collectability of both interest and principal of each of our loans whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such amounts may not be recoverable 
a loan is impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms 
when a loan is impaired  the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the investment to the estimated fair value of the loan or  as a practical expedient  to the value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
if our estimates of the collectability of both interest and principal or the fair value of our loans change based on market conditions or otherwise  our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
partially owned entities as of december  and  the carrying amounts of investments in partially owned entities  including alexander s and toys r us  were billion and billion  respectively 
in determining whether we have a controlling interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity  we consider factors such as ownership interest  board representation  management representation  authority to make decisions  and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners members as well as whether the entity is a variable interest entity in which we have the power over significant activities of the entity and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the entity 
we account for investments on the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not met and we have significant influence over the operations of the investee 
equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions each period 
investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for on the cost method 
investments in partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of an investment over its estimated fair value 
impairment analyses are based on current plans  intended holding periods and available information at the time the analyses are prepared 
the ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors  including the performance of each investment and market conditions 
if our estimates of the projected future cash flows  the nature of development activities for properties for which such activities are planned and the estimated fair value of the investment change based on market conditions or otherwise  our evaluat ion of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based  in part  on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results 
critical accounting policies continued allowance for doubtful accounts we periodically evaluate the collectability of amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts  and  as of december  and for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under their lease agreements 
we also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from the straight lining of rents  and  as of december  and  respectively 
this receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements 
management exercises judgment in establishing these allowances and considers payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates 
these estimates may differ from actual results  which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies base rent income arising from tenant leases 
these rents are recognized over the non cancelable term of the related leases on a straight line basis which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases 
we commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use 
in addition  in circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant  we recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
percentage rent income arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon tenant sales exceeding defined thresholds 
these rents are recognized only after the contingency has been removed ie  when tenant sales thresholds have been achieved 
hotel revenue income arising from the operation of the hotel pennsylvania which consists of rooms revenue  food and beverage revenue  and banquet revenue 
income is recognized when rooms are occupied 
food and beverage and banquet revenue are recognized when the services have been rendered 
trade shows revenue income arising from the operation of trade shows  including rentals of booths 
this revenue is recognized when the trade shows have occurred 
expense reimbursements revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective property 
this revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred 
management  leasing and other fees income arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities 
this revenue is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements 
before we recognize revenue  we assess  among other things  its collectibility 
if our assessment of the collectibility of revenue changes  the impact on our consolidated financial statements could be material 
income taxes we operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust reit under sections of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
under those sections  a reit which distributes at least of its reit taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders 
we distribute to our shareholders of our taxable income 
therefore  no provision for federal income taxes is required 
if we fail to distribute the required amount of income to our shareholders  or fail to meet other reit requirements  we may fail to qualify as a reit which may result in substantial adverse tax consequences

ffo and ffo per diluted share are used by management  investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales  which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time  rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flows as a liquidity measure

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates 
market interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control

we may utilize various financial instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings  including hedging strategies  depending on our analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies

as of december   we have investments in mezzanine loans with an aggregate carrying amount of  that are based on variable interest rates which partially mitigate our exposure to a change in interest rates on our variable rate debt 
fair value of debt the estimated fair value of our consolidated debt is calculated based on current market prices and discounted cash flows at the current rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt 
as of december   the estimated fair value of our consolidated debt was  derivative instruments we have  and may in the future enter into  derivative positions that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  including our economic interest in jc penney common shares 
because these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  the gains or losses resulting from their mark to market at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in interest and other investment income loss  net on our consolidated statements of income 
in addition  we are  and may in the future be  subject to additional expense based on the notional amount of the derivative positions and a specified spread over libor 
because the market value of these instruments can vary significantly between periods  we may experience significant fluctuations in the amount of our investment income or expense in any given period
